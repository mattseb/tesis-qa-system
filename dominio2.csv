 United States ,,"In the United States, 17 states have laws regarding electronics recycling. The non-profit National Center for Electronics Recycling calls it ""patchwork of state regulations""."
 United States , California ,"The Electronic Waste Recycling Fee is a fee imposed by the government of the state of California in the United States on new purchases of electronic products with viewable screens. It is one of the key elements of the California Electronic Waste Recycling Act. Retailers submit the collected fees to the Board of Equalization. Retailers may pay the fee on behalf of the consumer, however the retailer must remit the same amount to the State and indicate the amount on the consumer receipt. Retailers may retain 3% of the collected fees in order to recoup costs of collection."
 United States , California ,"The fees collected reimburse a number of recycling centers, who in turn offer free recycling of e-waste to consumers and businesses. The statutory recycling fees are adjusted every one to two years by the state on or before August 1 of the year. Sellers and manufacturers are subject to civil fines for failing to collect and remit the fee. Fees are collected for the following CEDs (Covered Electronic Devices): Televisions that contain cathode ray tubes, liquid crystal displays, or plasma screens. Computer monitors that contain cathode ray tubes or use liquid crystal displays."
 United States , California ,"Laptop computers and Portable DVD players with liquid crystal displays. ""Bare"" cathode ray tubes or any other product that contains a cathode ray tube."
 United States , Washington ,"In Washington, a law passed in 2006 requires manufacturers to be responsible for recycling their products at the ends of their lifetimes. 212 manufacturers created an industry association for this purpose which charges manufacturers based on their market share and the amount of items being recycled. In Europe, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive requires member countries of the European Union to allow consumers to recycle electronics free of charge."
 United States , Washington ,"This is funded by national ""producer compliance schemes"", into which manufacturers and distributors pay an annual fee for the collection and recycling of associated waste electronics from household waste recycling centres. Waste legislation California State Board of Equalization Ewaste items list"
 History of regulation ,,"Up until 1965, there was no federal legislation regulating the disposal of solid and hazardous waste in the United States. The Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) was passed by Congress in 1965. A major amendment to SWDA was the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), passed by Congress in 1976. The RCRA gives the EPA the ability to regulate the flow of hazardous waste for the entire lifetime of the product, including development, transport, and disposal."
 History of regulation ,,"In 1986, a cargo vessel carrying 14,000 tons of toxic waste left Philadelphia and traveled around the world for more than five months continually being turned away from areas where it attempted to dump its contents. Eventually, much of the toxic waste was dumped into the Indian Ocean. This event sparked some of the current efforts to regulate the flows of electronic waste and ensure the health and safety of the global environment. The U.S. has not enacted a federal law to regulate the domestic recycling of e-waste, but, some states are implementing policies to address its increasing accumulation."
 History of regulation ,,"When electronic products stop functioning, they are either incinerated, landfilled, or recycled to salvage materials and protect public health and the environment by removing its toxic materials. Despite attempts to push federal e-waste bills forward, which stem as far back as the 1990s, US states have held the most legislative agency on e-waste. So far, 25 states have enacted legislation to regulate statewide e-waste recycling initiatives, which means 65% of the population must uphold their state's e-waste recycling policies."
 History of regulation ,,"Every state with e-waste regulation laws, expect Utah and California, use the Producer Responsibility approach to hold manufacturers accountable by making them fund e-waste recycling. But, because state e-waste laws vary, the effectiveness of the laws in regulating environmental and health harms can differ. Because the US has not ratified the Basel Convention on hazardous waste, the US can export e-waste to countries where the dismantling and recycling of e-waste are cheaper due to lax environmental and workplace regulations."
 History of regulation ,,"Because the US does not have federal or intergovernmental e-waste policies and electronics producers still manufacture products with hazardous materials, e-waste is oftentimes dismantled without strict regulations or compliance so substances like heavy metals, flame retardants, and plastics produce public health risks. Due to the unregulated nature of the informal recycling sector in developing countries, US e-waste handlers are exporting resources which could have detrimental effects on not only humans handling the e-waste, but also the environment in areas where the e-waste is exported."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"Electronic devices are combinations of hundreds of different types of materials; many of them are considered to be toxic when exposed to humans. Although present within the device, these toxic heavy metals have only been documented to become a health hazard once the device is broken down. The process of electrical device breakdown occurs in a variety of locations and settings (recycling sites, storage locations), yet becomes a prominent health hazard when broken down in domestic or international sites that do not have the correct equipment or recycling methods."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"When taken apart without proper recycling methods, tools, or protective wear, workers and residents become exposed to the toxic chemicals in the devices. E-waste negatively impacts health primarily through the exposure of heavy metal dioxins. Incinerating e-waste without proper workplace and environmental regulations poses a risk because it generates dioxins, which can cause cancer and plague the human body and environment for long periods of time. Moreover, open burning, a common practice in developing countries receiving e-waste, releases toxic fumes and dust that can be easily inhaled and effect nearby food sources and water bodies."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"In addition to direct exposure through open burning and dismantling, e-waste storages and landfills can result in leakage of dioxins into the natural surroundings area."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"These dioxins are able to permeate the soil and contaminate ground water and nearby vegetation; not only does ecological contamination negatively affect overall ecosystem function, but it is another method in which all living organisms' health risks increase dramatically.A few of these chemicals include: Flame retardants: Some flame retardants like Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs), which can be found in e-waste plastic to make electronic products more flame resistant, are emitted into the environment through e-waste dismantling and become dust and air. BFRs are one of the materials that are used in the making of circuit boards and plastic casings."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"BFRs, which are fat-soluble, bioaccumulate causing short-term effects, such as seizures and mountain sickness, and long-term effects, such as neurological disorders and endocrine disruption. PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers), a class of BFRs, interfere with brain development of animals and in the hormones associated with sexual development. Specifically birds near processing sites who often carry these compounds in their shell. Long Term exposure to this toxin can result in problems concerning learning capability and memory function. Because of their toxicity, electronic manufacturers are phasing out BFRs."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"Lead: One can be exposed to lead through inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact, which could produce short-term effects, such as nausea, vomiting, convulsions, coma, or even death, and long-term effects, such as anemia, abdominal pain, encephalopathy, and nephropathy. Metallic lead exists in the electrical circuit boards and lead oxide is a component of the cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and is used to connect the glass face plate with funnel sections. Lead can be found in lead-acid batteries, solders, and in televisions and monitors."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"Lead can leach from CRTs in landfill conditions, be released into the air through incineration, glass crushing, or high temperature processing. Similar to other toxins, lead can accumulate in the human body and biomass over a long period of time and can have damaging impacts on the nervous, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. Lead is found in such high quantities of electronic waste that in the United States, prison recycling programs were found to have 50 times the safe level set by the EPA."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"Also, in China, children living near electronic waste processing sites are recorded to have 3 times the safe level of lead in their blood. Cadmium: Cadmium is another metal, which is found in rechargeable batteries and ""phosphor"" coatings in older cathode ray tubes (CRTs). Cadmium compounds are used in a variety of electronic products, their functions ranging from stabilizing PVC formations to serving as wire insulators. Cadmium is a rare metal that is very toxic to plants, animals, and humans and is released into the air by incineration or poorly executed dismantling."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"When released, cadmium commonly accumulates in nearby crops, resulting in the additional exposure to humans and animals. Occupationally, fumes and dust containing cadmium compounds, a known carcinogen, can be inhaled directly and long term exposure results in kidney failure and bone problems. Heart disease, hypertension, and lung cancer are other health effects of cadmium inhalation. Cadmium exposure can lead to developmental issues involving motor skills, cognition, and learning. It can also potentially cause harm to kidneys. Mercury: Mercury is primarily utilized in the lighting mechanisms for flat-screen devices."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"Mercury is a highly toxic chemical that can have fatal or severely damaging effects on the human central nervous system, especially during early development ages. As one of the most toxic and popular metals used in electronic products, mercury is an e-waste pollutant that can affect humans through inhalation and skin contact. It is known to cause short-term effects, such as vomiting, fever, and diarrhea, and in the long-term, can cause tremors, nausea, neuroasthenia, and hypersensitivity. Because of its widespread application, mercury can be found in common household products like batteries, fluorescent lamps, and thermostats."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,"One end-of-life treatment for electronic products is land-filling. In the US, some states have implemented landfill bans to accompany e-waste laws to reach collection goals and ensure e-waste is funneled through the proper channels. The danger in landfilling e-waste is that hazardous materials can leach out into groundwater or run off and pollute nearby water bodies. To address this, the US e-waste recycling industry is growing and continuing to implement robust workplace and environmental standards. In 2011, US e-waste recycling added an estimated $20.6 billion to the US economy and created roughly 45,000 jobs."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,"Still, e-waste, that contain toxic materials like lead and cadmium, can pose risks for US e-waste workers when processed manually. For instance, when processing cathode ray tubes (CRTs), which are found in television and computer monitors, workers use handheld tools like hammers that expose them to hazardous materials. As a result, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) investigate e-waste recycling facilities for health and environmental compliance. At e-waste recycling facilities, manually dismantling and sorting e-waste is the most popular technique and shredding or other automated separation techniques are secondary."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,"One risk associated with manual dismantling is the potential for lead and cadmium contamination. Lead can disperse throughout e-waste recycling facilities covering surfaces, worker's uniforms, and areas outside the production floor, which can result in ingestion or inhalation of lead. Because of this, federal regulatory bodies like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) state that e-waste recycling facilities must provide uniforms, showers, and laundry services for workers."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,"When facilities don't meet these protocols, lead and cadmium exposures can leave the production floor with workers and enter their personal vehicles or homes, which can adversely affect the health of family members.Federal Prison Industries (FPI), also known as UNICOR, a government corporation that employs federal prison inmates, started an electronic-waste recycling program in 1994. UNICOR, a large government contractor, produced over $765 million in sales in 2005 and has accepted contracts for recycling e-waste since 1997. UNICOR has developed e-waste recycling operations in 10 federal prisons."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,"In addition, in 2009, UNICOR had 1,000 incarcerated individuals processing about 40 million pounds of e-waste. Since its inception, the e-waste recycling program has faced scrutiny regarding its lax safety enforcement, and has been subject to multiple health and safety investigations. Additionally, prisoners participating in this program are not protected under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and since they are not considered employees, they cannot formally organize and are not protected to speak out about unsafe working conditions."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,"This lack of legal protection leads workers to continue to operate in unsafe conditions, with fears of being fired or sent to another prison. In addition, OSHA is not permitted to conduct surprise inspections, which undermines their ability to investigate workplace safety violations. The UNICOR facility in Atwater was shut down in 2002 after an air quality test found lead and cadmium levels exceeding the standards set by OSHA. Between 2002 and 2005, a series of renovations and safety measures were taken to comply with safety standards, but the effectiveness of these efforts in reducing worker exposure to toxicants was debated."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,"In 2010, a report from the Inspector General revealed that UNICOR was in violation of e-waste recycling standards. The report found that UNICOR failed to provide protective workplace equipment or proper tools to dismantle electronic products, which resulted in staff and incarcerated individuals being exposed to lead and cadmium above permissible levels. Moreover, unspecified amounts of e-waste processed by UNICOR were also shipped overseas. Additionally, illegal storage and disposal of toxic waste, such as glass and electronic dust debris by UNICOR facilities, can lead to contaminated soil, air and water from wind and rainwater runoff."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,Health and safety negligence within the prison e-waste program may contribute to the accumulation of toxics in surrounding communities that are often made up of predominately low-income and minority residents.
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"Anywhere from 50 to 70% of e-waste collected in the US for recycling is exported to developing countries, which commonly ends up in the informal recycling sectors of Asia and West Africa. China receives the largest e-recycling volume, followed by India, Nigeria, and Ghana. Burning and dismantling e-waste is a main driver of atmospheric pollution and along with manual disassembly, is the primary workplace practice that results in exposure to hazardous materials. Oftentimes workers don't have the workplace protective equipment, like uniforms and face masks, necessary to shield them from the toxic fumes and dust."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"As the e-waste export chain generally ends in rural, unregulated, and technically illegal burning or dismantling sites, the workers are often subjected to extremely poor and hazardous conditions and are unable to unionize or speak out for better rights. High poverty levels correlate with illegal e-waste dumping sites, which is why most e-waste workers don't have the option to speak out and lose business or their jobs. In rural areas, contaminating compounds can accumulate in agricultural areas and be taken in by grazing animals."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"As the chemicals in question generally have a slow metabolic rate in animals, the compounds have a tendency to bioaccumulate in tissues and further contaminate humans through eggs, milk, and other edible products. In addition to human health hazards, contamination of water and soil can kill off entire populations, thus harming or destroying the local ecosystem. United States e-waste is primarily shipped to the following areas:China: In China, a variety of simple and complex e-waste disposal and disassembly processes take place."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"E-waste management practices include melting printed circuit boards to recover solder (surrounding plastics are burned off in the process), manual disassembly, and the use of acid to extract metals from complex mixtures. Due to the rudimentary methods of disposal and the number of years of e-waste processing, rural areas in China are beginning to experience contaminated surface water and soil that can hinder communities from further living on the land. In the case of Guiyu China, the region with the world's highest levels of cancer-causing dioxins, discharge water runs off into Lianjiang River."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"The Lianjiang River is considered to be a category 5 river; meaning that according to the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection, the water quality is not safe for human consumption or agricultural function and use. Some open air workshops in China use acid to recover valuable materials from e-waste and wastewater is transported to drainage pits, which can run off into other water bodies and severely impact freshwater ecosystems and impact agricultural sources. In some cases, groundwater is contaminated from the acids of shredding and separating workshops."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"In Guiyu, 80% of the children suffer from respiratory diseases because children typically work in or live near waste disposal sites. Children in China also can experience elevated blood levels, skin damage, headaches, chronic gastritis, and duodenal ulcers due to e-waste recycling pollutants. In Guiyu China, e-waste workers adhere to the industry despite risks, as can make an equivalent of $600 a month, which pays more than other occupations.Africa: Certain African countries where U.S. e-waste is shipped to, are known for the use of child labour at e-waste dismantling sites."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"In Ghana at the Agbogbloshie e-waste site, the employment of children of ages 5–18 has been documented. Young girls between the ages of 9-12 have been reported to primarily work as collectors and vendors, while the other children directly assist in burning and dismantling processes. The UN's ""Solving the E-Waste Problem"" initiative, which was set up in 2007 to tackle the world's growing crisis of electronic waste, warned that the global volume of electronic waste refuse is set to grow by 33% over the next four years."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"Much of it will be dumped in sites such as those in Agbogbloshie, increasing the risk of land contamination with lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic and flame retardants. Currently several organizations are working towards creating better conditions to handle e-waste. These organizations include Global Alliance for Health and Pollution GAHP; Green Advocacy Ghana, an environmental NGO based in Ghana, West Africa that aims at upholding and enhancing the sustainability and integrity of Ghana's environment, and Pure Earth.Latin America: Similar to Africa, Latin American countries associated with U.S. e-waste export contain child labor at management sites."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"In Nicaragua in particular, studies have documented that children working at the sites have highly elevated levels of PBDE in the children's serum. The reports document, however, that low-income communities that surround (but not work at) the site, have similar raised levels of PBDE and heavy metal dioxins. Malnourishment is common in children in these surrounding areas, and increases children's susceptibility of developing fatal diseases from exposure to these chemicals. E-waste management is slowly been taken into the political agenda of some countries in Latin America."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"However, in most countries the present destinies of obsolete electrical and electronic equipment as well as quantitative figures are unknown. Only Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, Argentina and Chile have particular baseline studies available so far. Specific e-waste legislation is in development in Costa Rica. All other countries of Latin America still lag behind in drafting a legal framework for e-waste management. While drafting such legislation the roles of both government and industry need to be clarified."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"Traditional models for solid waste management have assigned the tasks of collection and disposal of waste to public authorities; however, an EPR model requires an adequate assignation and re partition of responsibilities along the reverse supply chain. A participatory process in designing the legal framework is therefore a prerequisite of a successful later implementation.India: In India, over 1 million urban poor workers, often with low literacy skills and awareness of the potential hazards of e-waste exposure, manually dismantle e-waste. A great portion of Indian e-waste workers are children and women."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"High levels of dioxin compounds, which are linked to cancer and developmental defects, have been commonly found in the breast milk and placentas of women exposed to e-waste, which can reveal improper disposal and handling of electronic products. Specifically, there are various reports that the city of Delhi contains several e-waste management sites that use concentrated hydrochloric and nitric acids to extract gold and copper. Recycling of e-waste is a very lucrative business in India and dominated by informal actors. E-waste in India is often processed to recover valuable materials in small workshops using rudimentary recycling methods."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"For instance, during the manual dismantling process in informal dismantling and recycling sites, e-waste recyclers use chisels, hammers, and cutting torches to open solder connections and separate various types of metals and components. Researchers have collected ashes from two waste burning operations in New Delhi, India, at Ibrahimpur and Shashtri Park which contained high levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc.Thailand: In Thailand, e-waste can also lead to human health risks, such as cancer and human developmental difficulties, if it is not properly disposed of. Also, the incinerators they use to burn e-waste can cause headaches, coughing, and nausea."
 United States legislation , Federal ,"The United States Congress considers a number of electronic waste bills, including the National Computer Recycling Act introduced by Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA). Meanwhile, the main federal law governing solid waste is the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976. It covers only CRTs, though state regulations may differ. There are also separate laws concerning battery disposal. Several trade organizations including the Consumer Electronics Association are lobbying for the implementation of comprehensive federal laws."
 United States legislation , Federal ,"On March 25, 2009, the House Science and Technology Committee approved funding for research on reducing electronic waste and mitigating environmental impact, regarded by sponsor Ralph Hall (R-TX) as the first federal bill to address electronic waste directly. On July 6, 2009, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) proposed the ""Electronic Device Recycling Research and Development Act""."
 United States legislation , Federal ,"Bill S.1397 not only focuses on stopping illegal e-waste dumping, but it also calls for sustainable design of electronic equipment as well as offers funding for research and development of more sustainable designs, which would reduce the amount of toxic waste and increase the reuse and recycling of electronic products.During Earth Day, April 22, 2009, two bills were passed by the House of Representatives: H.R. 1580 Electronic Device Recycling Research and Development Act, introduced by Rep. Bart Gordon on March 18, 2009, and H.R. 957 Green Energy Education Act, introduced by Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX.) H.R."
 United States legislation , Federal ,"1580 requires the Administration of EPA to give merit-based grants to consortia of universities, government labs and private industries to conduct research with the purpose of finding new approaches to recycling and reduction of hazardous materials in electronic devices and to ""contribute to the professional development of scientists, engineers, and technicians in the field of electronic device manufacturing, design, refurnishing, and recycling."" The bill will require the recipients of the grants to report every two years to Congress about the progress of their research, gaps in the advancement, risks and regulatory barriers that might hinder their progress."
 United States legislation , Federal ,"The Congressional Budget Office estimates that to put the bill in effect ""would cost $10 million in 2010 and $80 million over the 2010-2014 period."" The other billed passed, H.R. 957, authorizes the Department of Energy in partnership with the National Science Foundation to provide grants to Institutions of higher education to promote education and training for Engineers and Architects ""in high energy and high-performance building design."""
 United States legislation , State ,"A policy of ""diversion from landfill"" has driven legislation in many states requiring higher and higher volumes of electronic waste to be collected and processed separate from the solid waste stream. In 2001, Arkansas enacted the Arkansas Computer and Electronic Solid Waste Management Act, which requires that state agencies manage and sell surplus computer equipment, establishes a computer and electronics recycling fund, and authorizes the Department of Environmental Quality to regulate and/or ban the disposal of computer and electronic equipment in Arkansas landfills.California was the first state to legislate around the issue of e-waste."
 United States legislation , State ,"It implemented a broader waste ban, with advance recovery fee funding in 2003. Electronic waste in California may neither be disposed of in a landfill nor be exported overseas. The 2003 Electronic Waste Recycling Act in California introduced an Electronic Waste Recycling Fee on all new monitors and televisions sold to cover the cost of recycling. The fee ranges from six to ten dollars. California went from only a handful of recyclers to over 60 within the state and over 600 collection sites."
 United States legislation , State ,"The amount of the fee depends on the size of the monitor; it was adjusted on July 1, 2005, in order to match the real cost of recycling. Cellphones are ""considered hazardous waste"" in California; many chemicals in cellphones leach from landfills into the groundwater system."
 United States legislation , State ,"In 2016, California approved AB 1419, a bill that aims to recycle panel glass, which is used in different types of electronics, locally instead of shipping it to other countries for disposal.Colorado legislation requires education programs that address its electronic waste problem.In 2004, Maine passed Maine Public Law 661, An Act to Protect Public Health and the Environment by Providing for a System of Shared Responsibility for the Safe Collection and Recycling of Electronic Waste."
 United States legislation , State ,"It necessitates that after 2006, computer manufacturers take responsibility for handling and recycling computer monitors, and pay the handling costs as well.Massachusetts was the first of the United States to make it illegal to dispose of CRTs in landfills in April 2000, most similar to the European disposal bans of the 1990s. Minnesota enacted a law making vendors responsible for the disposal of their branded electronics."
 United States legislation , State ,"Minnesota legislation also outlaws the dumping of cathode ray tubes in landfills.A law in the state of Washington took effect on January 1, 2009, requiring manufacturers of electronic goods to pay for recycling, and establishing a statewide network of collection points. The program, called E-Cycle Washington, is managed by the Department of Ecology and the Washington Materials Management & Financing Authority.On January 28, 2010, Arizona introduced HB 2614, a producer responsibility law modeled on the Oregon law that would have covered computers, laptops and TV monitors for recycling."
 United States legislation , State ,"However, it was withdrawn on February 15, 2010.As of 2008, 17 states have producer responsibility laws in some form. In all, 35 states have or are considering electronic waste recycling laws. The United States, along with a number of economically developed countries, ships the majority of its e-waste across seas to economically developing countries. The United Nations estimates between 10% and 50% of US e-waste is exported, the EPA estimates 25%, and the International Trade Commission estimates that the number is closer to 13%."
 United States legislation , State ,"Despite the numerous reports existing that document the waste's movement and existence, there lacks a coherent presentation of the data; largely due to the difficulty of accessing this information. Studies indicate that this gap exists primarily because of: undifferentiated trade codes, inconsistent methods of marking and classifying electronic products, inconsistent records kept in waste destination countries, and a lack of pressure holding companies accountable. Shipment of e-waste is not a partisan issue since local governments and private industries collaborate to manage non-functioning electronics."
 United States legislation , State ,"Research indicates that while mobile cell phones make up the overall greatest used electronics flows, TVs account for the largest flow of used electronics that are collected, and monitors have the highest export rates. The data records available show that the largest hubs for mobile phone deportation are Asia (Hong Kong, HKSAR) and the Caribbean and parts of Latin America (Guatemala, Paraguay, Panama, Peru, and Colombia). Larger electronics, such as TVs and monitors, have a higher likelihood of being exported to countries such as Mexico, Paraguay, Venezuela, and China."
 United States legislation , State ,"In addition to directly shipping waste overseas, many developed countries ship their e-waste to ""transport sites"", which then re-export the waste to surrounding countries or rural areas within their own country and make an extra profit. The largest international transit ports reside in Asia (Hong Kong, China, United Arab Emirates), which results in large quantities of waste ending up in smaller regions in the area. A prime example of this is the Chinese town of Guiyu, which has been denoted as the e-waste capital of the world."
 United States' export of e-waste , Export results ,"TVs: Color TVs comprise the group with highest export rates. Higher transportation rates by vessel or over land rather than by air.Mobile Phones: Largest export destinations: Latin America, Asia, South America. 73% of exports occur by air.Computers: Split into two categories: Desktop and Laptop. Laptops have much higher export rates due to lower weight and higher re-use value. Largest export destinations include Asia and Europe.Monitors: Split into two categories: CRT Monitors and Flat Panel Monitors."
 United States' export of e-waste , Re-export destination flows: Transport Sites ,"Completely accurate data concerning E-waste export flows is difficult to acquire and accumulate. There is a difference between simply used electronics that are exported and re-used in different countries and used electronics that are broken down as waste, but the United States lacks reports distinguishing the two. Used electronic often are shipped to a hub, where they are exported to lower-income areas that break down the devices, thus exposing the community to toxins."
 United States' export of e-waste , Re-export destination flows: Transport Sites ,"According to the records that track the initial export of used electronics, the major re-export destination hubs are: Lebanon, Argentina, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, Chile, Mexico, and China."
 United States' export of e-waste , International unregulated e-waste junkyards ,"E-waste is primarily shipped to large international hubs, such as Hong Kong. However, the majority of waste that is not recycled in those hubs is exported to rural areas where the waste is often improperly managed and becomes a severe contaminant. Unregulated junkyards and processing sites are unlicensed and almost always in violation of the law. This results in a lack of worker protection and rights, generally indicating a lack of awareness of the risks and hazards. Aside from general improper dismantling of the devices, open burnings and waste storage commonly take place."
 United States' export of e-waste , Improper dismantling and processing ,"Unregulated e-waste processing junkyards do not contain proper equipment or employ safety precautions. The primary dismantling process generally includes manual separation of the plastic sections from the rest of the device; the plastic sections are then shredded into small portions if not re-usable themselves. If these plastic fragments are not directly resold to larger companies, they are further broken down into a fine powder. When this process is poorly regulated, the powder is easily inhaled and absorbed into the soil, air, and surrounding vegetation."
 United States' export of e-waste , Improper dismantling and processing ,"The electronic devices are also stripped of their heavy metal components; this process in turn exposes workers to the raw elements of the metals. In addition to manually dismantling the devices, unregulated junkyards are ultimate disposal sites. Device disposal is mainly done by burning or smashing and burying the fragments; the aftermath of which has been documented to cause significant health problems in the surrounding area."
 United States' export of e-waste , Open burning ,"Open burnings are the most common means of 'disposing of' e-waste and occur primarily in rural areas with low incomes of developing countries. Communities use open burning for a variety of functions: For direct disposal, it takes the least amount of man-power and is the cheapest option. For precious metal extraction, it can be an effective method to extract certain valuable metals, such as gold. The combustion of burning e-waste results in ash that contains fine particulate matter; a measure of pollutants that has been linked to cardiovascular and pulmonary issues."
 United States' export of e-waste , Open burning ,"Additional health risks result from direct exposure to the toxic metals that release dioxins when burned and in addition to being inhaled, become embedded into the soil and plants in the surrounding area. The United Nations has done significant research into the growing issue of e-waste disposal and has documented that different communities are disproportionately affected by this issue: ""Such practices are closely related to poverty because uncontrolled waste dumps typically are located close to human settlements."
 United States' export of e-waste , Open burning ,"Since poor people neither have the economic means nor the technical knowledge, they also ignite their own wastes and thus create their own dioxin sources in their backyards. Therefore, women and children spending most time at home and living close to the burning areas are most exposed and at higher risk than others, e.g., urban and wealthier populations."""
 United States' export of e-waste , Waste storage for processing ,"In addition to open burning of electronic waste, rural communities are often used as storage locations. There exist varying stages in the life of an electronic device, and devices are stored or recycled depending on their specific stage. Storage facilities are almost always improperly constructed and regulated and thus generally result in the contamination of the soil and natural area surrounding the facility. Facilities that store cathode ray tubes (CRT) are particularly contaminated. Soil and dust samples collected at these locations indicate high levels of cadmium, zinc, and yttrium along with other heavy metal dioxins."
 United States' export of e-waste , Export responsibility ,"While the number of e-Waste recycling programs in the United States has increased, a portion of the waste continues to be shipped overseas. Recent research done by the Basel Action Network indicates that along with companies directly attempting to ship their waste overseas or into domestic landfills, certain questionable recycling programs themselves have contributed to the export numbers."
 United States' export of e-waste , Export responsibility ,"Questionable recycling companies act as brokers and ""cut costs by offloading dismantling and recycling to impoverished countries with lax labor laws, weak environmental regulations, and poor human rights track records."" Basel Action Network gained credibility after exposing electronic take-back programs that promoted their focus on sustainability by attaching tracking devices to the donated used electronic devices. About one third of the 200 geolocating tracking devices of BAN's primary investigation ended up overseas and finished their journey in rural Hong Kong.Before any legislation regulating e-waste was enacted, companies could directly export their e-waste to recycling or landfill hubs."
 United States' export of e-waste , Export responsibility ,"After regulation measures were introduced, the majority of exports are done through either certified e-waste handlers or uncertified handlers. The largest two competing certified handlers are e-stewards and Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI). ISRI represents some of the largest waste handlers because they are in trade with Asia and Africa. Although many recycling programs have increased in efficiency, loopholes still exist within the recycling program that allow companies to continue to export parts of the used electronic devices."
 United States' export of e-waste , Export responsibility ,"The majority of e-stewards recyclers implement no-export policies regarding the entire device, yet are still allowed to export raw plastics and metals in their simplest form. Due to this loophole, electronics are often labeled as raw plastics in order to pass customs, but in reality contain most of the components of the full electronic device; this nearly complete device then follows the general export process of being shipped and broken down at an e-waste hub, where the non-valuable components are then shipped to a junkyard to be broken down."
 United States' export of e-waste , Export responsibility ,"Additionally, reports show that recyclers with e-steward certification are able to export used electronics if the devices have undergone a test that proves they can still function. These devices similarly make up the shipments made to hubs for the extraction of valuable parts."
 Regulation of e-waste , International regulation ,"The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal of 1989 is an international treaty that stipulates guidelines of hazardous waste movement. In 2006, members of the Basel Convention began to discuss the addition of electronic waste management. Though 185 states including the European Union have ratified the treaty, the United States, one of the largest exporters of electronic waste, has not ratified it."
 Regulation of e-waste , International regulation ,"In terms of international regulatory bodies, in 2010 the United States EPA and United Nations University Solving the E-waste Problem Initiative (UNU-Step) began responding to the issue of electronic waste being exported to developing countries by tracking global flows of electronic waste."
 Regulation of e-waste , International regulation ,"In addition, in 2011 the United States EPA, Taiwanese EPA, and other international governments collaborated to form the International E-Waste Management Network (IEMN) to outline best practices on global electronic waste management and highlight next steps.In 2018, China issued the ""National Sword"" policy to regulate the number of recyclables that enter the country and prevent other countries from sending various solid waste materials, such as metals and plastics, into China. This has led countries to begin exporting their waste to other Asian countries, such as Vietnam and Thailand. Subsequently, these countries began to implement bans on waste as well."
 Regulation of e-waste , International regulation ,"In Vietnam, they have decided to stop allowing countries to send waste and cut a significant amount of their importations, as of 2018. In terms of electronic waste specifically, Thailand ruled in this same year that they would stop taking electronic waste from other countries and in 2021, they would stop accepting plastics.In 2021, China decided that they will not allow any type of solid waste into their country because of the overabundance of waste they've been receiving since the 1980s."
 Regulation of e-waste , Domestic regulation ,"To address consumer and manufacturer desires to properly handle e-waste in the absence of federal legislation, two US recycling standards were put in place: the e-stewards Standard for Responsible Recycling and Reuse of Electronic Equipment and the Responsible Recycling Practices (R2). Certified e-waste recyclers must comply with outlined best practices for handling e-waste. R2 was released in 2008 and revised in 2013 and is thought of as more practical to implement while also being fully consistent with the Basel Convention because it was organized by the EPA and other e-waste stakeholders. E-stewards and R2 recyclers are regulated by different protocols."
 Regulation of e-waste , Domestic regulation ,"In the area of exporting e-waste to developing countries for repairs or recycling, R2 recyclers can still export while e-stewards recyclers are prohibited. In the area of incinerating or land-filling e-waste, R2 recyclers are able to put toxic e-waste in landfills or incinerators if undefined 'circumstances beyond their control' take place while e-stewards are prohibited. In regards to workplace safety, R2 recyclers are permitted to determine which chemicals are toxic and the appropriate levels of exposure while e-stewards must test practices for their hazards, like breaking CRTs, removing mercury-containing devices, shredding and using solvents or thermal processes to break down e-waste."
 Regulation of e-waste , Domestic regulation ,"Another consumer and public health issue is prison e-waste recycling. In this area, R2 recyclers may use prison recycling operations at their discretion while e-steward recyclers are banned from doing so. Currently, there are more than 600 certified R2 recyclers in about 21 countries. The Basel Action Network (BAN) was a participant in the EPA's R2 recycling certification but broke away within two-and-a-half years. Because of the less stringent regulations on R2 recyclers, the Basel Action Network formed the e-stewards recycling certification to generate more robust e-waste regulations."
 Regulation of e-waste , Domestic regulation ,"Though most companies choose R2 or e-stewards certification, some companies like Sims Recycling Solutions are certified by both."
 Regulation of e-waste , Lobbying ,"Various organizations actively lobby government in order to address electronic waste issues. The major organizations are the Basel Action Network and the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. In 2002, a small activist group in California called Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) began lobbying, consisting largely of employees from PC and printer producers, like Hewlett-Packard. The coalition lobbied state legislators for stricter e-waste regulation which played a large role in the passing of the California Electronic Waste Recycling Act. In 2010, Empire Government Strategies helped write New York's E-Waste law that requires New York electronic companies to lead free e-waste recycling initiatives."
 Regulation of e-waste , Lobbying ,"Electronic Recyclers International, a small business that recycles electronic waste, began lobbying for more effective policies to combat e-waste in 2012.Since e-waste regulations began passing state by state, electronics manufacturers have both lobbied against e-waste regulations and been very cooperative with regulations once passed. In Washington, large companies fought against the passing of the 2006 Electronic Product Recycling Act. Yet since its passing, companies like Apple and Microsoft have instituted large scale takeback recycling initiatives, while also helping to fund the recycling and disposal of electronics."
 Regulation of e-waste , Lobbying ,"According to the EPA, consumers should dispose of electronics via recycling because,""Electronic products are made from valuable resources and materials, including metals, plastics, and glass, all of which require energy to mine and manufacture."
 Regulation of e-waste , Lobbying ,"Donating or recycling consumer electronics conserves our natural resources and avoids air and water pollution, as well as greenhouse gas emissions that are caused by manufacturing virgin materials."" Consumer recycling options include donating equipment directly to organizations in need, sending devices directly back to their original manufacturers, or getting components to a convenient recycler or refurbisher.However, recycling is not practical in all cases, and disposal is sometimes necessary."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Donation ,"The EPA maintains a list of electronic recycling and donation options for American consumers. The National Cristina Foundation, TechSoup (the Donate Hardware List), the Computer Takeback Campaign, and the National Technology Recycling Project provide resources for recycling. Local recycling sites that do not process waste products on site still contribute to electronic waste. A key issue with the donation of electronic waste by consumers is convenience."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Donation ,"Although there are state-by-state options, like ones listed above, a 2004 mail survey of California households found that a lack of nearby recycling options for e-waste was the number one reason for residents not recycling their e-waste. Pew Research Center survey information also found that in 2016, only approximately 48% of adult Americans said electronic waste was recycled in their community, in a sample size of 1,534 people over all 50 states."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Takeback ,"Corporations across the United States offer electronic takeback and recycling programs, offering low-cost to no-cost recycling. These centers accept and recycle electronics from the public, including mobile phones, laptop and desktop computers, digital cameras, and home and auto electronics. Companies such as Staples, Toshiba, and Gateway offer takeback programs that provide monetary incentives for recyclable or working technologies. The Manufacturers Recycling Management Co. was founded by Panasonic, Sharp Corporation, and Toshiba to manage electronic waste branded by these manufacturers, including 750 tons of TVs, computers, audio equipment, faxes, and components in its first four months."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Takeback ,"Office Depot lets customers obtain ""tech recycling"" boxes for e-waste if not eligible for the EcoNEW tech trade-in program. Best Buy offers a similar program for products purchased from Best Buy.Though helpful to both the environment and its citizens, there are some downsides to such programs. Many corporations offer services for a variety of electronic items, while their recycling centers are few in number. Recycling centers and takeback programs are available in many parts of the country, but the type and amount of equipment to be recycled tends to be limited."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Takeback ,"Some corporations, like Sony in its Take Back Recycling Program, provide recycling incentives but only accept up to five recycled items per day and only if they are that corporation's products. Sony also partners with the Waste Management Inc. Recycle America program and offers discounts and tradeup programs. Costco, which offers free shipping and handling for all recycled pieces of equipment, will only allow Costco club members to participate in their programs. Crutchfield Electronics offers its own gift cards in exchange for electronic waste, through Consumer Electronics Exchange."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Takeback ,"Hewlett-Packard has recycled over 750 million pounds of electronic waste globally, including hardware and print cartridges."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Reuse ,"There are several organizations that implement reuse programs, such as Digitunity and the World Computer Exchange. Digitunity is a non-profit organization that aims to collect used devices to donate it to those in need. The World Computer Exchange accepts computer donations of electronics that they give to low-income communities worldwide.Free Geek is a collectively run, non-profit organization based in Portland, Oregon. It aims to reuse or recycle used computer equipment that might otherwise become hazardous waste, and to make computer technology more accessible to those who lack financial means or technical knowledge. Also, New Neighborhood Development, Inc."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Reuse ,"is a recently started non-profit organization in Illinois, providing free electronic recycling to bring awareness to e-waste hazards. TechForward, SellCell.com, Flipsy, Gazelle, NextWorth, and Trademore are examples of companies that had accepted or will accept trade-ins of used devices as well as resale to consumers."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , A form of household hazardous waste ,"When feasible, e-waste should be recycled. But recycling such items is not always practical. When this happens, a household consumer should consider whether the e-waste is household hazardous waste, and if so (which it often is), take it to a proper place for disposal.

 Campaigns ,,BAN currently runs four campaigns focusing on decreasing the amount of toxins entering the environment and protecting underdeveloped countries from serving as a toxic dump of the developed countries of the world. These include:
 Campaigns , The e-Stewards Initiative ,"BAN's e-Stewards Electronics Stewardship campaign seeks to prevent toxic trade in hazardous electronic waste and includes a certification program for responsible electronics recycling known as the e-Stewards Initiative. It is available to electronics recyclers after they prove to have environmentally and socially responsible recycling techniques following audits conducted by accredited certifying bodies. Recyclers can become e-Steward certified after proving that they follow all national and international laws concerning electronic waste and its proper disposal, which includes bans on exporting, land dumping, incineration, and use of prison labor."
 Campaigns , The e-Stewards Initiative ,"When the e-Stewards initiative was initially started with the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, it was called ""The Electronics Recycler's Pledge of True Stewardship"". In the beginning, the initiative verified a recycler's participation through ""desk"" and paper audits only. The e-Stewards certification, however, has been updated and requires compliance verification by a third party auditor."
 Campaigns , Green ship recycling ,"BAN has teamed up with several other non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including Greenpeace to form the NGO Platform on Shipbreaking. The platform is focused on the responsible ship breaking disposal of end-of-life shipping vessels. The overall purpose of the platform is to stop the illegal dumping of toxic waste traveling from developed countries to undeveloped countries."
 Campaigns , Green ship recycling ,"The platform is focused on finding more sustainable, environmentally and socially responsible disposal techniques of disposing of such wastes, which can be achieved through a system where the polluter will be responsible for paying any fees associated with the legal and safe disposal of ships and other marine vessels. The NGO platform endorses the principles outlined in the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal."

 Circumstances , Financial difficulty ,"Atari, Inc. had been purchased by Warner Communications in 1976 for $28 million, and had seen its net worth grow to $2 billion by 1982. By this time, the company accounted for 80% of the video gaming market and was responsible for over half of its parent company's revenues, earning some 65–70% of their operating profits. By the last quarter of 1982, its growth in the following year was expected to be in the region of 50%. However, on December 7, 1982, the company reported that its earnings had only increased by 10–15%, rather than the predicted figure."
 Circumstances , Financial difficulty ,"The next day saw Warner Communications' share prices fall by a third, and the quarter ended with Warner's profits falling by 56%. In addition, Atari's CEO, Ray Kassar, was later investigated for possible insider trading charges as a result of selling some five thousand shares in Warner less than half an hour before reporting Atari's lower-than-expected earnings. Kassar was later cleared of any wrongdoing, although he was forced to resign his position the following July. Atari, Inc. would go on to lose $536 million in 1983, and was sold off by Warner Communications the following year."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"Atari's tendency to port arcade games for its home console had led to some of its most commercially successful games, including the port of its own coin-op Asteroids, as well as the licensed versions of Taito's Space Invaders and Namco's Pac-Man. When the latter game received its official port to the Atari 2600, Atari was confident that sales figures would be high, and manufactured 12 million cartridges—despite having sold only around 10 million Atari 2600 consoles."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"It was believed that the game would be successful enough not only to earn an estimated $500 million, but also to boost sales of the console itself by several million as gamers sought to play the home conversion."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"However, the finished product, released in March 1982, was critically panned for its poor gameplay, and although it became the console's best-selling game after shipping 7 million units, it left Atari with over 5 million unsold cartridges—a problem compounded by the high rate of customers returning the game for refunds.Further to the problems caused by Pac-Man's underwhelming sales, Atari also faced great difficulty as a result of its video game adaptation of the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"The game was a result of a deal between Warner Communications and the film's director Steven Spielberg, and was an attempt to follow the success of Atari's Raiders of the Lost Ark, another film-based game. It was later reported that Warner had paid $20–25 million for the rights, which was at the time a high figure for video game licensing."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"The task of developing the game fell on Howard Scott Warshaw, the programmer for Raiders, but due to lengthy delays in the licensing rights, Warshaw had only five weeks to make a full game to make sure Atari could sell it during the upcoming holiday period. The rushed development resulted in lackluster gameplay; the game was critically panned, and is now seen as one of the worst ever made. Atari manufactured 5 million cartridges for the game; however, upon its release in December 1982, only 1.5 million copies were sold, leaving Atari with half of the cartridges."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"Billboard writer Earl Paige reported that the large number of unsold E.T games, along with an increase in competition, prompted retailers to demand official return programs from video game manufacturers.The failures of these games were further compounded by Atari's business dealings from 1981. Confident in strong sales, the company had told its distributors to place their 1982 orders all at once. However, video game sales in 1982 had slowed, and distributors who had ordered en masse in expectation of high turnover were left to simply return large quantities of unsold stock to Atari."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"As a result, the company soon found itself in possession of several million essentially useless video game cartridges, which it would be entirely unable to sell. In September 1983, the Alamogordo Daily News of Alamogordo, New Mexico reported in a series of articles, that between 10 and 20 semi-trailer truckloads of Atari boxes, cartridges, and systems from an Atari storehouse in El Paso, Texas, were crushed and buried at the landfill within the city. It was Atari's first dealings with the landfill, which was chosen because no scavenging was allowed and its garbage was crushed and buried nightly."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"Atari's stated reason for the burial was that it was changing from Atari 2600 to Atari 5200 games, but this was later contradicted by a worker who claimed that this was not the case. Atari official Bruce Enten stated that Atari was mostly sending broken and returned material to the Alamogordo dump and that it was ""by-and-large inoperable stuff.""On September 27, 1983, the news service UPI reported that ""people watching the operation said it included cassettes [sic] of the popular video games E.T., Pac-Man, Ms."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"Pac-Man, the consoles used to convey the games to television screens and high-priced personal computers."" The news service Knight Ridder further reported on the looting of the dump on September 28 by local kids, stating ""kids in this town of 25,000 began robbing the Atari grave, coming up with cartridges of such games as E.T., Raiders of the Lost Ark, Defender, and Berzerk.""On September 28, 1983, The New York Times reported on the story of Atari's dumping in New Mexico."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"An Atari representative confirmed the story for the newspaper, stating that the discarded inventory came from Atari's plant in El Paso, which was being closed and converted to a recycling facility. The reports noted that the site was guarded to prevent reporters and the public from affirming the contents. The Times article did not specify the games being destroyed, but subsequent reports generally linked the story of the dumping to the well-known failure of E.T."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"Additionally, the headline ""City to Atari: 'E.T.' trash go home"" in one edition of the Alamogordo News seems to imply some of the cartridges were E.T., but then follows with a humorous interpretation of E.T. meaning ""Extra-territorial"" and never specifically mentions the game.Starting on September 29, 1983, a layer of concrete was poured on top of the crushed materials, a rare occurrence in waste disposal. An anonymous workman's stated reason for the concrete was: ""There are dead animals down there."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"We wouldn't want any children to get hurt digging in the dump."" Eventually, the city began to protest the large amount of dumping Atari was doing, with one commissioner stating that the area did not want to become ""an industrial waste dump for El Paso."" The local manager ordered an end to the dumping shortly afterwards. Due to Atari's unpopular dumping, Alamogordo later passed an Emergency Management Act and created the Emergency Management Task Force to limit the future flexibility of the garbage contractor to secure outside business for the landfill for monetary purposes."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"Alamogordo's then-mayor, Henry Pacelli, commented that, ""We do not want to see something like this happen again."""
 Burial , Cultural symbolism and speculation ,"All of these factors led to wide speculation that most of the 3.5 million unsold copies of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ultimately wound up in this landfill, crushed and encased in concrete. It had also been reported that prototypes for the proposed Atari Mindlink controller system were disposed of at the site, which only further fueled speculation, since Atari Museum owner Curt Vendel actually currently owns the Mindlink prototypes."
 Burial , Cultural symbolism and speculation ,"Writing for the Pacific Historical Review, John Wills speculated that location's place in the public psyche—its proximity to the sites of both the Trinity nuclear test and Roswell UFO incident—aided the popularity of the story.The conflicting information surrounding the burial led to the claim of it being an ""E.T. Dump"" being referred to as an urban legend, which in turn led to a degree of skepticism and doubt over the veracity of the dumping story itself, and the relevance of conflating the event with the later industry downturn. In October 2004, Howard Scott Warshaw, the programmer responsible for the E.T."
 Burial , Cultural symbolism and speculation ,"the Extra-Terrestrial game, expressed doubts at the time that the destruction of millions of copies of the game ever took place. Warshaw also believes that Atari's downfall was more a result of their business practices—including alleged block booking of poorly selling games with successful ones when dealing with distributors—than any specific failed games."
 Burial , Cultural symbolism and speculation ,"This latter view has been echoed by Travis Fahs of IGN, who believes that Atari's problems, including their huge surplus of unsold stock, arose from the company's overestimation of the sustainability of Atari 2600 sales, rather than being due to the individual quality of games being released.The incident has also become something of a cultural symbol representative of the video game crash of 1983, often cited as a cautionary tale about the hubris of poor business practices, despite suggestions that the burial allowed the company to write off the disposed-of material for tax relief purposes."
 Burial , In popular culture ,"The legacy of the burial has led it to be referenced in popular culture. The music video for the song ""When I Wake Up"" by Wintergreen depicts the band traveling to the landfill site and proceeding to dig up the abandoned cartridges; the video's director Keith Schofield had worked with video game-based music videos before. The novel Lucky Wander Boy by D.B. Weiss features a scene which takes place outside of Alamogordo, in which two of the characters discuss a parking lot which has been built over the site of the burial."
 Burial , In popular culture ,"The 2014 film Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie features a plot centered on the burial. The episode ""The Games Underfoot"" of the procedural drama Elementary featured a fictional version of the Atari (renamed ""Emeryvision"") video game burial. On May 28, 2013, the Alamogordo City Commission granted Fuel Industries, a Canadian entertainment company, six months of access to the landfill to film a documentary, Atari: Game Over, about the burial and to excavate the dump site."
 Burial , In popular culture ,"Xbox Entertainment Studios planned to air this documentary series as an exclusive to the Xbox One and Xbox 360 in 2014 as part of a multi-part documentary series being produced by Lightbox, a US/UK production company. Though the excavation was momentarily stalled due to a complaint by the New Mexico Environmental Protection Division Solid Waste Bureau citing potential hazards, the issues were resolved in early April 2014 to allow the excavation to proceed.Excavation started on April 26, 2014 as an open event to the public. E. T."
 Burial , In popular culture ,"the Extra-Terrestrial designer Howard Scott Warshaw, Ready Player One author Ernest Cline and film director Zak Penn attended the event as part of a documentary about the burial, as did local residents such as Armando Ortega, a city official who was reportedly one of the original children to raid the dump in 1983. Ortega stated that although he and his friends found dozens of quality games, they gave the E.T. cartridges away because the ""game sucked ... you couldn't finish it"". James Heller, the former Atari manager in charge of the original burial, was also on hand at the excavation."
 Burial , In popular culture ,"Heller revealed that he had originally ordered the site to be covered in concrete. Contrary to the urban legend that claims millions of cartridges were buried there, Heller stated that only 728,000 cartridges were buried.Remnants of E.T. and other Atari games were discovered in the early hours of the excavation, as reported by Microsoft's Larry Hryb."
 Burial , In popular culture ,"A team of archaeologists was present to examine and document the Atari material unearthed by excavation machinery: Andrew Reinhard (American School of Classical Studies at Athens), Richard Rothaus (Trefoil Cultural and Environmental), Bill Caraher (University of North Dakota), with support from video game historian Raiford Guins (Stony Brook University) and historian Bret Weber (University of North Dakota).Only about 1178 cartridges of the estimated 700,000 were removed from the burial, as the remaining materials were deeper than expected, which made them more difficult to access, according to Alamogordo mayor Susie Galea. The burial was refilled following this event."
 Burial , In popular culture ,"Joseph Lewandowski, who had worked to arrange the unearthing with the city, said that this was a one-time shot to recover materials from the site, as they do not expect the city to agree to a similar event again.The documentary Atari: Game Over, which features the burial site and its excavation, was released on November 20, 2014."
 Excavation , Curation and auction ,"Of the recovered materials, a fraction has been given to the New Mexico Museum of Space History for display, and another 100 to the documentary producers Lightbox and Fuel Entertainment. The Centre for Computing History in Cambridge, England also received some artifacts from the desert, which are on permanent display in the museum gallery. Galea believes the remaining cartridges can be sold by the city of Alamogordo through the Museum of Space History. She hopes that the sale of these games can help fund recognition of the burial site as a tourist attraction in the future."
 Excavation , Curation and auction ,"The City of Alamogordo approved the auction of the games in September 2014, to be sold through eBay and the Alamogordo Council website. As of September 2015, over $107,000 has been raised through the sales of about 880 unearthed cartridges, with one E.T. copy selling for more than $1,500. About 300 cartridges remain to be sold at a later date given the historical value of the cartridges.One of the E.T."
 Excavation , Curation and auction ,"cartridges that had been dug up was taken by the Smithsonian Institution for its records, calling the cartridge both representative of the burial site but also in terms of video games, how the cartridge represents ""the ongoing challenge of making a good film to a video game adaptation, the decline of Atari, the end of an era for video game manufacturing, and the video game cartridge life cycle"".

 Effect ,,"As a result, most retailers who sell rechargeable and other special batteries will take the old ones back for free recycling and safe disposal. The not-for-profit Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation (RBRC), used by most retailers, reclaims the metals within the old batteries to make new products such as batteries (mercury, cadmium, lead) and stainless steel (nickel)."

 History ,,"Metech History Timeline1875 The Wildberg Brothers facility, (aka Boliden Metech) was a metal reclamation plant which operated in San Francisco between 1907 and 1986. The site was approximately 5 1/2 acres in size. This facility was used as an antimony smelting plant which operated for an unknown duration beginning in 1875. 1907 The Site was purchased in 1907 by the Wildberg Brothers Company who operated a metal reclamation facility. The operations included milling, sampling, assaying of scrap materials, electrolytic deposition of silver, stripping of gold, and copper concentration. Gold, platinum, palladium, silver and copper were recovered as finished products."
 History ,,"1968 RMI traces its origin back to 1968 in Woonsocket, R.I. At that time, Refinemet focused on precious metals and tantalum recovery. Refinemet expanded into electronics recycling by “default” in the late ’70s and early ’80s because customers like AT&T, Burroughs, DEC and IBM had large pieces of equipment that they were retiring. 1980 Wildberg Brothers sold the facility to Refinemet International (RMI) in 1980. RMI primarily used the facility for precious metal scrap processing and refining."
 History ,,"1983 In 1983, shortly after expanding into processing end-of-life electronics, Boliden, a smelting and mining company based in Stockholm, Sweden, purchased RMI and renamed it Boliden Metech. It was during this time that Metech moved the East Coast operation from Woonsocket, RI to Mapleville, RI. Boliden used the San Francisco facility primarily for precious metal scrap processing but did not engage in refining operations at the Site. Operations conducted onsite consisted of material sorting, sampling, and assaying before the materials were containerized for shipment to Boliden facilities overseas for processing."
 History ,,"1986 Boliden discontinued all operations at the San Francisco site in May 1986. All buildings at the site, with the exception of Building 1, the Office Building, Building 2, the Laboratory; and Buildings 11-12, the Melt Shop, and Mechanical Processing area, were demolished and the business was moved to our current location in Gilroy, CA. Trelleborg, (the parent company of Boliden), later spun off the smelting operations under the name Boliden but retained Metech as a recycling and processing operation. In 2002 Viking Investment and Asset Management, based in Johannesburg, South Africa, bought Metech."
 History ,,"2005 In 2005 Metech was acquired by MTI Corp and relocated the corporate offices from Mapleville, RI to Worcester, Mass. The company designed a processing line to include shredders and downstream separation equipment. At this time, Metech also discontinued receiving precious-metals-containing hazardous waste and scaled back its other local precious metals refining businesses that were not adding value to the company’s focus on integrated electronics recycling. 2007 In 2007 Metech was acquired by “Centillion Environment and Recycling Ltd” of Singapore. In 2008 Centillion purchases “Guaranteed Recycling Xperts” (GRX) with locations in Denver, CO, Salt Lake City, UT and Omaha, NE."
 History ,,"2009 2009 Centillion merges Metech and GRX under the Metech Recycling banner. In 2012 Centillion was renamed Metech International 2016 In 2016 the Worcester facility was relocated once more to its current location in nearby Clinton, MA. At this time, corporate operations were permanently transferred to the Gilroy, CA facility. 2018 In 2018 Metech Recycling was purchased from METech International Pte by First America Management Group and taken Private. 2021 The METech Creedmoor location relocates to Roxboro, NC."

 History ,,"NextWorth was founded by David Chen, Andrew Walsh and Scott Richardson while they were students at Babson College. The company was selected for Babson College's 2005 Business Hatcheries program, which provides free resources to student-led startups. NextWorth Inc. began operations the following year. It was originally a service that helped businesses and non-profits prepare luxury items for online auctions in exchange for a 20-33 percent commission. In the spring of 2006, NextWorth changed its business model and services to focus on electronics trade-ins. In January 2007, NextWorth raised $1.5 million in its first round of funding."
 History ,,"NextWorth purchases used electronics and resells about 80-85 percent of them, while the remainder are sent to a network of partners for recycling. Many used iPhones are resold in countries where new ones are more expensive. Sellers can fill out an online form to describe the used products they want to sell, then get a quote through the website. After receiving the quote, sellers have thirty days to ship the product using a pre-paid shipping label provided by NextWorth."
 History ,,"The company wipes the device's memory and inspects the item before sending the seller reimbursement in 3–15 days depending on the payment method. If NextWorth appraises a product at a lower condition than the seller expected, they can get an explanation from NextWorth, challenge the quote, or reject it and get the product back.Sellers can also do trade-ins in-person and get reimbursed immediately at partnered retailers like Target. The Target trade-in program began as a pilot project in 2009, and expanded to 190 locations by 2010 and almost 1,500 stores by 2011."
 History ,,"Their partnership with Target ended in late 2016 when Target selected CExchange as their new partner. A similar partnership was in place with Circuit City before it went out of business in 2009. A company spokesperson stated in 2009 that the company was also partnered with 15 smaller retailers for in-person trade-ins. NextWorth sets its prices through an algorithm developed by MBA students and a professor at Babson College. Sellers can obtain better prices by reselling their electronics directly through services like eBay or Craigslist, but services like NextWorth are more convenient and have predictable pricing."
 History ,,"A CNET editor found most of the trade-in prices at NextWorth to be ""pretty fair"", though he was expecting higher prices for some items."
