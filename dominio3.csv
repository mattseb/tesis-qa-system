 Slaughterhouse waste ,,"Slaughterhouse waste is defined as animal body parts cut off in the preparation of carcasses for use as food. This waste can come from several sources, including slaughterhouses, restaurants, stores and farms. In the UK, slaughterhouse waste is classed as category 3 risk waste in the Animal By-Products Regulations, with the exception of condemned meat which is classed as category 2 risk."
 Slaughterhouse waste , By-products in pet food ,"The leftover pieces that come from the process of stripping meat from animals tends to get used for different purposes. One of them is to put these parts into pet food. Many large, well-known pet food brands use animal by-products as protein sources in their recipes. This can include animal feet, livers, lungs, heads, spleens, etc or an admixture in the form of meat and bone meal. These organs are usually not eaten by humans depending on culture, but are safe and nutritious for pets regardless. By-products can also include bad-looking pieces. They are always cooked (rendered) to kill pathogens."
 Slaughterhouse waste , By-products in pet food ,"Some pet food makers advertise the lack of by-products to appeal to buyers, a move criticized for contributing to food waste and reducing sustainability. Carmine, derived from crushed cochineal beetles, is a red or purple substance commonly used in food products. It is common in food products such as juice, candy, and yogurt. The presence of carmine in these products has been a source of controversy. One major source of controversy was the use of carmine in Starbucks frappuccinos. Carmine is an allergen according to the FDA. It takes about 70,000 female insects to produce a pound of dye."

 Classification of industrial waste and its treatment ,,"Hazardous waste, chemical waste, industrial solid waste and municipal solid waste are classifications of wastes used by governments in different countries. Sewage treatment plants can treat some industrial wastes, i.e. those consisting of conventional pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Industrial wastes containing toxic pollutants or high concentrations of other pollutants (such as ammonia) require specialized treatment systems. (See Industrial wastewater treatment).Industrial wastes can be classified on the basis of their characteristics: Waste in solid form, but some pollutants within are in liquid or fluid form, e.g."
 Classification of industrial waste and its treatment ,,"crockery industry or washing of minerals or coal Waste in dissolved and the pollutant is in liquid form, e.g. the dairy industry. Many factories and most power plants are located near bodies of water to obtain large amounts of water for manufacturing processes or for equipment cooling. In the US, electric power plants are the largest water users. Other industries using large amounts of water are pulp and paper mills, chemical plants, iron and steel mills, petroleum refineries, food processing plants and aluminum smelters."
 Classification of industrial waste and its treatment ,,"Many less-developed countries that are becoming industrialized do not yet have the resources or technology to dispose their wastes with minimal impacts on the environment. Both untreated and partially treated wastewater are commonly fed back into a near lying body of water. Metals, chemicals and sewage released into bodies of water directly affect marine ecosystems and the health of those who depend on the waters as food or drinking water sources. Toxins from the wastewater can kill off marine life or cause varying degrees of illness to those who consume these marine animals, depending on the contaminant."
 Classification of industrial waste and its treatment ,,"Metals and chemicals released into bodies of water affect the marine ecosystems.Wastewater containing nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) often causes eutrophication which can kill off existing life in water bodies. A Thailand study focusing on water pollution origins found that the highest concentrations of water contamination in the U-tapao river had a direct correlation to industrial wastewater discharges.Thermal pollution—discharges of water at elevated temperature after being used for cooling—can also lead to polluted water. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter food chain composition, reduce species biodiversity, and foster invasion by new thermophilic species."
 Environmental impact , Solid and hazardous waste ,"Solid waste, often called municipal solid waste, typically refers to material that is not hazardous. This category includes trash, rubbish and refuse; and may include materials such as construction debris and yard waste. Hazardous waste typically has specific definitions, due to the more careful and complex handling required of such wastes. Under US law, waste may be classified as hazardous based on certain characteristics: ignitability, reactivity, corrosivity and toxicity. Some types of hazardous waste are specifically listed in regulations."
 Environmental impact , Water pollution ,"One of the most devastating effects of industrial waste is water pollution. For many industrial processes, water is used which comes in contact with harmful chemicals. These chemicals may include organic compounds (such as solvents), metals, nutrients or radioactive material. If the wastewater is discharged without treatment, groundwater and surface water bodies—lakes, streams, rivers and coastal waters—can become polluted, with serious impacts on human health and the environment. Drinking water sources and irrigation water used for farming may be affected. The pollutants may degrade or destroy habitat for animals and plants."
 Environmental impact , Water pollution ,"In coastal areas, fish and other aquatic life can be contaminated by untreated waste; beaches and other recreational areas can be damaged or closed.: 273–309"
 Management , Thailand ,"In Thailand the roles in municipal solid waste (MSW) management and industrial waste management are organized by the Royal Thai Government, which is organized as central (national) government, regional government, and local government. Each government is responsible for different tasks. The central government is responsible for stimulating regulation, policies, and standards. The regional governments are responsible for coordinating the central and local governments. The local governments are responsible for waste management in their governed area."
 Management , Thailand ,"However, the local governments do not dispose of the waste by themselves but instead hire private companies that have been granted the right from the Pollution Control Department (PCD) in Thailand. The main companies are Bangpoo Industrial Waste Management Center, General Environmental Conservation Public Company Limited (GENCO), SGS Thailand, Waste Management Siam LTD (WMS), and Better World Green Public Company Limited (BWG). These companies are responsible for the waste they have received from their customers before releasing it to the environment, burying it."
 Management , United States ,"The 1976 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) provides for federal regulation of industrial, household, and manufacturing solid and hazardous wastes in the United States. RCRA aims to conserve natural resources and energy, protect human health, eliminate or reduce waste, and to clean up waste when needed. RCRA first began as an amendment to the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965, and in 1984, Congress passed the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) which strengthened RCRA by: Eliminating land disposal—land disposal means placing waste on or in land (e.g."
 Management , United States ,"injection wells, landfills, etc.), and the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) program (under HSWA) forbids untreated hazardous waste from land disposals, and requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set specific treatment standards that must be met before hazardous waste can be subject to land disposals. The LDR program also has a dilution prohibition, which asserts that hazardous waste cannot be diluted down by the handler as a means to avoid satisfying the treatment."
 Management , United States ,"Waste minimization—the goal of waste minimization is to make sure that the amount of hazardous waste that is produced, and its toxicity levels, is as diminished as possible, and the EPA does this through source reduction and recycling. Source reduction (or pollution prevention (P2)) trims production of hazardous wastes right at its source, and is the EPA's first step in material management with recycling being second. Amplifying the EPA's authority regarding corrective action—corrective action is when treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) must oblige with inquiring hazardous releases into ground and surface water, soil, and air, and clearing it up."
 Management , United States ,"Under the HSWA, the EPA can necessitate corrective action at permitted and non-permitted TSDFs.Furthermore, the EPA uses Superfund to find sites of contamination, identify the parties responsible, and in the occurrences where said parties are not known or able to, the program funds cleanups. Superfund also works on figuring out and applying final remedies for cleanups."
 Management , United States ,"The Superfund process is to: 1) collect necessary information (known as the Remedial Investigation (RI) phase); 2) assess alternatives to deal with any potential risks to the environmental and human health (known as the Feasibility Study (FS) stage); 3) determine the most suitable remedies that could lower the risks to more adequate levels. Some sites are so contaminated because of past waste disposals that it takes decades to clean them up, or bring the contamination down to acceptable levels, thus requiring long-term management over those sites."
 Management , United States ,"Hence, sometimes figuring out a final remedy is not possible, and so, the EPA has developed the Adaptive Management plan.The EPA has issued national regulations regarding the handling, treatment and disposal of wastes. EPA has authorized individual state environmental agencies to implement and enforce the RCRA regulations through approved waste management programs.State compliance is monitored by EPA inspections. In the case that waste management guideline standards are not met, action against the site will be taken. Compliance errors may be corrected by enforced cleanup directly by the site responsible for the waste or by a third party hired by that site."
 Management , United States ,"Prior to the enactment of the Clean Water Act (1972) and RCRA, open dumping or releasing wastewater into nearby bodies of water were common waste disposal methods. The negative effects on human health and environmental health led to the need for such regulations. The RCRA framework provides specified subsections defining nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials and how each should be properly managed and disposed of. Guidelines for the disposal of nonhazardous solid waste includes the banning of open dumping."
 Management , United States ,"Hazardous waste is monitored in a ""cradle to grave"" fashion; each step in the process of waste generation, transport and disposal is tracked. The EPA now manages 2.96 million tons of solid, hazardous and industrial waste. Since establishment, the RCRA program has undergone reforms as inefficiencies arise and as waste management processes evolve.The 1972 Clean Water Act is a broad legislative mandate to protect surface waters (rivers, lakes and coastal water bodies). A 1948 law had authorized research and development of voluntary water standards, and had provided limited financing for state and local government efforts."
 Management , United States ,"The 1972 law prohibited, for the first time, uncontrolled discharges of industrial waste, as well as municipal sewage, into waters of the United States. EPA was required to develop national standards for industrial facilities and standards for municipal sewage treatment plants. States were required to develop water quality standards for individual water bodies. Enforcement is mainly delegated to state agencies. Major amendments to the law were passed in 1977 and 1987."

 Laboratory chemical waste in the US ,,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prohibits disposing of certain materials down drains. Therefore, when hazardous chemical waste is generated in a laboratory setting, it is usually stored on-site in an appropriate waste carboy where it is later collected and disposed of by a specialist contractor in order to meet safety, health, and legislative requirements. Many universities' Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) divisions/departments serve this collection and oversight role.Organic solvents and other organic waste is typically incinerated. Some chemical wastes are recycled, such as waste elemental mercury."
 Laboratory chemical waste in the US , Packaging ,"During packaging, chemical liquid waste containers are filled to no further than 75% capacity to allow for vapor expansion and to reduce potential spills which can occur from transporting or moving overfilled containers. Containers for chemical liquid waste are typically constructed from materials compatible with the hazardous waste being stored, such as inert materials like polypropylene (PP) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). These containers are also constructed of mechanically robust materials in order to minimize leakage during storage or transit. In addition to the general packaging requirements mentioned above, precipitates, solids, and other non-fluid wastes are typically stored separately from liquid waste."
 Laboratory chemical waste in the US , Packaging ,Chemically contaminated glassware is disposed of separately from other chemical waste in containers that cannot be punctured by broken glass.
 Laboratory chemical waste in the US , Labelling ,Containers are labelled with the group name from the chemical waste category and an itemized list of the contents. All chemicals or materials contaminated by chemicals pose a significant hazard. All waste must be appropriately packaged.
 Laboratory chemical waste in the US , Storage ,"Chemical waste containers are kept closed to prevent spillage, except for when waste is being added. Suitable containers are labeled in order to inform disposal specialists of the contents, as well as to prevent addition of incompatible chemicals. Liquid waste is stored in containers with secure screw-top or similar lids that cannot be easily dislodged in transit. Solid waste is stored in various sturdy, chemically inert containers, such as large sealed buckets or thick plastic bags."
 Laboratory chemical waste in the US , Storage ,"A secondary containment (e.g., flammable cabinet or large plastic bin, etc.) is used to capture spills and leaks from the primary container and segregate incompatible hazardous wastes, such as acids and bases."
 Laboratory chemical waste in the US , Chemical compatibility guidelines ,"Many chemicals react adversely when combined. Incompatible chemicals are therefore stored in separate areas of laboratories.Acids are separated from alkalis, metals, cyanides, sulfides, azides, phosphides, and oxidizers, as when acids combine with these types of compounds, violent exothermic reactions can occur. In addition, some of these reactions produce flammable gases, which, combined with the heat produced, may cause explosions. In the case of cyanides, sulfides, azides, phosphides, etc. Toxic gases are also produced."
 Laboratory chemical waste in the US , Chemical compatibility guidelines ,"Oxidizers are separated from acids, organic materials, metals, reducing agents, and ammonia, as when oxidizers combine with these types of compounds, flammable and sometimes toxic compounds can be created. Oxidizers also increase the likelihood that any flammable material present will ignite, seen most readily in research laboratories with improper storage of organic solvents."
 Environmental pollution , Textile industry ,"The textile industry is one of the largest polluters in the globalized world of mostly free market dominated socioeconomic systems. Chemically polluted textile wastewater degrades the quality of the soil and water. The pollution comes from the type of conduct of chemical treatments used e.g., in pretreatment, dyeing, printing, and finishing operations that many or most market-driven companies use despite ""eco-friendly alternatives"". Textile industry wastewater is considered to be one the largest polluters of water and soil ecosystems, causing ""carcinogenic, mutagenic, genotoxic, cytotoxic and allergenic threats to living organisms""."
 Environmental pollution , Textile industry ,"The textile industry uses over 8000 chemicals in its supply chain, also polluting the environment with large amounts of microplastics and has been identified in one review as the industry sector producing the largest amount of pollution.A campaign of big clothing brands like Nike, Adidas and Puma to voluntarily reform their manufacturing supply chains to commit to achieving zero discharges of hazardous chemicals by 2020 (global goal) appears to have failed. The textile industry also creates a lot of pollution that leads to externalities which can cause large economic problems."
 Environmental pollution , Textile industry ,The problem usually occurs when there is no division of ownership rights. This means that the problem of pollution is largely caused because of incomplete information about which company pollutes and at what scale the damage was caused by the pollution.
 Environmental pollution , Planetary boundary ,"A study by ""Scienmag"" defines a 'planetary boundary' for novel entities such as plastic and chemical pollution. The study reported that the boundary has been crossed. Chemicals waste may fall under regulations such as COSHH in the United Kingdom or the Clean Water Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the United States. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), as well as state and local regulations, also regulate chemical use and disposal."
 Regulation of chemical waste , Chemical waste in Canadian aquaculture ,"Chemical waste in oceans is becoming a major issue for marine life. There have been many studies conducted to try and prove the effects of chemicals in oceans. In Canada, many of the studies concentrated on the Atlantic provinces, where fishing and aquaculture are an important part of the economy. In New Brunswick, a study was done on sea urchins in an attempt to identify the effects of toxic and chemical waste on life beneath the ocean, specifically the waste from salmon farms. Sea urchins were used to check the levels of metals in the environment."
 Regulation of chemical waste , Chemical waste in Canadian aquaculture ,"Green sea urchins have been used as they are widely distributed, abundant in many locations, and easily accessible. By investigating the concentrations of metals in the green sea urchins, the impacts of chemicals from salmon aquaculture activity could be assessed and detected. Samples were taken at 25-meter intervals along a transect in the direction of the main tidal flow. The study found that there were impacts to at least 75 meters based on the intestine metal concentrations."

 Ash handling processes ,,"In a conventional water impounded hopper (WIH) system, the clinker lumps get crushed to small sizes by clinker grinders mounted under water and fall down into a trough from where a water ejector takes them out to a sump. From there it is pumped out by suitable rotary pumps. In another arrangement a continuous link chain scrapes out the clinkers from under water and feeds them to clinker grinders outside the bottom ash hopper. More modern systems adopt a continuous removal philosophy."
 Ash handling processes ,,"Essentially, a heavy duty chain conveyor submerged in a water bath below the furnace which quenches hot ash as it falls from the combustion chamber and removes the wet ash continuously up to a de-watering slope before onward discharge into mechanical conveyors or directly to storage silos. Modern municipal waste incinerators reduce the production of dioxins by incinerating at 850 to 950 degrees Celsius for at least two seconds, forming incinerator bottom ash as byproduct. In United States facilities, the ash waste is typically pumped to ash ponds, the most common disposal method."
 Ash handling processes ,,"Some power plants operate a dry disposal system with landfills. In the United States, coal ash is a major component of the nation's industrial waste stream. In 2017, 38.2 million short tons (34.7×10^6 t) of fly ash, and 9.7 million short tons (8.8×10^6 t) of bottom ash were generated. Coal contains trace levels of arsenic, barium, beryllium, boron, cadmium, chromium, thallium, selenium, molybdenum and mercury, many of which are highly toxic to humans and other life. Coal ash, a product of combustion, concentrates these elements and can contaminate groundwater or surface waters if there are leaks from an ash pond.Most U.S."
 Ash handling processes ,,"power plants do not use geomembranes, leachate collection systems, or other flow controls often found in municipal solid waste landfills. Following a 2008 failure that caused the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began developing regulations that would apply to all ash ponds in the U.S. EPA published its ""Part A"" final rule for Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) on August 28, 2020, requiring all unlined ash ponds to retrofit with liners or close by April 11, 2021."
 Ash handling processes ,,"Some facilities may apply to obtain additional time—up to 2028—to find alternatives for managing ash wastes before closing their surface impoundments. EPA published its """"CCR Part B"" rule on November 12, 2020, which allows certain facilities to use an alternative liner, based on a demonstration that human health and the environment will not be affected. Further litigation on the CCR regulation is pending as of 2021."
 Environmental impacts , Ash recycling ,"Bottom ash can be extracted, cooled and conveyed using dry ash handling technology. When left dry the ash can be used to make concrete, bricks and other useful materials. There are also several environmental benefits.Bottom ash may be used as raw alternative material, replacing earth or sand or aggregates, for example in road construction and in cement kilns (clinker production). A noticeable other use is as growing medium in horticulture (usually after sieving). In the United Kingdom it is known as furnace bottom ash (FBA), to distinguish it from incinerator bottom ash (IBA), the non-combustible elements remaining after incineration."
 Environmental impacts , Ash recycling ,A pioneer use of bottom ash was in the production of concrete blocks used to construct many high-rise flats in London in the 1960s.

 Composition ,,"The composition of municipal solid waste varies greatly from municipality to municipality, and it changes significantly with time. In municipalities which have a well-developed waste recycling system, the waste stream mainly consists of intractable wastes such as plastic film and non-recyclable packaging materials. At the start of the 20th century, the majority of domestic waste (53%) in the UK consisted of coal ash from open fires. In developed areas without significant recycling activity it predominantly includes food wastes, market wastes, yard wastes, plastic containers and product packaging materials, and other miscellaneous solid wastes from residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial sources."
 Composition ,,"Most definitions of municipal solid waste do not include industrial wastes, agricultural wastes, medical waste, radioactive waste or sewage sludge. Waste collection is performed by the municipality within a given area. The term residual waste relates to waste left from household sources containing materials that have not been separated out or sent for processing."
 Composition ,,"Waste can be classified in several ways, but the following list represents a typical classification: Biodegradable waste: food and kitchen waste, green waste, paper (most can be recycled, although some difficult to compost plant material may be excluded) Recyclable materials: paper, cardboard, glass, bottles, jars, tin cans, aluminum cans, aluminium foil, metals, certain plastics, textiles, clothing, tires, batteries, etc. Inert waste: construction and demolition waste, dirt, rocks, debris Electrical and electronic waste (WEEE) – ⁣electrical appliances, light bulbs, washing machines, TVs, computers, screens, mobile phones, alarm clocks, watches, etc."
 Composition ,,"Composite wastes: waste clothing, Tetra Pack food and drink cartons, waste plastics such as toys and plastic garden furniture Hazardous waste including most paints, chemicals, tires, batteries, light bulbs, electrical appliances, fluorescent lamps, aerosol spray cans, and fertilizers Toxic waste including pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides Biomedical waste, expired pharmaceutical drugs, etc.For example, typical municipal solid waste in China is composed of 55.9% food residue, 8.5% paper, 11.2% plastics, 3.2% textiles, 2.9% wood waste, 0.8% rubber, and 18.4% non-combustibles. The municipal solid waste industry has four components: recycling, composting, disposal, and waste-to-energy via incineration."
 Composition ,,"There is no single approach that can be applied to the management of all waste streams, therefore the Environmental Protection Agency, a U.S. federal government agency, developed a hierarchy ranking strategy for municipal solid waste. The waste management hierarchy is made up of four levels ordered from most preferred to least preferred methods based on their environmental soundness: Source reduction and reuse; recycling or composting; energy recovery; treatment and disposal."
 Components of solid waste management , Collection ,"The functional element of collection includes not only the gathering of solid waste and recyclable materials, but also the transport of these materials, after collection, to the location where the collection vehicle is emptied. This location may be a materials processing facility, a transfer station or a landfill disposal site."
 Components of solid waste management ," Waste handling and separation, storage and processing at the source ",Waste handling and separation involves activities associated with waste management until the waste is placed in storage containers for collection. Handling also encompasses the movement of loaded containers to the point of collection. Separating different types of waste components is an important step in the handling and storage of solid waste at the source of collection.
 Components of solid waste management , Segregation and processing and transformation of solid wastes ,"The types of means and facilities that are now used for the recovery of waste materials that have been separated at the source include curbside (US) / kerbside (UK) collection, drop-off and buy-back centres. The separation and processing of wastes that have been separated at the source and the separation of commingled wastes usually occur at a materials recovery facility, transfer stations, combustion facilities and treatment plants."
 Components of solid waste management , Transfer and transport ,"This element involves two main steps. First, the waste is transferred from a smaller collection vehicle to larger transport equipment. The waste is then transported, usually over long distances, to a processing or disposal site."
 Components of solid waste management , Disposal ,"Today, the disposal of wastes by land filling or land spreading is the ultimate fate of all solid wastes, whether they are residential wastes collected and transported directly to a landfill site, residual materials from materials recovery facilities (MRFs), residue from the combustion of solid waste, compost, or other substances from various solid waste processing facilities. A modern sanitary landfill is not a dump; it is an engineered facility used for disposing of solid wastes on land without creating nuisances or hazards to public health or safety, such as the problems of insects and the contamination of groundwater."
 Components of solid waste management , Reusing ,"In recent years, environmental organizations, such as Freegle or The Freecycle Network, have been gaining popularity for their online reuse networks. These networks provide a worldwide online registry of unwanted items that would otherwise be thrown away, for individuals and nonprofits to reuse or recycle. Therefore, this free Internet-based service reduces landfill pollution and promotes the gift economy."
 Components of solid waste management , Landfills ,"Landfills are created by land dumping. Land dumping methods vary, most commonly it involves the mass dumping of waste into a designated area, usually a hole or sidehill. After the waste is dumped, it is then compacted by large machines. When the dumping cell is full, it is then ""sealed"" with a plastic sheet and covered in several feet of dirt. This is the primary method of dumping in the United States because of the low cost and abundance of unused land in North America."
 Components of solid waste management , Landfills ,"Landfills are regulated in the US by the Environmental Protection Agency, which enforces standards provided in the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, such as requiring liners and groundwater monitoring. This is because landfills pose the threat of pollution and can contaminate groundwater. The signs of pollution are effectively masked by disposal companies, and it is often hard to see any evidence. Usually, landfills are surrounded by large walls or fences hiding the mounds of debris. Large amounts of chemical odor eliminating agent are sprayed in the air surrounding landfills to hide the evidence of the rotting waste inside the plant."
 Components of solid waste management , Energy generation ,"Municipal solid waste can be used to generate energy because of the lipid content present within it. A lot of MSW products can be converted into clean energy if the lipid content can be accessed and utilized. Several technologies have been developed that make the processing of MSW for energy generation cleaner and more economical than ever before, including landfill gas capture, combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and plasma arc gasification.While older waste incineration plants emitted a lot of pollutants, recent regulatory changes and new technologies have significantly reduced this concern."
 Components of solid waste management , Energy generation ,"United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations in 1995 and 2000 under the Clean Air Act have succeeded in reducing emissions of dioxins from waste-to-energy facilities by more than 99 percent below 1990 levels, while mercury emissions have been reduced by over 90 percent. The EPA noted these improvements in 2003, citing waste-to-energy as a power source ""with less environmental impact than almost any other source of electricity""."

 Types of waste ,,"C&D Materials, construction and demolition materials, are materials used in and harvested from new building and civilengineer structures. Much building waste is made up of materials such as bricks, concrete and wood damaged or unused during construction. Observational research has shown that this can be as high as 10 to 15% of the materials that go into a building, a much higher percentage than the 2.5-5% usually assumed by quantity surveyors and the construction industry."
 Types of waste ,,"Since considerable variability exists between construction sites, there is much opportunity for reducing this waste.There has been a massive increase in construction and demolition waste created over the last 30 years in the United States. In 1990, 135 million tons of construction and demolition debris by weight were created and had risen to 600 million tons by the year 2018. This is a 300% increase, but it is important to note that since 2015 the EPA has kept records of how the waste is disposed of."
 Types of waste ,,"In 2018, 600 million tons of waste was created due to construction and demolition, and 143 million tons of it resides in landfills. This means that about 76% of waste is now retained and repurposed in the industry, but there is still more waste being exported to landfills than the entire amount of waste created in 1990. This unsustainable consumption of raw materials creates increasing business risks. This includes higher material costs or disruptions in the supply chains."
 Types of waste ,,"In 2010, the EPA created the Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) Program Strategic Plan which marked a strategic shift by the EPA to move emphasis from broad resource recovery initiative to sustainable materials management. Since material management regulations largely exist at a state and local level, this is no real standard practice across the nation for responsible waste mitigation strategies for construction materials. The EPA aims to increase access to collection, processing, and recycling infrastructure in order to meet this issue head on."
 Types of waste , Main causes of waste ,"Construction waste can be categorized as follows: Design, Handling, Worker, Management, Site condition, Procurement and External. These categories were derived from data collected from past research concerning the frequency of different types of waste noted during each type of these activities. Examples of this type of waste are as follows:"
 Types of waste , Steel reinforcement ,"Steel is used as reinforcement and structural integrity in the vast majority of construction projects. The main reasons steel is wasted on a site is due to irresponsible beam cutting and fabrication issues. The worst sites usually end up being the ones that do not have adequate design details and standards, which can result in waste due to short ends of bars being discarded due to improper planning of cuts. Many companies now choose to purchase preassembled steel reinforcement pieces. This reduces waste by outsourcing the bar cutting to companies that prioritize responsible material use."
 Types of waste , Premixed concrete ,"Premixed concrete has one of the lowest waste indices when compared to other building materials. Many site managers site the difficulties controlling concrete delivery amounts as a major issue in accurately quantifying concrete needed for a site. The deviations from actually constructed concrete slabs and beams and the design amounts necessary were found to be 5.4% and 2.7% larger than expected, respectively, when comparing the data from 30 Brazilian sites. Many of these issues were attributed to inadequate form layout or lack of precision in excavation for foundation piles."
 Types of waste , Premixed concrete ,"Additionally, site managers know that additional concrete may be needed, and they will often order excess material to not interrupt the concrete pouring."
 Types of waste , Pipes and wires ,"It is often difficult to plan and keep track of all the pipes and wires on a site as they are used in so many different areas of a project, especially when electrical and plumbing services are routinely subcontracted. Many issues of waste arise in this area of the construction process because of poorly designed details and irresponsible cutting of pipes and wires leaving short, wasted pipes and wires."
 Types of waste , Improper material storage ,The second leading cause of construction waste production is inproper material storage. Exposure to the elements and miss handling by persons are due to human error. Part of this human error can lead to illegal dumping and illegal transportation volume of waste from a jobsite.
" Recycling, disposal and environmental impact ", Recycling and reuse of material ,"Most guidelines on C&D waste management follows the waste managing hierarchy framework. This framework involves a set of alternatives for dealing with waste arranged in descending order of preference. The waste hierarchy is a nationally and internationally accepted concept used to priorities and guide efforts to manage waste. Under the idea of Waste Hierarchy, there is the concept of the ""3R's,"" often known as ""reduce, reuse, recycle."" Certain countries adopt different numbers of ""R's."" The European Union, for example, puts principal to the ""4R"" system which includes ""Recovery"" in order to reduce waste of materials."
" Recycling, disposal and environmental impact ", Recycling and reuse of material ,"Alternatives include prevention, energy recovery, (treatment) and disposal. It is possible to recycle many elements of construction waste. Often roll-off containers are used to transport the waste. Rubble can be crushed and reused in construction projects. Waste wood can also be recovered and recycled."
" Recycling, disposal and environmental impact ", Landfilling ,"Some certain components of construction waste such as plasterboard are hazardous once landfilled. Plasterboard is broken down in landfill conditions releasing hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas. Once broken down, Plasterboard poses a threat for increases Arsenic concentration Levels in its toxic inorganic form. The traditional disposal way for construction waste is to send it to landfill sites. In the U.S., federal regulations now require groundwater monitoring, waste screening, and operator training, due to the environmental impact of waste in C&D landfills (CFR 1996)."
" Recycling, disposal and environmental impact ", Landfilling ,"Sending the waste directly to a landfill causes many problems: Waste of natural resources Increases construction cost, especially the transportation process Occupies a large area of land Reduces soil quality Causes water pollution (Leachate) Causes air pollution Produces security risks etc."
" Recycling, disposal and environmental impact ", Incineration and health risks ,"Where recycling is not an option, the disposal of construction waste and hazardous materials must be carried out according to legislation of relevant councils and regulatory bodies. The penalties for improper disposal of construction waste and hazardous waste, including asbestos, can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars for businesses and individuals. Waste-to-energy facilities burn more than 13% of solid municipal waste. The toxic fumes emitted by WTE plants can contain harmful chemicals such as mercury and other heavy metals, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and dioxins. Dioxin was used as a waste oil in Times Beach, Missouri."
" Recycling, disposal and environmental impact ", Incineration and health risks ,"Days after the chemicals were introduced to the community animals began dying. By the time the EPA deemed dioxins to be highly toxic in the 1980s, the CDC recommended the town be abandoned entirely due to contaminated waste products in the area. By 1985, the entire population of Times Beach had been relocated, prompting Missouri to build a new incinerator on the contaminated land. They continued to burn 265,000 tons of dioxin-contaminated waste until 1997. Dioxins are a family of chemicals produced as a byproduct during the manufacturing of many pesticides and construction materials like carpeting and PVC."
" Recycling, disposal and environmental impact ", Incineration and health risks ,"These chemicals exist in the environment attached to soil or dust particles that are invisible to the naked eye. Dioxins break down slowly. It still threatens public health at low levels. Since industry has mostly stopped producing dioxins, one of the largest contributors releasing harmful dioxins left in the United States is waste incineration. Dioxins have been proven to cause cancer, reproductive and developmental issues, and immune system damage. Rates of cancer such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft tissue sarcoma rise significantly the closer one lives to the pollutants' source."
 Management strategies , Waste management fees ,"Waste management fees, under the 'polluter pays principle', can help mitigate levels of construction waste. There is very little information on determining a waste management fee for construction waste created. Many models for this have been created in the past, but they are subjective and flawed. In 2019, a study method was proposed to optimize the construction waste management fee. The new model expands on previous ones by considering life-cycle costs of construction waste and weighs it against the willingness to improve construction waste management. The study was based out of China."
 Management strategies , Waste management fees ,"China has a large waste management issue, and their landfills are mostly filled in urban areas. The results of the study indicated different waste management fees for metal, wood, and masonry waste as $9.30, $5.92, and $4.25, respectively. The cost of waste management per square meter, or just under 11 square feet, on average was found to be $0.12. This type of waste management system requires top-down legislative action. It is not a choice the contractor has the luxury of making on his/her own."
 Management strategies , Europe ,"In the European Union (EU), there is now significant emphasis on recycling building materials and adopting a cradle-to-grave ideology when it comes to building design, construction, and demolition. Their suggestions are much clearer and easier at the local or regional level, depending on government structure. In the 2016 EU Construction & Demolition Waste Management Protocol, they emphasize the benefits beyond financial gains for recycling such as job creation and reduced landfilling."
 Management strategies , Europe ,They also emphasize the consideration of supply and demand geography; if the recycling plants are closer to urban areas than the aggregate quarries this can incentivize companies to use this recycled product even if it is not initially cheaper.
 Management strategies , Europe ,"In Austria, there are new improvements in the recycling of unusable wood products to be burnt in the creation of cement which offsets the carbon footprint of both products.The EU urges local authorities who issue demolition and renovation permits to ensure that a high-quality waste management plan is being followed, and they emphasize the need for post-demolition follow-ups in order to determine if the implemented plans are being followed. They also suggest the use of taxation to reduce the economic advantage of the landfills to create a situation where recycling becomes a reasonable choice financially."
 Management strategies , Europe ,"However, they do include the fact that the tax should only apply to recyclable waste materials. The main points of how the Europeans choose to address this issue of waste management is through the utilization of the tools given to a governing body to keep its people safe. Unlike in the United States, the EU's philosophy on waste management is not that it is an optional good thing to do when you can but a mandatory part of construction in the 21st century to ensure a healthy future for generations to follow."
 Management strategies , Europe ,"Taxing landfill has been most effective in Belgium, Denmark and Austria, which have all decreased their landfill disposal by over 30% since introducing the tax. Denmark successfully cut its landfill use by over 80%, reaching a recycling rate over 60%. In the United Kingdom, all personnel performing builders or construction waste clearance are required by law to be working for a CIS registered business. However, the waste generation in the UK continues to grow, but the rate of increase has slowed."
 Management strategies , United States ,"The United States has no national landfill tax or fee, but many states and local governments collect taxes and fees on the disposal of solid waste. The California Department of Resource Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) was created in 2010 to address the growing C&D waste problem in the United States. CalRecycle aids in the creation of C&D waste diversion model ordinance in local jurisdictions. They also provide information and other educational material on alternative C&D waste facilities. They promote these ordinances by creating incentive programs to encourage companies to participate in the waste diversion practices."
 Management strategies , United States ,"There are also available grants and loans to aid organizations in their waste reduction strategies. According to a survey, financially incentivizing stakeholders to reduce construction waste demonstrates favorable results. This information provides an alternative way to reduce the cost so that the industry is more careful in their project decisions from beginning to end.

 Etymology ,,"""Clinker"" is from Dutch, and was originally used in English to describe clinker bricks. The term was later applied to hard residue, due to its similar appearance. Clinker often is reused as a cheap material for paving footpaths. It is laid and rolled, and forms a hard path with a rough surface that presents less risk of slipping than most loose materials. In sufficient thickness such a layer drains well and is valuable for controlling muddiness."
 Etymology ,,"However, if laid without sufficient adhesive, it needs frequent rolling and addition of more clinker to maintain the path in good condition if it is subject to heavy foot traffic. In sewage treatment works, the foul water is first screened to remove floating debris. Then it is sedimented to remove insoluble particles. After this, it is sprayed over a filter bed of clinker. Aerobic microbes soon grow in hollows in the clinker, where they kill harmful anaerobic bacteria in the water and remove much of the offensive organic waste."
 Etymology ,,"Historically, clinker from coal-burning steamships simply was discarded overboard, leaving detectable trails on the seabed of some prominent steamship routes. As such, the deposits have proven to be of biological, historical and archaeological interest.Naturally occurring clinkers exist. For example, in the Powder River Basin is covered by clinkers from coal-seam fires, i.e., ""baked, welded and molded rocks formed by the natural burning of coal beds.""Distinguish, Cement clinker.

 Composition ,,"In 2014, 505.1 million tons of demolition debris was generated in the US. Out of the 505.1 million tons, the debris was composed of 353.6 million tons of concrete, 76.6 million tons of asphalt concrete, 35.8 million tons of wood product, 12.7 million tons of asphalt shingles, 11.8 million tons of brick and clay tile, 10.3 million tons of drywall and plaster, and 4.3 million tons of steel. Before demolition debris is extracted, contamination from lead, asbestos or other hazardous materials must be resolved. Hazardous materials must be disposed of separately, according to federal regulation."
 Composition ,,"Demolition debris can be disposed of in either Construction and Demolition Debris landfills or municipal solid waste landfills. Alternatively, debris may also be sorted and recycled. Sorting may happen as deconstruction on the demolition site, off-site at a sorting location, or at a Construction and Demolition recycling center. Once sorted, materials are managed separately and recycled accordingly. Concrete and Brick Concrete and brick can be recycled by crushing it into rubble. Once sorted, screened and contaminants are removed, reclaimed concrete or brick can be used in concrete aggregate, fill, road base, or riprap."
 Composition ,,"Mobile concrete crushers also allow for recycling of concrete on-site. Wood Wood can be reused, repurposed, recycled, or burned as bioenergy. Reused wood can eliminate the need for full-size new lumber if used for smaller building components. Repurposed or recycled wood can be used in pathways, coverings, mulches, compost, animal bedding, or particleboard. Using recycled wood as a bioenergy feedstock is advantageous because it has lower water content, about 20% water, compared to virgin lumber, about 60% water. Drywall Drywall is made primarily of gypsum."
 Composition ,,"Once the gypsum is depapered, it can be added in cement production, as a soil amendment, used in aerated composting, or recycled into new drywall. Gypsum recycling can be particularly beneficial because in landfill conditions gypsum will release hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas. Asphalt Asphalt, from shingles or asphalt concrete, is typically recycled and used in pavement. Metal Scrap metal is an established industry focused on the collection, buying, selling, and recycling of salvaged materials."

 History ,,"The import of pepe began in the 1960s, during the Kennedy administration, leading to the moniker ""Kennedy clothes"". Since the 1980s, hundreds of tons of pepe has been imported, usually packaged in huge bales. The clothes are so affordable, that a used boy's t-shirt from the United States could be sold for as little as thirteen cents in Haiti. Furthermore, at an affordable cost, local seamstresses make modifications to the clothing.In recent years, Haiti has seen an increase in the amount of clothing coming from the United States as a result of fast fashion.

 Types ,,"Anyone can search it, including the police, and any incriminating evidence recovered can be used at trial. This doctrine was established in The California v. Greenwood case, in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that there is no common law expectation of privacy for discarded materials. This has since led people to argue the legality of taking post-consumer waste for salvage value. Especially within the food system, there is a lot of waste occurring at the consumer end. Post-consumer waste accounts for a large proportion of food that is wasted."
 Types ,,"This can be attributed to many reasons, including the way in which food is labeled. According to a study published in 2020, the confusing labeling of ""use by"", ""consume by"", or ""sell by"" dates is a significant reason why food is wasted at such a high volume when the food is otherwise entirely edible. Another reason is the way that food is used once it reaches the average consumer household due to many factors, with the main factors being social, behavioral, and personal purchasing habits."
 Types ,,"Additionally, each of those factors influences each other and affects the amount of food that is wasted per person. Retail hazardous waste"
 Species used ,,"A variety of species can be used, including the black soldier fly. Due to convenience, fly species that are indigenous to the area of cultivation are often used. When using indigenous fly species, one tactic (employed by the Songhai Center in Benin) is to simply dump offal or meat that has exceeded the sell-by date in concrete bins. The bins are then covered with chicken wire to prevent any large animals from feeding. Then, flies deposit eggs on the offal and meat, and maggots hatch and consume it."
 Species used ,,"After that, the bins are filled with water, so the maggots start to float (separating themselves from any leftovers). The maggots are then harvested and the leftover is discarded or further processed (e.g., bones can be ground to bone meal). An alternative method can be seen used more commonly in small-scale applications, such as two trash bins stacked on top of each other. The bottom bin has a large hole cut on top, while the top has smaller, filtered holes on the bottom."
 Species used ,,"Food (waste) is then inserted and left into the top bin, where the flies lay their eggs and produce maggots, shifting and separating into the bottom bin. The maggots are often sold and used as animal feed, in particular, for fish, chickens, pigs, and ducks. AgriProtein, a British company specializing in insect protein production, is pushing for more international business, claiming to hold the potential to shift the fish-feed market away from energy-expensive fish farming. They can also be sold as fishing bait. Extracting insect fat, protein (for human consumption), and chitin is also possible."

 Etymology ,,"The phrase originates from the French word espoilelier, a verb conveying the meaning: to seize by violence, to plunder, to take by force. Spoil tips may be conical in shape, and can appear as conspicuous features of the landscape, or they may be much flatter and eroded, especially if vegetation has established itself. In Loos-en-Gohelle, in the former mining area of Pas-de-Calais, France, are a series of five very perfect cones, of which two rise 100 metres (330 ft) from the plain. Most commonly the term is used for the piles of waste earth materials removed during an excavation process."
 Etymology ,,"In surface mining (commonly called strip mining) for coal or other underground deposits, earth materials removed to expose the targeted deposit are piled up alongside the excavation site (commonly a strip mining pit) in spoil banks. A dredge in placer mining is used to dig up volumes of gravel and other earth materials, which are sent through sluices to remove gold or other minerals, and the remaining earth materials (""tailings"") are deposited behind the dredge in spoil banks."
 Etymology ,,"In hydraulic mining, high-pressure jets of water dislodge earth materials, which are put through sluices to sort out gold or other minerals, and the residual earth materials are left in spoil banks. The excavation of ditches and canals results in spoil banks being left along the side of the canal or ditch.Spoil banks can also refer to refuse heaps formed from removal of excess surface materials. For example, alongside livestock lots, spoil banks are formed of manure and other slurry periodically removed from the surface of the livestock lot areas."
 Etymology ,,"Spoil tips sometimes increased to millions of tons, and, having been abandoned, remain as huge piles today. They trap solar heat, making it difficult (although not impossible) for vegetation to take root; this encourages erosion and creates dangerous, unstable slopes. Existing techniques for regreening spoil tips include the use of geotextiles to control erosion as the site is resoiled and simple vegetation such as grass is seeded on the slope. The piles also create acid rock drainage, which pollutes streams and rivers."
 Etymology ,,"Environmental problems have included surface runoff of silt, and leaching of noxious chemical compounds from spoil banks exposed to weathering. These cause contamination of ground water, and other problems.In the United States, current state and federal mining regulations require that the earth materials from excavations be removed in such a fashion that they can be replaced after the mining operations cease in a process called mine reclamation, with oversight of mining corporations. This requires adequate reserves of monetary bonds to guarantee a completion of the reclamation process when mining becomes unprofitable or stops."
 Etymology ,,"(See for example, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.)"
 Environmental effects , Subterranean combustion ,"In some spoil tips, the waste resulting from industries such as coal or oil shale production can contain a relatively high proportion of hydrocarbons or coal dust. Spontaneous subterranean combustion may result, which can be followed by surface fires. In some coal mining districts, such fires were considered normal and no attempt was made to extinguish them.Such fires can follow slow combustion of residual hydrocarbons. Their extinction can require complete encasement, which can prove impossible for technical and financial reasons. Sprinkling is generally ineffective and injecting water under pressure counter-productive, because it carries oxygen, bringing the risk of explosion."
 Environmental effects , Subterranean combustion ,"The perceived weak environmental and public health effects of these fires leads generally to waiting for their natural extinction, which can take a number of decades."
 Environmental effects , Landslides ,"The problem of landslides in spoil tips was first brought to public attention in October 1966 in English speaking world when a spoil tip at Aberfan in Wales gave way, killing 144 people, 116 of them children. The tip was built over a spring, increasing its instability, and its height exceeded guidelines."
 Environmental effects , Landslides ,"Water from heavy rainfall had built up inside the tip, weakening the structure, until it suddenly collapsed onto a school below.The wider issue of stability had been known about prior to the Aberfan disaster; for example, it was discussed in a paper by Professor George Knox in 1927, but received little serious consideration by professional engineers and geologists — even to those directly concerned with mining."
 Environmental effects , Landslides ,"Also Aberfan disaster was not the first landslide with casualties: for example, in 1955 two successive landslides killed 73 people in Sasebo, Nagasaki in Japan.[ja] In February 2013, a spoil tip landslip caused the temporary closure of the Scunthorpe to Doncaster railway line in England.Landslides are rare in spoil tips after settling and vegetation growth act to stabilise the spoil. However, when heavy rain falls on spoil tips that are undergoing combustion, infiltrated water changes to steam; increasing pressure that may lead to a landslide."
 Environmental effects , Landslides ,"In Herstal, Belgium, a landslide on the Petite Bacnure spoil tip in April 1999 closed off a street for many years. Several techniques of re-utilising the spoil tips exist, usually including either geotechnics or recycling. Most commonly, old spoil tips are partially revegetated to provide valuable green spaces since they are inappropriate for building purposes. At Nœux-les-Mines, an artificial ski slope has been constructed on the tip. If spoil tips are considered to contain sufficient amounts of residual material, various methods are employed to remove the spoil from the site for subsequent processing."
 Environmental effects , Landslides ,"The oldest coal-based spoil tips may still contain enough coal to begin spontaneous slow combustion. This results in a form of vitrification of the shale, which then acquires sufficient mechanical strength to be of use in road construction. Some can therefore have a new life in being thus exploited; for example, the flattened pile of residue from the 11/19 site of Loos-en-Gohelle. Conversely, others are painstakingly preserved on account of their ecological wealth. With the passage of time, they become colonised with a variety of flora and fauna, sometimes foreign to the region. This diversity follows the mining exploitation."
 Environmental effects , Landslides ,"In South Wales some spoil tips are protected as Sites of Special Scientific Interest because they provide a unique habitat for 57 species of Lichen, several of which are at risk due to their limited environment being developed and by vegetation development.For example, because the miners threw their apple or pear cores into the wagons, the spoil tips became colonised with fruit trees. One can even observe the proliferation of buckler-leaved sorrel (French sorrel – Rumex scutatus), the seeds of which have been carried within the cracks in the pine timber used in the mines."
 Environmental effects , Landslides ,"Furthermore, on account of its dark colour, the south face of the spoil tip is significantly warmer than its surroundings, which contributes to the diverse ecology of the area. In this way, the spoil tip of Pinchonvalles, at Avion, hosts 522 different varieties of higher plants. Some sixty species of birds nest there.Some are used to cultivate vines, as in the case of Spoil Tip No. 7 of the coal-mining region of Mariemont-Bascoup near Chapelle-lez-Herlaimont (province of Hainaut). It produces some 3,000 litres of wine each year from a vineyard on its slopes."
 Environmental effects , Landslides ,"Some spoil tips are used for various sporting activities. The slopes of the spoil tips of 11/19 at Loos-en-Gohelle, or again, at Nœux-les-Mines, are used for winter sports, for example ski and luge. A piste was built on the flank of the heap. In Belgium, a long distance footpath along the spoil tips (GR-412, Sentier des terrils) was opened in 2005. It leads from Bernissart in western Hainaut to Blegny in the province of Liège."
 Environmental effects , Landslides ,"In the United States, mining companies have not been allowed to leave behind abandoned piles since the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was passed in 1977. The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center uses coal gob as a fuel source for energy production. One of the highest, at least in Western Europe, is in Loos-en-Gohelle in the former mining area of Pas-de-Calais, France. It comprises a range of five cones, of which two reach 180 metres (590 ft), surpassing the highest peak in Flanders, Mont Cassel."
 Environmental effects , Landslides ,"One of the regions of Europe most ""littered"" with (mountainous) spoil heaps is the Donbas, in Ukraine, especially around the city of Donetsk, which alone boasts about 130 of them. In Ukrainian, they are called terykony (терикону; singular терикон, terykon, 'soil cone') because of their shape. In Heringen, Hesse, Germany, is the popularly called ""Monte Kali"", made of spoil from potash mining and rising some 200 meters above the surrounding terrain. ""La Muntanya de Sal"" (The Salt Mountain), another potash mine spoil heap, lies in Cardona, Catalonia, at about 120 meters in height."
 Environmental effects , Landslides ,"A larger and higher pile is that of ""El runam del Cogulló"" (The Spoil Heap of El Cogulló), also known as ""El runam de la democràcia"" (The Slag Heap of Democracy) or ""Montsalat"" (Salty Boy Mountain), in Sallent, which has already grown higher than the small mountain it was named after (El Cogulló, 474 meters above sea level). Richard Llewellyn's novel How Green Was My Valley (1939) describes the social and environmental effects of coal mining in Wales at the turn of the 20th century."
 Environmental effects , Landslides ,"The local mine's spoil tip, which he calls a slag heap, is the central figure of devastation. Eventually the pile overtakes the entire valley and crushes Huw Morgan's house: The slagheap is moving again. I can hear it whispering to itself, and as it whispers, the walls of this brave little house are girding themselves to withstand the assault. For months, more that I ever thought it would have the courage to withstand, that great mound has borne down upon these walls, this roof."
 Environmental effects , Landslides ,"And for those months the great bully has been beaten, for in my father’s day men built well for they were craftsmen. Stout beams, honest blocks, good work, and love for the job, all that is in this house. But the slag heap moves, pressing on, down and down, over and all round this house which was my father’s and my mother’s and now is mine. Soon, perhaps in an hour, the house will be buried, and the slag heap will stretch from the top of the mountain right down to the river in the Valley."

 Terminology ,,"Tailings are also called mine dumps, culm dumps, slimes, refuse, leach residue, slickens, or terra-cone (terrikon)."
 Examples , Sulfide minerals ,"The effluent from the tailings from the mining of sulfidic minerals has been described as ""the largest environmental liability of the mining industry"". These tailings contain large amounts of pyrite (FeS2) and Iron(II) sulfide (FeS), which are rejected from the sought-after ores of copper and nickel, as well as coal. Although harmless underground, these minerals are reactive toward air in the presence of microorganisms, which if not properly managed lead to acid mine drainage."
 Examples , Phosphate rock mining ,"Between 100 million and 280 million tons of phosphogypsum waste are estimated to be produced annually as a consequence of the processing of phosphate rock for the production of phosphate fertilizers. In addition to being useless and abundant, phosphogypsum is radioactive due to the presence of naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and their daughter isotopes. Depending on the price achievable on the uranium market, extraction of the uranium content may be economically lucrative even absent other incentives, such as reducing the harm the radioactive heavy metals do to the environment."
 Examples , Aluminium ,Bauxite tailings is a waste product generated in the industrial production of aluminium. Making provision for the approximately 77 million tons that is produced annually is one of the most significant problems for the aluminium mining industry.
 Examples , Coal ,"Early mining operations often did not take adequate steps to make tailings areas environmentally safe after closure. Modern mines, particularly those in jurisdictions with well-developed mining regulations and those operated by responsible mining companies, often include the rehabilitation and proper closure of tailings areas in their costs and activities. For example, the Province of Quebec, Canada, requires not only the submission of a closure plan before the start of mining activity, but also the deposit of a financial guarantee equal to 100% of the estimated rehabilitation costs."
 Examples , Coal ,Tailings dams are often the most significant environmental liability for a mining project.Mine tailings may have economic value in carbon sequestration due to the large exposed surface area of the minerals. The fraction of tailings to ore can range from 90 to 98% for some copper ores to 20–50% of the other (less valuable) minerals.
 Examples , Coal ,"The rejected minerals and rocks liberated through mining and processing have the potential to damage the environment by releasing toxic metals (arsenic and mercury being two major culprits), by acid drainage (usually by microbial action on sulfide ores), or by damaging aquatic wildlife that rely on clear water (vs suspensions).Tailings ponds can also be a source of acid drainage, leading to the need for permanent monitoring and treatment of water passing through the tailings dam; the cost of mine cleanup has typically been 10 times that of mining industry estimates when acid drainage was involved."
 Environmental concerns , Disasters ,"The greatest danger of tailings ponds is dam failure, with the most publicized failure in the U.S. being the failure of a coal slurry dam in the West Virginia Buffalo Creek Flood of 1972, which killed 125 people; other collapses include the Ok Tedi environmental disaster in New Guinea, which destroyed the fishery of the Ok Tedi River. On average, worldwide, there is one big accident involving a tailings dam each year.Other disasters caused by tailings dam failures are, the 2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill and the Ajka alumina plant accident."
 Environmental concerns , Disasters ,"In 2015, the iron ore tailings dam failure at the Germano mine complex in Minas Gerais, Brazil, was the country's biggest environmental disaster. The dam breach caused the death of 19 people due to flooding of tailings slime downstream and affected some 400 km of the Doce river system with toxic effluence and out into the Atlantic Ocean. Tailings deposits tend to be located in rural areas or near marginalized communities, such as indigenous communities."
 Environmental concerns , Disasters ,"The Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management recommends that ""a human rights due diligence process is required to identify and address those that are most at risk from a tailings facility or its potential failure."" Historically, tailings were disposed of in the most convenient manner, such as in downstream running water or down drains. Because of concerns about these sediments in the water and other issues, tailings ponds came into use."
 Environmental concerns , Disasters ,"The sustainability challenge in the management of tailings and waste rock is to dispose of material, such that it is inert or, if not, stable and contained, to minimise water and energy inputs and the surface footprint of wastes and to move toward finding alternate uses."
 Storage methods , Tailings dams and ponds ,"Bounded by impoundments (an impoundment is a dam), these dams typically use ""local materials"" including the tailings themselves, and may be considered embankment dams. Traditionally, the only option for tailings storage was to deal with a tailings slurry. This slurry is a dilute stream of the tailings solids within water that was sent to the tailings storage area. The modern tailings designer has a range of tailings products to choose from depending upon how much water is removed from the slurry prior to discharge. The removal of water not only can create a better storage system in some cases (e.g."
 Storage methods , Tailings dams and ponds ,"dry stacking, see below) but can also assist in water recovery which is a major issue as many mines are in arid regions. In a 1994 description of tailings impoundments, however, the U.S. EPA stated that dewatering methods may be prohibitively expensive except in special circumstances. Subaqueous storage of tailings has also been used.Tailing ponds are areas of refused mining tailings where the waterborne refuse material is pumped into a pond to allow the sedimentation (meaning separation) of solids from the water. The pond is generally impounded with a dam, and known as tailings impoundments or tailings dams."
 Storage methods , Tailings dams and ponds ,"It was estimated in 2000 that there were about 3,500 active tailings impoundments in the world. The ponded water is of some benefit as it minimizes fine tailings from being transported by wind into populated areas where the toxic chemicals could be potentially hazardous to human health; however, it is also harmful to the environment. Tailing ponds are often somewhat dangerous because they attract wildlife such as waterfowl or caribou as they appear to be a natural pond, but they can be highly toxic and harmful to the health of these animals."
 Storage methods , Tailings dams and ponds ,"Tailings ponds are used to store the waste made from separating minerals from rocks, or the slurry produced from tar sands mining. Tailings are sometimes mixed with other materials such as bentonite to form a thicker slurry that slows the release of impacted water to the environment. There are many different subsets of this method, including valley impoundments, ring dikes, in-pit impoundments, and specially dug pits. The most common is the valley pond, which takes advantage of the natural topographical depression in the ground. Large earthen dams may be constructed and then filled with the tailings."
 Storage methods , Tailings dams and ponds ,"Exhausted open pit mines may be refilled with tailings. In all instances, due consideration must be made to contamination of the underlying water table, amongst other issues. Dewatering is an important part of pond storage, as the tailings are added to the storage facility the water is removed – usually by draining into decant tower structures. The water removed can thus be reused in the processing cycle. Once a storage facility is filled and completed, the surface can be covered with topsoil and revegetation commenced."
 Storage methods , Tailings dams and ponds ,"However, unless a non-permeable capping method is used, water that infiltrates into the storage facility will have to be continually pumped out into the future."
 Storage methods , Paste tailings ,Paste tailings is a modification to the conventional methods of disposal of tailings (pond storage). Conventional tailings slurries are composed of a low percent of solids and relatively high water content (normally ranging from 20% to 60% solids for most hard rock mining) and when deposited into the tailings pond the solids and liquids separate.
 Storage methods , Paste tailings ,In paste tailings the percent of solids in the tailings slurry is increased through the use of paste thickeners to produce a product where the minimal separation of water and solids occurs and the material is deposited into a storage area as a paste (with a consistency somewhat like toothpaste). Paste tailings has the advantage that more water is recycled in the processing plant and therefore the process is more water efficient than conventional tailings and there is a lower potential for seepage.
 Storage methods , Paste tailings ,However the cost of the thickening is generally higher than for conventional tailings and the pumping costs for the paste are also normally higher than for conventional tailings as positive displacement pumps are normally required to transport the tailings from the processing plant to the storage area. Paste tailings are used in several locations around the world including Sunrise Dam in Western Australia and Bulyanhulu Gold Mine in Tanzania.
 Storage methods , Dry stacking ,"Tailings do not have to be stored in ponds or sent as slurries into oceans, rivers or streams. There is a growing use of the practice of dewatering tailings using vacuum or pressure filters so the tailings can then be stacked. This saves water which potentially reduces the impacts on the environment in terms of a reduction in the potential seepage rates, space used, leaves the tailings in a dense and stable arrangement and eliminates the long-term liability that ponds leave after mining is finished."
 Storage methods , Dry stacking ,However although there are potential merits to dry stacked tailings these systems are often cost prohibitive due to increased capital cost to purchase and install the filter systems and the increase in operating costs (generally associated electricity consumption and consumables such as filter cloth) of such systems.
 Storage methods , Storage in underground workings ,"While disposal into exhausted open pits is generally a straightforward operation, disposal into underground voids is more complex. A common modern approach is to mix a certain quantity of tailings with waste aggregate and cement, creating a product that can be used to backfill underground voids and stopes. A common term for this is HDPF – High Density Paste Fill."
 Storage methods , Storage in underground workings ,"HDPF is a more expensive method of tailings disposal than pond storage, however it has many other benefits – not just environmental but it can significantly increase the stability of underground excavations by providing a means for ground stress to be transmitted across voids – rather than having to pass around them – which can cause mining induced seismic events like that suffered previously at the Beaconsfield Mine Disaster."
 Storage methods , Riverine tailings ,Usually called RTD – Riverine Tailings Disposal.
 Storage methods , Riverine tailings ,"In most environments, not a particularly environmentally sound practice, it has seen significant utilisation in the past, leading to such spectacular environmental damage as done by the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company in Tasmania to the King River, or the poisoning from the Panguna mine on Bougainville Island, which led to large-scale civil unrest on the island, and the eventual permanent closing of the mine.As of 2005, only three mines operated by international companies continued to use river disposal: The Ok Tedi mine, the Grasberg mine and the Porgera mine, all on New Guinea."
 Storage methods , Riverine tailings ,This method is used in these cases due to seismic activity and landslide dangers which make other disposal methods impractical and dangerous.
 Storage methods , Submarine tailings ,"Commonly referred to as STD (Submarine Tailings Disposal) or DSTD (Deep Sea Tailings Disposal). Tailings can be conveyed using a pipeline then discharged so as to eventually descend into the depths. Practically, it is not an ideal method, as the close proximity to off-shelf depths is rare. When STD is used, the depth of discharge is often what would be considered shallow, and extensive damage to the seafloor can result due to covering by the tailings product."
 Storage methods , Submarine tailings ,"It is also critical to control the density and temperature of the tailings product, to prevent it from travelling long distances, or even floating to the surface. This method is used by the gold mine on Lihir Island; its waste disposal has been viewed by environmentalists as highly damaging, while the owners claim that it is not harmful."
 Storage methods , Phytostabilisation ,"Phytostabilisation is a form of phytoremediation that uses hyperaccumulator plants for long-term stabilisation and containment of tailings, by sequestering pollutants in soil near the roots. The plant's presence can reduce wind erosion, or the plant's roots can prevent water erosion, immobilise metals by adsorption or accumulation, and provide a zone around the roots where the metals can precipitate and stabilise. Pollutants become less bioavailable and livestock, wildlife, and human exposure is reduced. This approach can be especially useful in dry environments, which are subject to wind and water dispersion."
 Storage methods , Different methods ,"Considerable effort and research continues to be made into discovering and refining better methods of tailings disposal. Research at the Porgera Gold Mine is focusing on developing a method of combining tailings products with coarse waste rock and waste muds to create a product that can be stored on the surface in generic-looking waste dumps or stockpiles. This would allow the current use of riverine disposal to cease. Considerable work remains to be done. However, co-disposal has been successfully implemented by several designers including AMEC at, for example, the Elkview Mine in British Columbia."
 Storage methods , Pond reclamation by microbiology ,"During extraction of the oil from oil sand, tailings consisting of water, silt, clays and other solvents are also created. This solid will become mature fine tailings by gravity. Foght et al (1985) estimated that there are 103 anaerobic heterotrophs and 104 sulfate-reducing prokaryotes per milliliter in the tailings pond, based on conventional most probable number methods. Foght set up an experiment with two tailings ponds and an analysis of the archaea, bacteria, and the gas released from tailings ponds showed that those were methanogens."
 Storage methods , Pond reclamation by microbiology ,"As the depth increased, the moles of CH4 released actually decreased.Siddique (2006, 2007) states that methanogens in the tailings pond live and reproduce by anaerobic degradation, which will lower the molecular weight from naphtha to aliphatic, aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and methane. Those archaea and bacteria can degrade the naphtha, which was considered as waste during the procedure of refining oil. Both of those degraded products are useful. Aliphatic, aromatic hydrocarbons and methane can be used as fuel in the humans' daily lives. In other words, these methanogens improve the coefficient of utilization."
 Storage methods , Pond reclamation by microbiology ,"Moreover, these methanogens change the structure of the tailings pond and help the pore water efflux to be reused for processing oil sands. Because the archaea and bacteria metabolize and release bubbles within the tailings, the pore water can go through the soil easily. Since they accelerate the densification of mature fine tailings, the tailings ponds are enabled to settle the solids more quickly so that the tailings can be reclaimed earlier. Moreover, the water released from the tailings can be used in the procedure of refining oil. Reducing the demand of water can also protect the environment from drought."
 Storage methods , Reprocessing ,"As mining techniques and the price of minerals improve, it is not unusual for tailings to be reprocessed using new methods, or more thoroughly with old methods, to recover additional minerals. Extensive tailings dumps of Kalgoorlie / Boulder in Western Australia were re-processed profitably in the 1990s by KalTails Mining.A machine called the PET4K Processing Plant has been used in a variety of countries for the past 20 years to remediate contaminated tailings. The UN and business communities developed an international standard for tailings management in 2020 after the critical failure of the Brumadinho dam disaster."

" Differentiating between ""waste oil"" and ""used oil"" ",,"The U.S. EPA defines the term ""used oil"" as any petroleum or synthetic oil that has been used, and as a result of such use is contaminated by physical or chemical properties. ""Used oil"" is a precise regulatory term. ""Waste oil"" is a more generic term for oil that has been contaminated with substances that may or may not be hazardous. Any oil contaminated with hazardous waste may itself be a hazardous waste, and if so, must be managed subject to hazardous waste management standards."
" Differentiating between ""waste oil"" and ""used oil"" ",,"Both used oil and waste oil require proper recycling or disposal to avoid creating an environmental problem. Some examples of types of products that after use, can be labeled as used oil are: hydraulic oil, transmission oil, brake fluids, motor oil, crankcase oil, gear box oil, synthetic oil, and grades 1, 2, 3 and 4 fuel oil."

 Definitions ,,"What constitutes waste depends on the eye of the beholder; one person's waste can be a resource for another person. Though waste is a physical object, its generation is a physical and psychological process. The definitions used by various agencies are as below."
 Definitions , United Nations Environment Program ,"According to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal of 1989, Art. 2(1), ""'Wastes' are substance or objects, which are disposed of or are intended to be disposed of or are required to be disposed of by the provisions of national law""."
 Definitions , United Nations Statistics Division ,"The UNSD Glossary of Environment Statistics describes waste as ""materials that are not prime products (that is, products produced for the market) for which the generator has no further use in terms of his/her own purposes of production, transformation or consumption, and of which he/she wants to dispose. Wastes may be generated during the extraction of raw materials, the processing of raw materials into intermediate and final products, the consumption of final products, and other human activities. Residuals recycled or reused at the place of generation are excluded."""
 Definitions , European Union ,"Under the Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC, Art. 3(1), the European Union defines waste as ""an object the holder discards, intends to discard or is required to discard."" For a more structural description of the Waste Directive, see the European Commission's summary."
 Types of waste , Municipal waste ,"The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development also known as OECD defines municipal solid waste (MSW) as ""waste collected and treated by or for municipalities"". Typically this type of waste includes household waste, commercial waste, and demolition or construction waste. In 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency concluded that 292.4 tons of municipal waste was generated which equated to about 4.9 pounds per day per person. Out of the 292.4 tons, approximately 69 million tons were recycled, and 25 million tons were composted."
 Types of waste , Household waste and commercial waste ,"Household waste more commonly known as trash or garbage are items that are typically thrown away daily from ordinary households. Items often included in this category include product packaging, yard waste, clothing, food scraps, appliance, paints, and batteries. Most of the items that are collected by municipalities end up in landfills across the world. In the United States, it is estimated that 11.3 million tons of textile waste is generated. On an individual level, it is estimated that the average American throws away 81.5 pounds of clothes each year."
 Types of waste , Household waste and commercial waste ,"As online shopping becomes more prevalent, items such as cardboard, bubble wrap, shipping envelopes are ending up in landfills across the United States. The EPA has estimated that approximately 10.1 million tons of plastic containers and packaging ended up landfills in 2018. The EPA noted that only 30.5% of plastic containers and packaging was recycled or combusted as an energy source. Additionally, approximately 940,000 pounds of cardboard ends up in the landfill each year.Commercial waste is very similar to household waste. To be considered as commercial waste, it must come from a business or commercial occupancy."
 Types of waste , Household waste and commercial waste ,"This can be restaurants, retail occupants, manufacturing occupants or similar businesses. Typically, commercial waste contains similar items such as food scraps, cardboard, paper, and shipping materials. Generally speaking, commercial waste creates more waste than household waste on a per location basis."
 Types of waste , Construction and demolition waste ,"The EPA defines this type of waste as ""Construction and Demolition (C&D) debris is a type of waste that is not included in municipal solid waste (MSW)."" Items typically found in C&D include but are not limited to steel, wood products, drywall and plaster, brick and clay tile, asphalt shingles, concrete, and asphalt. Generally speaking, construction and demolition waste can be categorized as any components needed to build infrastructures. In 2018, the EPA estimated that the US generated approximately 600 million tons of C&D waste."
 Types of waste , Construction and demolition waste ,The waste generated by construction and demolition is often intended to be reused or is sent to the landfill. Examples of reused waste is milled asphalt can be used again for the asphalt mixture or fill dirt can be used to level grade.
 Types of waste , Hazardous waste ,"The EPA defines hazardous waste as ""a waste with properties that make it dangerous or capable of having a harmful effect on human health or the environment."" Hazardous Waste falls under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under the RCRA, the EPA has the authority to control hazardous waste during its entire lifecycle. This means from the point of creation to the point where it has been properly disposed of. The life cycle of hazardous waste includes generation, transportation, treatment, and storage and disposal. All of which are included in the RCRA."
 Types of waste , Hazardous waste ,"Some forms of hazardous waste include radioactive waste, explosive waste, and electronic waste."
 Types of waste , Radioactive waste ,"Radioactive waste, often referred to as nuclear waste, is produced by various industries such as nuclear power plants, nuclear reactors, hospitals, research centers, and mining facilities. Any activity that involves radioactive material can generate radioactive waste. Furthermore, such waste emits radioactive particles, which if not handled correctly, can be both an environmental hazard as well as a human health hazard. When dealing with radioactive waste, it is extremely important to understand the necessary protocols and follow the correct precautions."
 Types of waste , Radioactive waste ,"Failure to handle and recycle these materials can have catastrophic consequences and potentially damage the site's ecosystems for years to come.Radioactive waste is monitored and regulated by multiple governmental agencies such as Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Transportation (DOT), and Department of the Interior (DOI). Each agency plays an important role in creating, handling, and properly disposing of radioactive waste. A brief description of each agency's role can be found below."
 Types of waste , Radioactive waste ,"NRC: ""Licenses and regulates the receipt and possession of high-level waste at privately owned facilities and at certain DOE facilities.""DOE: ""Plans and carries out programs for sand handling of DOE-generated radioactive wastes, develops waste disposal technologies, and will design, construct and operate disposal facilities for DOE-generated and commercial high-level wastes.""EPA: ""Develops environmental standards and federal radiation protection guidance for offsite radiation due to the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level and transuranic radioactive wastes.""DOT: ""Regulates both the packaging and carriage of all hazardous materials including radioactive waste.""DOI: ""Through the U.S."
 Types of waste , Radioactive waste ,"Geological Survey, conducts laboratory and field geologic investigations in support of DOE's waste disposal programs and collaborates with DOE on earth science technical activities.""The US currently defines five types of radioactive waste, as shown below. High-level Waste: This type of radioactive waste is generated from nuclear reactors or reprocessing spent nuclear fuel.Transuranic Waste: This type of radioactive waste is man-made and has an atomic number of 92 or higher.Uranium or thorium mill tailings: This type of radioactive waste is a result after the mining or milling or uranium or thorium ore.Low-level waste: This type of radioactive waste is radioactively contaminated waste."
 Types of waste , Radioactive waste ,"It is typically generated from industrial processes or research. Examples of these items include paper, protective clothing, bags, and cardboard.Technologically enhanced naturally-occurring radioactive material (TENORM): This type of radioactive waste is created through human activity such as mining, oil and gas drilling, and water treatment where naturally-occurring radiological material (NORM) becomes concentrated."
 Types of waste , Energetic hazardous waste ,"The EPA defines energetic hazardous waste as ""wastes that have the potential to detonate and bulk military propellants which cannot safely be disposed of through other modes of treatments."" The items which typically fall under this category include munitions, fireworks, flares, hobby rockets, and automobile propellants."
 Types of waste , Munitions ,"Munitions were added to hazardous waste in 1997 when the EPA finalized RCRA. A special rule was added to address munitions in waste. This new rule is commonly referred to as the Military Munitions Rule. The EPA defines military munitions as ""all types of both conventional and chemical ammunition products and their components, produced by or for the military for national defense and security (including munitions produced by other parties under contract to or acting as an agent for DOD—in the case of Government Owned/Contractor Operated [GOCO] operations)."" The entire rule can be found here."
 Types of waste , Munitions ,"While a large percentage of munitions waste is generated by the government or governmental contractors, residents also throw away expired or faulty ammunition inside their household waste."
 Types of waste ," Fireworks, flares, and hobby rockets ","Every year, the US generates this type of waste from both the commercial and consumer aspects. This waste is often generated from fireworks, signal flares and hobby rockets which have been damaged, failed to operate or for other reasons. Due to their chemical properties, these types of devices are extremely dangerous."
 Types of waste , Automobile airbag propellants ,"While automobile airbag propellants are not as common as munitions and fireworks, they share similar properties which makes them extremely hazardous. Airbag propellants characteristics of reactivity and ignitability are the characteristics which qualify for hazardous waste. When disposed undeployed, leaves these two hazardous characteristics intact. To properly dispose of these items, they must be safely deployed which removes these hazardous characteristics.The EPA includes the waste of automobile airbag propellants under the RCRA. In 2018, the EPA issued a final rule on handling of automobile airbag propellants. The ""interim final rule""provides an exemption of entities which install and remove airbags."
 Types of waste , Automobile airbag propellants ,"This includes automobile dealerships, salvage yards, automobile repair facilities and collision centers. The handler and transporter are exempt from RCRA, but the airbag waste collection facility is not exempt. Once the airbags have met the collection center, it will then be classified as RCRA hazardous waste and must be disposed or recycled at a RCRA disposal facility."
 Types of waste , Electronic waste ,"Electronic waste, often referred to as ""E-Waste"" or ""E-Scrap,"" are often thrown away or sent to a recycler. E-Waste continues to end up in landfills across the world. The EPA estimates that in 2009, 2.37 million tons of televisions, computers, cell phones, printers, scanners, and fax machines were discarded by US consumers. Only 25% of these devices were recycled; the remainder ended up in landfills across the US. E-Waste contains many elements that can be recycled or re-used. Typically speaking, electronics are encased in a plastic or light metal enclosure."
 Types of waste , Electronic waste ,"Items such as computer boards, wiring, capacitors, and small motor items are common types of E-waste. Of these items, the internal components include oil, iron, gold, palladium, platinum, and copper. All of which are mined from the earth's core. For these items to be mined, it requires massive amounts of energy to operate the equipment, which emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Donating e-waste to recycling centers or refurbishing this equipment can reduce the greenhouse gases emitted through the mining process. It will also lower the usage of our naturally formed products to ensure future generations will have sufficient natural resources."
 Types of waste , Electronic waste ,"As this issue continued to grow, President Obama established the Interagency Task Force on Electronics Stewardship in November 2010. The overall goal for this task was to develop a national strategy for handling and proper disposal of electronic waste. The task force would work with the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), EPA, and the US General Services Administration (GSA). The task force released the final product, the National Strategy for Electronics Stewardship report. The report focuses on four goals of the federal government's plan to enhance the management of electronics, as shown below.1. Incentivizing greener design of electronics 2."
 Types of waste , Electronic waste ,"Leading by example 3. Increasing domestic recycling 4. Reducing harmful exports of e-waste and building capacity in developing countries.E-Waste is not only a problem in the US, but also a global issue. To tackle this issue, requires collaboration from multiple agencies across the world. Some agencies include U.S. EPA, Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (Taiwan EPA), International E-Waste Management Network (IEMN), and environmental offices from Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and North America."
 Types of waste , Mixed waste ,"Mixed waste is a term that has different definitions based its context. Most commonly, Mixed Waste refers to hazardous waste which contains radioactive material. In this context, the management of mixed waste is regulated by the EPA and RCRA and Atomic Energy Act. The Hazardous materials content is regulated by RCRA while the radiological component is regulated by the Department of Energy (DOE) and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Mixed waste can also be defined as a type of waste which includes recyclable materials and organic materials."
 Types of waste , Mixed waste ,"Some examples of mixed waste in this context include a combination of broken glassware, floor sweepings, non-repairable household goods, non-recyclable plastic and metal, and clothing and furnishings. Additionally, ashes and soot, residential renovation waste materials are also included under this definition."
 Types of waste , Medical Waste ,"This type of waste is typically generated from hospitals, physicians' offices, dental practices, blood banks, veterinary offices, and research facilities. This waste has often been contaminated with bodily fluids from humans or animals. Examples of this type of contamination can include blood, vomit, urine, and other bodily fluids. Concerns started to generate when medical waste was appearing on east coast beaches in the 1980's. This forced congress to pass the Medical Waste Tracking Act."
 Types of waste , Medical Waste ,"This act was only in effect for approximately 3 years after the EPA concluded the ""disease-causing medical waste was greatest at the point of generation and naturally tapers off after that point.""Prior to the Hospital Medical Infectious Waste Incinerator (HMIWI) standard, approximately 90% of the infectious waste was incinerated before 1997. Due to the potential of negatively affect air quality, alternative treatment and disposal technologies for medical waste was developed. These new alternatives include: Thermal Treatment, such as microwave technologies Steam sterilization, such as autoclaving Electropyrolysis Chemical mechanical systems There are many issues that surround reporting waste."
 Types of waste , Medical Waste ,"It is most commonly measured by size or weight, and there is a stark difference between the two. For example, organic waste is much heavier when it is wet, and plastic or glass bottles can have different weights but be the same size. On a global scale it is difficult to report waste because countries have different definitions of waste and what falls into waste categories, as well as different ways of reporting. Based on incomplete reports from its parties, the Basel Convention estimated 338 million tonnes of waste was generated in 2001."
 Types of waste , Medical Waste ,"For the same year, OECD estimated 4 billion tonnes from its member countries. Despite these inconsistencies, waste reporting is still useful on a small and large scale to determine key causes and locations, and to find ways of preventing, minimizing, recovering, treating, and disposing waste."
 Costs , Environmental costs ,"Inappropriately managed waste can attract rodents and insects, which can harbour gastrointestinal parasites, yellow fever, worms, the plague and other conditions for humans, and exposure to hazardous wastes, particularly when they are burned, can cause various other diseases including cancers.Toxic waste materials can contaminate surface water, groundwater, soil, and air which causes more problems for humans, other species, and ecosystems. A form of waste disposal involving combustion creates a significant amount of greenhouse gases. When the burned waste contains metals, it can create toxic gases. On the other hand, when the waste contains plastics, the gases produce contain CO2."
 Costs , Environmental costs ,"As global warming and CO2 emission increase, soil begins to become a larger carbon sink and will become increasingly volatile for our plant life."
 Costs , Social costs ,"Waste management is a significant environmental justice issue. Many of the environmental burdens cited above are more often borne by marginalized groups, such as racial minorities, women, and residents of developing nations. NIMBY (not in my back yard) is the opposition of residents to a proposal for a new development because it is close to them. However, the need for expansion and siting of waste treatment and disposal facilities is increasing worldwide."
 Costs , Social costs ,"There is now a growing market in the transboundary movement of waste, and although most waste that flows between countries goes between developed nations, a significant amount of waste is moved from developed to developing nations."
 Costs , Economic costs ,"The economic costs of managing waste are high, and are often paid for by municipal governments; money can often be saved with more efficiently designed collection routes, modifying vehicles, and with public education. Environmental policies such as pay as you throw can reduce the cost of management and reduce waste quantities. Waste recovery (that is, recycling, reuse) can curb economic costs because it avoids extracting raw materials and often cuts transportation costs. ""Economic assessment of municipal waste management systems – case studies using a combination of life-cycle assessment (LCA) and life-cycle costing (LCC)""."
 Costs , Economic costs ,"The location of waste treatment and disposal facilities often reduces property values due to noise, dust, pollution, unsightliness, and negative stigma. The informal waste sector consists mostly of waste pickers who scavenge for metals, glass, plastic, textiles, and other materials and then trade them for a profit. This sector can significantly alter or reduce waste in a particular system, but other negative economic effects come with the disease, poverty, exploitation, and abuse of its workers."
 Costs , Affecting communities ,"People in developing countries suffer from contaminated water and landfills caused by unlawful government policies that allow first-world countries and companies to transport their trash to their homes and oftentimes near bodies of water. Those same governments do not use any waste trade profits to create ways to manage landfills or clean water sources. Photographer Kevin McElvaney documents the world’s biggest e-waste dump called Agbogbloshie in Accra, Ghana, which used to be a wetland."
 Costs , Affecting communities ,"The young men and children that work in Agbogbloshie smash devices to get to the metals, obtain burns, eye damage, lung and back problems, chronic nausea, debilitating headaches, and respiratory problems and most workers die from cancer in their 20s (McElvaney). In McElvaney’s photos, kids in fields burning refrigerators and computers with blackened hands and trashed clothes and animals, such as cows with open wounds, in the dumpsite. There are piles of waste used as makeshift bridges over lakes, with metals and chemicals just seeping into the water and groundwater that could be linked to homes' water systems."
 Costs , Affecting communities ,"The same unfortunate situation and dumps/landfills can be seen in similar countries that are considered the third world, such as other West African countries and China. Many Advocating for waste management, stop waste trade, create wastewater treatment facilities, and ultimately provide a clean and accessible water source. The health of all these people in landfills and water are human necessities/rights that are being taken away."
 Management , Wastewater facilities ,"Wastewater treatment facilities remove pollutants and contaminants physically and chemically to clean water to be returned to society. The South Gippsland Water Organization breaks down the three steps of waste-water treatment. The primary treatment is to sift through the water to remove large solids to leave oils and small particles in the water. Secondary treatment to dissolve/remove oils, particles, and micro-organisms from the water to be prepared for tertiary treatment to chemically disinfect the water with chlorine or with UV light."
 Management , Wastewater facilities ,"“For most industrial applications, a 150,000 GPD capacity WWTS would cost an estimated $500,000 to $1.5 million inclusive of all necessary design, engineering, equipment, installation, and startup”. With such a simple solution that has been proven to clean our water to be reused and is relatively inexpensive, there is no excuse why there should not be a waste-water treatment facility in every country, every state, and every town."
 Management , Benefits ,"“Right now, according to a NASA-led study, many of the world’s freshwater sources are being drained faster than they are being replenished. The water table is dropping all over the world. There’s not an infinite supply of water”. There is a need to preserve every resource, every finite water source that we do have left to maintain our lives and lifestyles. Able countries helping under-developed countries with their creation of wastewater treatments benefits society."
 Management , Benefits ,"With the addition of wastewater treatment facilities with spending a few million dollars and infrastructure to clean our areas and freshwater to reuse instead of over-using our land and water supply, which would be the greatest cost. Another cost of not adding wastewater treatments in countries is that people have no choice but to clean with, cook with, or drink the contaminated water which has caused millions of disease cases and deaths. “Between 400,000 and 1 million people die each year in developing countries because of diseases caused by mismanaged waste, estimates poverty charity Tearfund”."
 Management , Benefits ,Society has the means to decrease or even eliminate this way of death and save millions of lives by providing the simple human necessity of clean water.
 Utilization , Energy recovery ,"Energy recovery from waste is using non-recyclable waste materials and extracting from it heat, electricity, or energy through a variety of processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, and anaerobic digestion. This process is referred to as waste-to-energy. There are several ways to recover energy from waste. Anaerobic digestion is a naturally occurring process of decomposition where organic matter is reduced to a simpler chemical component in the absence of oxygen. Incineration or direct controlled burning of municipal solid waste to reduce waste and make energy."
 Utilization , Energy recovery ,"Secondary recovered fuel is the energy recovery from waste that cannot be reused or recycled from mechanical and biological treatment activities. Pyrolysis involves heating of waste, with the absence of oxygen, to high temperatures to break down any carbon content into a mixture of gaseous and liquid fuels and solid residue. Gasification is the conversion of carbon rich material through high temperature with partial oxidation into a gas stream."
 Utilization , Energy recovery ,"Plasma arc heating is the very high heating of municipal solid waste to temperatures ranging from 3,000 to 10,000 °C, where energy is released by an electrical discharge in an inert atmosphere.Using waste as fuel can offer important environmental benefits. It can provide a safe and cost-effective option for wastes that would normally have to be dealt with through disposal."
 Utilization , Energy recovery ,"It can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by diverting energy use from fossil fuels, while also generating energy and using waste as fuel can reduce the methane emissions generated in landfills by averting waste from landfills.There is some debate in the classification of certain biomass feedstock as wastes. Crude Tall Oil (CTO), a co-product of the pulp and papermaking process, is defined as a waste or residue in some European countries when in fact it is produced “on purpose” and has significant value add potential in industrial applications."
 Utilization , Energy recovery ,"Several companies use CTO to produce fuel, while the pine chemicals industry maximizes it as a feedstock “producing low-carbon, bio-based chemicals” through cascading use. Education and awareness in the area of waste and waste management is increasingly important from a global perspective of resource management. The Talloires Declaration is a declaration for sustainability concerned about the unprecedented scale and speed of environmental pollution and degradation, and the depletion of natural resources."
 Utilization , Energy recovery ,"Local, regional, and global air pollution; accumulation and distribution of toxic wastes; destruction and depletion of forests, soil, and water; depletion of the ozone layer and emission of ""green house"" gases threaten the survival of humans and thousands of other living species, the integrity of the earth and its biodiversity, the security of nations, and the heritage of future generations. Several universities have implemented the Talloires Declaration by establishing environmental management and waste management programs, e.g. the waste management university project. University and vocational education are promoted by various organizations, e.g. WAMITAB and Chartered Institution of Wastes Management."

 Background ,,"Waste House has its origins in an earlier project by Duncan Baker-Brown, a senior lecturer at the university and a director of architecture firm BBM Sustainable Design based at Cooksbridge railway station in East Sussex. On Channel 4 television programme Grand Designs, he and designer and television presenter Kevin McCloud assembled a ""low-energy ... ecologically friendly"" prefabricated house made of organic materials. It was the first such building to be constructed in the United Kingdom. Baker-Brown was responsible for the design of this building, which was in turn referred to as ""The House that Kevin Built""."
 Background ,,"Originally Baker-Brown planned simply to take down the building and re-erect it at the University. Instead, the temporary building formed the prototype for Waste House, and since 2008 work has been undertaken at the University of Brighton Faculty of Arts to develop the ideas and techniques used on the programme in order to build a permanent house which can be used to test materials, construction theories and new techniques. It is intended to be ""a real live research project"" as well as a building which the university and other groups can use."
 Background ,,"Work was planned to begin in 2012 in time for an end-of-year completion date and a public opening in February 2013. These dates were not achieved, but preparation started on 26 November 2012 and by May 2013 construction was underway. Work finished in April 2014, the building was featured as part of the Brighton Festival the following month, the public were able to view the interior during June 2014, and by August 2014 Waste House was complete. Construction cost £140,000 and the total value of the contract was £200,000."
 Background ,,"Waste House is the first permanent public building in Europe made from waste material.Over 300 students from the University of Brighton, City College Brighton & Hove (CCB) and apprentices from housing provider Mears Group were involved in the project. The construction work was mainly undertaken by CCB students, the Mears apprentices and some volunteers, led by a project manager from Mears Group. Students learning carpentry at CCB designed the timber-framed structure and the ""fine timber staircase, finished with a decorative flourish of offcuts"". Many of the structural elements were created in the college's own workshops."
 Background ,,"University of Brighton Faculty of Arts students worked with Baker-Brown on the design, the selection of materials and on interior features such as furniture. Overall, 97.5% of the time taken to build Waste House—2,507 person-days—was provided by students and volunteers, and about 700 people worked on the project. A major aim of the project was to introduce students and apprentices to sustainable building techniques and to allow them to continue testing their ideas by retrofitting new fixtures."
 Background ,,"The purpose of building Waste House was to demonstrate that material considered to be waste, and therefore destined for landfill, could be used to create a viable permanent building. Baker-Brown stated that in the United Kingdom, 20% of construction materials go to waste—so the equivalent of one house worth of unwanted material is generated for every five houses built. Between 85% and 90% of the materials used in Waste House are building waste of this type or ordinary household and consumer products which are no longer needed."
 Background ,,"Structurally, the building is timber-framed and uses a mixture of reclaimed wood and plywood from various sources around Brighton. It has been constructed on foundations of ground granulated blast-furnace slag. The ""rather unusual"" walls consist of a mixture of waste chalk and clay left over or reclaimed from building sites. These are compressed into rammed earth-style walls using pneumatic equipment—a technique which improves the building's energy conservation, because such walls store solar energy for a long time. On the outside the walls are covered with ""a scaly surface of rubbery black shingles""—2,000 carpet tiles from an old office building in Brighton."
 Background ,,"Their fire-retardant, waterproof underlay faces outwards, providing weatherproof cladding and insulation. Their mostly black appearance is varied in places by being laminated with plastic bags in various colours. Between the carpet tiles and the walls themselves, some new material was used: DuPont supplied about 400 square metres (4,300 sq ft) of ""breathable membrane"", to further weatherproof the building, and ""Housewrap"" moisture seal. Inside, the walls are laid with reclaimed plasterboard coated with surplus paint from construction sites. The main load-bearing wall is formed of 10 tonnes of compressed chalk spoil from a building site nearby."
 Background ,,"Throughout the building, the space between the boarding and the exterior clay and chalk blocks has been filled with household rubbish which will act as insulation. Sensors have been installed to monitor how well heat is kept in, which will form part of a PhD project for a University of Brighton student."
 Background ,,"The insulation materials are revealed in various places by ""little peephole windows"" (transparent panels in the walls): as well as some secondhand conventional (polyurethane) insulation material, there are floppy disks, 4,000 VHS cassettes, 4,000 DVD and video cases, two tonnes of denim offcuts from pairs of jeans and denim jackets, cycle inner tubes to insulate windows, and 20,000 toothbrushes."
 Background ,,"The cassettes and other media came from the stock of rental shops which were closing down; an aeroplane cleaning company at nearby Gatwick Airport donated most of the toothbrushes, which were provided to First and Business Class passengers and discarded after one use, and some others were provided by Brighton schoolchildren; and the denim came from textile traders (in particular, one company which turned imported jeans into denim shorts by cutting off the legs).Many materials were obtained on the Freegle website—a free reuse and recycling service developed from The Freecycle Network."
 Background ,,"These include the clay tiles on the roof, the kitchen and some of the insulation material. Cat Fletcher, one of the founders of Freegle UK, was part of the Waste House project team and was responsible for obtaining many of the materials, both from Freegle members (numbering 18,000 in the Brighton area) and from other sources. Other than the specialist cladding materials supplied by DuPont, the only new products used in the building are the triple-glazed windows and the material used in the wiring and plumbing. In September 2015, Waste House was nominated for that year's Stephen Lawrence Prize."
 Background ,,"This Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) award, named after the aspiring architect who was murdered in 1993, is for projects with a budget of up to £1 million. In its shortlisting for the award, which was judged in mid-October 2015, judges from the RIBA stated that the house ""has sufficient scientific integrity to be taken seriously by the construction industry"" and the potential to alter political attitudes to recycling."
 Background ,,"Waste House was one of seven buildings nominated for the prize, which was won by a fishing hut designed by Niall McLaughlin Architects.Waste House was one of several buildings in Sussex, along with the Chichester Festival Theatre and St Botolph's Church at Botolphs, to win an award at the RIBA South East Regional Awards in April 2015. It was described as ""a project with an interesting agenda"" and ""a collective of experiments in which students learn by application"". Duncan Baker-Brown also won an Argus Achievement Award from local newspaper The Argus.RIBA awarded Waste House a Sustainability Award in 2014."
 Background ,,"It described ""some of the experiments [as] extraordinary"", commenting specifically on the toothbrush insulation and the vinyl banner vapour control layers, and noted that ""the continually evolving [design] brief"" would ""continue to question important issues of recycling that affect everyone"".The 2Degrees Network, a worldwide collaborative association of sustainable businesses, awarded the building a Champions Award in 2014. Waste House was described as ""an investment in educating the next generation of designers and builders to think and build more sustainably"".In view of its low energy use, Waste House has a building energy rating of A."

 Location , Neighbourhood ,"Whitechapel Mount was on the south side of the Whitechapel Road, on the ancient route from the City of London to Mile End, Stratford, Colchester and Harwich. In the 18th century and later the surroundings were mostly fields: grazing for cows or market gardens.Leaving London, a traveller would pass the church of St Mary Matfelon (origin of the name ""white chapel"") on the right, then a windmill, before arriving at the Mount. Across the Whitechapel Road was a burying ground and the Ducking Pond."
 Location , Neighbourhood ,"Further east, at the turnpike, the name changed to Mile End Road, with Dog Row (today Cambridge Heath Road) branching off to Bethnal Green. According to John Strype (1720) the neighbourhood was a busy one, with good inns for travellers in Whitechapel and good houses for sea captains in Mile End. Even so, said Strype, the Whitechapel Road was ""pestered"" by illegally built, poor quality dwellings.Another source said it was infested by highwaymen, footpads and riff-raff of all kinds who preyed on travellers to and from London. News and court reports speak of murders and robberies."
 Location , Neighbourhood ,"In two Old Bailey cases stolen property was buried in, and recovered from, Whitechapel Mount. It was a place of resort for pugilists and dog-fighters.From the summit of Whitechapel Mount an extensive view of the hamlets of Limehouse, Shadwell, and Ratcliff could be obtained."
 Location , On maps ,"Whitechapel Mount's position is first depicted in a 1673 building plan by Sir Christopher Wren, where he refers to it as ""the mud wall called the Fort"". In Joel Gascoyne's survey of the parish of Stepney (1703) it is called The Dunghill: it is at least 400 yards long, and is crossed not only by a path, but a road. In John Rocque's map of London (1746) it has been horizontally truncated, but is shown with substantial elevation, with at least one dwelling-house – if not a terrace of houses – on its western end."
 Location , On maps ,"In Richard Blome's map of 1755 it has a large dwelling-house with front drive and appears alongside the newly built London Hospital. In John Cary's 1795 map its western portion has been truncated by the newly built New Road, but appears to have a substantial building in its northwest corner."
 Possible origins , Civil War fortification ,"In 1643 London was hastily fortified against the Royalist armies, for ""there is terrible news that [Prince] Rupert will sack it and so a complete and sufficient dike and earthern wall and bulwarks must be made"".Twenty-three or 24 earthen forts were built at intervals around the city and its main suburbs; neighbouring forts were in sight of one another. These forts were manned by volunteers e.g. men too old to be in the regular militia; local innkeepers were ordered to provide them with food."
 Possible origins , Civil War fortification ,"The forts were interconnected by an earth bank and trench, dug by ""great numbers of men, women and young children"". All social classes joined in the labour: The completed ring was 18 miles in circumference. A visiting Scotsman walked it; it took him 12 hours.Fort No.2, officially a hornwork with two flanks, commanded the Whitechapel Road."
 Possible origins , Civil War fortification ,"The Scottish traveller, who inspected it, said it was a ""nine angled fort only pallosaded and single ditched and planted with seven pieces of brazen ordnance [brass cannon], and a court du guard [guardhouse] composed of timber and thatched with tyle stone as all the rest are"". There was a trench around its base.Daniel Lysons said the earthwork at Whitechapel was 329 foot long, 182 foot broad and more than 25 foot above ground level.After the civil war these fortifications were swiftly removed because they spoiled productive agricultural land. However traces remained and one of these was Whitechapel Mount."
 Possible origins , Civil War fortification ,"Wrote Lysons (1811): ""The east end was till of late years very perfect; on the west side some houses had been built. The surface on the top, except where it had been dug away, was perfectly level. Mount Street, Mayfair, is another relict name of one of these civil war forts."
 Possible origins , Great Plague burial ground ,"In the bubonic epidemic of 1665 an estimated 70,000-100,000 Londoners died of the plague. Aldgate, Whitechapel and Stepney were badly affected. This placed a strain on the burial facilities and some were buried in mass graves.Official mass graves were made by opening a deep pit and leaving it open for as long as it took to fill with cadavers, which was done downwind. The number of lost plague pits in London is commonly exaggerated — most mass graves were actually in pre-existing churchyards . However there were some gaps in the records and ""undoubtedly some temporary and irregular plague burial sites""."
 Possible origins , Great Plague burial ground ,"Those willing to man the dead carts (and dispose of the corpses) were not fastidious; a contemporary said they were ‘very idle base liveing men and very rude"", drawing attention to their task by swearing and cursing.No contemporaneous record confirms corpses were officially buried in Whitechapel Mount. It is known that there were several burial grounds or plague pits in the vicinity e.g. across the road. Whether the mound was used as a burial ground has been disputed. According to popular tradition, it was."
 Possible origins , Great Plague burial ground ,"In one version, Whitechapel Mount's origin was that rubble from the Fire of London was thrown over a plague pit to cover it up. These rumours were denied by the authorities when they proposed to remove Whitechapel Mount; they had it ""pierced"" in an effort to refute them."
 Possible origins , Great Plague burial ground ,"The clearest reputable source is the author Joseph Moser, who wrote In the course of last summer [1802], when part of the rubbish of [Whitechapel Mount] had just been removed, I had the curiosity to inspect the place, and observed in the different strata a great number of human bones, together with those, apparently, of different animals, oxen, or cows, and sheep’s horns, bricks, tiles, &c."
 Possible origins , Great Plague burial ground ,"The bones and other exuvia of animals were in many places, especially towards the bottom, bedded in a stiff, viscid earth, of the blueish colour and consistence of potter's clay, which was unquestionably the original ground, thrown into different directions, as different interments operated upon its surface. A complication is that the London Hospital itself may have used the Mount for burials: a hospital history says that by 1764 ""The Mount Burying Ground was full""."
 Possible origins , Great Fire detritus ,"The Great Fire of London occurred the year after the plague. The nearest burnt environment was a mile away. Even so, respectable sources asserted that Whitechapel Mount was formed or augmented from rubble from the Fire of London, including Dr Markham the rector of Whitechapel Church, who took pains to investigate the subject. This origin theory was widely believed, though some denied it. When the Mount was dismantled in the 19th century the belief attracted flocks of antique hunters; see below."
 Possible origins , Laystall ,"The above theories about the origin of Whitechapel Mount, by themselves, may not account for its sheer size as shown in the maps and illustrations cited. A laystall was an open rubbish tip; towns relied on them for disposing of garbage, and did so until the sanitary landfills of the 20th century. By legislation of October 1671 seven laystalls were appointed for the City of London. All street sweepings and household rubbish was to be collected in carts and had to be tipped in one of these, and nowhere else."
 Possible origins , Laystall ,"One of them was Whitechapel Mount: it was to receive the rubbish from the wards of Portsoken, Tower, Duke's Place and Lime Street. However, a laystall was more than a passive tip: it was a business. Its proprietor employed gangs of men, women and boys to sort the rubbish and recycle it. Without him, nothing prevented indiscriminate fly-tipping and random lateral spread onto adjoining properties."
 Possible origins , Laystall ,"William Guy who investigated the laystalls of mid-19th century London reported In most of the laystalls or dustmen's yards, every species of refuse matter is collected and deposited:– nightsoil, the decomposing refuse of markets, the sweepings of narrow streets and courts, the sour-smelling grains from breweries, the surface soil of the leading thoroughfares, and the ashes from the houses. The proportion in which these several matters are collected, vary..."
 Possible origins , Laystall ,"In all these establishments the bulk of the deposits consists of dust from the houses, which is sifted on the spot by women and boys seated on the dust-heaps, assisted by men who are engaged in filling the sieves, sorting the heterogeneous materials, or removing and carting them away. While the legislation speaks of ""dung, soil, filth and dirt"", most domestic refuse (by volume) comprised household dust typically coal ash – hence the expression ""dustman"" – and this could be used for making bricks."
 Possible origins , Laystall ,"At the close of the 18th century there was a tremendous demand for bricks to build the rapidly expanding London; ""At night, a 'ring of fire' and pungent smoke encircled the City""; there were numerous local brickfields e.g. at Mile End. An Old Bailey case of 1809 records that bricks were being delivered from the diminishing Whitechapel Mount. The construction of the East and West India Docks early in the nineteenth century caused roads to be made through the low marshy fields extending from Shadwell and Ratcliff to Whitechapel."
 Possible origins , Laystall ,"New Street/Cannon Street Road, leading from Whitechapel Mount to St George in the East so increased the value of the land on each side of it, that the Corporation of London decided to take down the Mount. This occurred in 1807–8, and Mount Place, Mount Terrace, and Mount Street were then built on that site, thus marking the spot where the Mount stood.The process took several years, efforts at first being desultory."
 Possible origins , Laystall ,"There was even a proposal – a prefiguring of the Regent's Canal – to bring a canal from Paddington to the docks at Wapping by passing through Whitechapel Mount.The soil of the Mount was used to make bricks, see above, and these were delivered to e.g. Wentworth Street, Bethnal Green and ""Hanbury's Brewhouse"" (the Black Eagle Brewery), buildings that stand today."
 Removal , Antique hunters ,"Believing it to contain detritus from the Fire of London, flocks of cockney enthusiasts examined the Mount's soil. Various antiques were found in it – or alleged to be found in it, since it gave them provenance – including a silver tankard and a Roman coin.The most spectacular find was a carved boar's head with silver tusks; it was, said reputable antiquarians, an authentic memento of the Boar's Head Inn, Eastcheap: a setting for Shakespeare plays, Falstaff, Mistress Quickly and so forth, and genuinely burnt down in the Fire of London."
 Removal , Antique hunters ,"For lack of access, there has been no systematic archaeological investigation of the site. However, redevelopment of the Royal London Hospital has allowed occasional glimpses. Mackinder (1994), London Hospital Medical College, Newark Building, Grid Reference TQ3456815: Evaluation produced evidence of a deep cut feature on the alignment of the English Civil War defences. A subsequent excavation found the feature to be a ditch, 5.5m wide and 1.4m deep, filled with waterlain silts (the earliest dating to the 17th century), which was backfilled in the late 18th century. Other activity consisted of an undated drainage channel."
 Removal , Antique hunters ,"Later, there were two post holes possibly forming a fence-line and possibly associated with a rutted gravel surface that post-dated the infilling of the ditch. A large quantity of post-medieval red ware sugar cone moulds and collecting jars were recovered from the infilling of the ditch and later levelling of the site. Aitken (2005), The Front Green, Royal London Hospital, Grid Reference TQ347816: Post-medieval deposits, ashy fill deposits were recorded below the cellars of former terrace houses facing Whitechapel Road."
 Removal , Antique hunters ,"Extensive fill deposits may indicate quarrying, which took place after a successful petition to flatten the Mount fort by the hospital authorities at the end of the 18th century. There is no trace of a former burial ground on the site prior to that date and no disturbed graves or disarticulated human bone was recovered. A rise in the ground level to a metre above that of the surrounding Whitechapel and New Roads indicates a topographic replacement of the Mount as an elevated feature and the same rise is reflected along the 19th century Mount Terrace."
 Removal , Antique hunters ,"No significant archaeological deposits were observed. The Skeleton Witness: or, The Murder at the Mound by William Leman Rede was a play performed on the English and American stage. The villain does a murder and conceals the body in Whitechapel Mount. The crime is done in such a way that, should the remains be discovered, the impoverished hero will get the blame, though innocent. The hero goes abroad for seven years and makes his fortune."
 Removal , Antique hunters ,"On his return to London, about to marry the heroine, he learns, to his horror, that the Mount is to be cleared away, digging to start on the morrow. To stop this, he hurries off to the Mount's owner and buys it at an extravagant price. The vendor, suspicious, wonders if the Mount contains a buried treasure and sends some men to poke around. They discover the skeleton."
 Removal , Antique hunters ,"By a complicated plot twist the hero proves his innocence and gets the girl, both living happily ever after.The Mount was used as a metonymy to denote the east end or extremity of London town, as in ""from the farthest extent of Whitechapel mount to the utmost limits of St Giles"", or ""[the news] was all over town, from Hyde Park Corner to Whitechapel dunghill"".

 Terminology ,,"The word garbage originally meant chicken giblets and other entrails, as can be seen in the 15th century Boke of Kokery, which has a recipe for Garbage.What constitutes garbage is highly subjective, with some individuals or societies tending to discard things that others find useful or restorable. The words garbage, refuse, rubbish, trash, and waste are generally treated as interchangeable when used to describe ""substances or objects which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard"". Some of these terms have historic distinctions that are no longer present."
 Terminology ,,"In the 1880s, material to be disposed of was divided into four general categories: ashes (derived from the burning of coal or wood), garbage, rubbish, and street-sweepings. This scheme of categorization reduced some of these terms to more specific concepts: Garbage, the technical term for putrescent organic matter such as kitchen or food scraps, was fed to pigs and other livestock or boiled down in a process known as “rendering,” to extract fats, oils, and greases for manufacturing lubricants, or allowed to dry to become commercial fertilizer."
 Terminology ,,"Rubbish, a broad category of dry goods including boxes, bottles, tin cans, or virtually anything made from wood, metal, glass, and cloth, could be transformed into new consumer products through a variety of reclamation methods. The distinction between terms used to describe wet and dry discarded material ""was important in the days when cities slopped garbage to pigs, and needed to have the wet material separated from the dry"", but has since dissipated."
 Terminology ,,"In urban areas, garbage of all kinds is collected and treated as municipal solid waste; garbage that is discarded in ways that cause it to end up in the environment, rather than in containers or facilities designed to receive garbage, is considered litter. Litter is a form of garbage that has been improperly disposed of, and which therefore enters the environment. Notably, however, only a small fraction of garbage that is generated becomes litter, with the vast majority being disposed of in ways intended to secure it from entering the environment."
 Terminology ,,"Humans have been creating garbage throughout history, beginning with bone fragments left over from using animal parts and stone fragments discarded from toolmaking. The degree to which groups of early humans began engaging in agriculture can be estimated by examining the type and quality of animal bones in their garbage. Garbage from prehistoric or pre-civilization humans was often collected into mounds called middens, which might contain things such as ""a mix of discarded food, charcoal, shell tools, and broken pottery"". Garbology (study of modern refuse and trash) Landfill"
 History ,,"The integration of shallow oxidisation ponds of microalgae was demonstrated by Golueke & Oswald in the 1960s. The widespread global implementation of these systems can be largely credited to Prof George Lai Chan-Yu-Thim (02 March 1924 Mauritius-08 October 2016 Mauritius) from ZERI. Zero waste agriculture is now practiced in China (ecological farming), Columbia (integrated food & waste management systems) & Fiji (integrated farming systems), India (integrated biogas farming), South Africa (BEAT Coop & African Agroecological Biotechnology Initiative) and Mauritius."
 History ,,"The Brazilian government has adopted integrated farming system as a major social technology for the uplifting of marginalized and subsistence farmers through coordination with TECPAR.Zero waste agriculture combines mature ecological farming practices that delivers an integrated balance of job creation, poverty relief, food security, energy security, water conservation, climate change relief, land security & stewardship. Zero waste agriculture is optimally practiced on small 1-5 ha sized family owned and managed farms and it complements traditional farming & animal husbandry as practiced in most third world communities. Zero Waste Agriculture also preserves local indigenous systems and existing agrarian cultural values and practices."
 History ,,"Zero waste agriculture presents a balance of economically, socially and ecologically benefits as it: optimizes food production in an ecological sound manner reduces water consumption through recycling and reduced evaporation provides energy security through the harvesting of biomethane (biogas) and the extraction of biodiesel from micro-algae, as a by-product of food production provides climate change relief through the substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from both traditional agriculture practices and fossil fuel usage reduces the use of pesticides through biodiverse farmingCertification of such farming practices is both challenging and an opportunity."

 Definition ,,"Food loss and waste occurs at all stages of the food supply chain – production, processing, sales, and consumption. Definitions of what constitutes food loss versus food waste or what parts of foods (i.e., inedible parts) exit the food supply chain are considered lost or wasted vary. Terms are often defined on a situational basis (as is the case more generally with definitions of waste). Professional bodies, including international organizations, state governments, and secretariats may use their own definitions."
 Definition , United Nations ,"The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations defines food loss and waste as the decrease in quantity or quality of food along the food supply chain. Within this framework, UN Agencies distinguish loss and waste at two different stages in the process: Food loss occurs along the food supply chain from harvest/slaughter/catch up to, but not including, the sales level Food waste occurs at the retail and consumption level.Important components of this definition include: Food redirected to nonfood chains (including animal feed, compost, or recovery to bioenergy) is not counted as food loss or waste."
 Definition , United Nations ,"Inedible parts are not considered as food loss or waste (these inedible parts are sometimes referred to as unavoidable food waste)Under Sustainable Development Goal 12, the Food and Agriculture Organization is responsible for measuring food loss, while the UN Environmental Program measures food waste."
 Definition , European Union ,"In the European Union (EU), food waste is defined by combining the definitions of food and waste, namely: ""any substance or product, whether processed, partially processed or unprocessed, intended to be, or reasonably expected to be ingested by humans (...)"" (including things such as drinks and chewing gum; excluding things such as feed, medicine, cosmetics, tobacco products, and narcotic or psychotropic substances) ""which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard"".: 2–3 Previously, food waste was defined by directive 75/442/EEC as ""any food substance, raw or cooked, which is discarded, or intended or required to be discarded"" in 1975."
 Definition , European Union ,"In 2006, 75/442/EEC was repealed by 2006/12/EC, which defined waste as ""any substance or object in the categories set out in Annex I which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard""."

(2017) compared four definitions from:: 4 a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 2016 report: ""Food loss is defined as ‘the decrease in quantity or quality of food.’ Food waste is part of food loss and refers to discarding or alternative (nonfood) use of food that is safe and nutritious for human consumption along the entire food supply chain, from primary production to end household consumer level""; an Economic Research Service (ERS; a USDA agency) 2014 report: ""Food loss represents the amount of food postharvest, that is available for human consumption but is not consumed for any reason."

 Definition , Other definitions ,"Pre-consumer food generated during the manufacturing and packaging of food products is not included in EPA's food waste estimates.""According to Bellemare et al., the inclusion of food that goes to nonfood productive use is flawed for two reasons: ""First, if recovered food is used as an input, such as animal feed, fertilizer, or biomass to produce output, then by definition it is not wasted. However, there might be economic losses if the cost of recovered food is higher than the average cost of inputs in the alternative, nonfood use."
 Definition , Other definitions ,"Second, the definition creates practical problems for measuring food waste because the measurement requires tracking food loss in every stage of the supply chain and its proportion that flows to nonfood uses."": 4 They argued that only food that ends up in landfills should be counted as food waste, pointing to the 2016 EPA definition as a good example.: 4 Bellemare et al. also noted that ""the FAO and ERS definitions only apply to edible and safe and nutritious food, whereas the definitions of FUSIONS and the EPA apply to both edible and inedible parts of food."
 Definition , Other definitions ,"Finally, the ERS and EPA definitions of food waste exclude the food that is not harvested at the farm level."": 4 A 2019 FAO report stated: 'The notion of food being lost or wasted is deceptively simple, but in practice there is no commonly agreed definition of food loss and waste. FAO has worked towards the harmonization of concepts related to food loss and waste, and the definitions adopted in this report are the result of a consensus reached in consultation with experts in this field."
 Definition , Other definitions ,"This report understands food loss and waste as the decrease in quantity or quality of food along the food supply chain. Empirically it considers food losses as occurring along the food supply chain from harvest/slaughter/catch up to, but not including, the retail level. Food waste, on the other hand, occurs at the retail and consumption level. This definition also aligns with the distinction implicit in SDG Target 12.3. This report also asserts that, although there may be an economic loss, food diverted to other economic uses, such as animal feed, is not considered as quantitative food loss or waste."
 Definition , Other definitions ,"Similarly, inedible parts are not considered as food loss or waste.': 9–10"
 Definition , Methodology ,"The 2019 FAO report stated: ""Food loss and waste has typically been measured in physical terms using tonnes as reporting units. This measurement fails to account for the economic value of different commodities and can risk attributing a higher weight to low-value products just because they are heavier. [This] report acknowledges this by adopting a measure that accounts for the economic value of produce."": 10 Hall et al."
 Definition , Methodology ,"(2009) calculated food waste in the United States in terms of energy value ""by comparing the US food supply data with the calculated food consumed by the US population."" The result was that food waste among American consumers increased from ""about 30% of the available food supply in 1974 to almost 40% in recent years"" (the early 2000s), or about 900 kcal per person per day (1974) to about 1400 kcal per person per day (2003). A 2012 Natural Resources Defense Council report interpreted this to mean that Americans threw away up to 40% of food that was safe to eat."
 Definition , Methodology ,"Buzby & Hyman (2012) estimated both the total weight (in kg and lbs) and monetary value (in USD) of food loss in the United States, concluding that 'the annual value of food loss is almost 10% of the average amount spent on food per consumer in 2008'."
 Sources , Production ,"In the United States, food loss can occur at most stages of the food industry and in significant amounts. In subsistence agriculture, the amounts of food loss are unknown, but are likely to be insignificant by comparison, due to the limited stages at which loss can occur, and given that food is grown for projected need as opposed to a global marketplace demand."
 Sources , Production ,"Nevertheless, on-farm losses in storage in developing countries, particularly in African countries, can be high although the exact nature of such losses is much debated.In the food industry of the United States, the food supply of which is the most diverse and abundant of any country in the world, loss occurs from the beginning of food production chain. From planting, crops can be subjected to pest infestations and severe weather, which cause losses before harvest. Since natural forces (e.g. temperature and precipitation) remain the primary drivers of crop growth, losses from these can be experienced by all forms of outdoor agriculture."
 Sources , Production ,"On average, farms in the United States lose up to six billion pounds of crops every year because of these unpredictable conditions. According to the IPCC sixth assessment report, encouraging the development of technologies that address issues in food harvesting and post-harvesting could have a significant impact on decreasing food waste in the supply chain early-on.The use of machinery in harvesting can cause loss, as harvesters may be unable to discern between ripe and immature crops, or collect only part of a crop."
 Sources , Production ,"Economic factors, such as regulations and standards for quality and appearance, also cause food waste; farmers often harvest selectively, preferring to leave crops not to standard in the field (where they can be used as fertilizer or animal feed), since they would otherwise be discarded later. This method of removing undesirable produce from harvest collection, distribution sites and grocery stores is called culling. However, usually when culling occurs at the production, food processing, retail and consumption stages, it is to remove or dispose of produce with a strange or imperfect appearance rather than produce that is spoiled or unsafe to eat."
 Sources , Production ,"In urban areas, fruit and nut trees often go unharvested because people either do not realize that the fruit is edible or they fear that it is contaminated, despite research which shows that urban fruit is safe to consume."
 Sources , Food processing ,"Food loss continues in the post-harvest stage, but the amounts of post-harvest loss involved are relatively unknown and difficult to estimate.: 1 Regardless, the variety of factors that contribute to food loss, both biological/environmental and socio-economical, would limit the usefulness and reliability of general figures.: 1, 7–8 In storage, considerable quantitative losses can be attributed to pests and micro-organisms. This is a particular problem for countries that experience a combination of heat (around 30 °C) and ambient humidity (between 70 and 90 per cent), as such conditions encourage the reproduction of insect pests and micro-organisms."
 Sources , Food processing ,"Losses in the nutritional value, caloric value and edibility of crops, by extremes of temperature, humidity or the action of micro-organisms, also account for food waste. Further losses are generated in the handling of food and by shrinkage in weight or volume.Some of the food loss produced by processing can be difficult to reduce without affecting the quality of the finished product.: 3 Food safety regulations are able to claim foods that contradict standards before they reach markets."
 Sources , Food processing ,"Although this can conflict with efforts to reuse food loss (such as in animal feed), safety regulations are in place to ensure the health of the consumer; they are vitally important, especially in the processing of foodstuffs of animal origin (e.g. meat and dairy products), as contaminated products from these sources can lead to and are associated with microbiological and chemical hazards."
 Sources , Retail ,"Packaging protects food from damage during its transportation from farms and factories via warehouses to retailing, as well as preserving its freshness upon arrival. Although it avoids considerable food waste, packaging can compromise efforts to reduce food waste in other ways, such as by contaminating waste that could be used for animal feedstocks with plastics.In 2013, the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) performed research that suggests that the leading cause of food waste in America is due to uncertainty over food expiration dates, such as confusion in deciphering best-before, sell-by, or use-by dates."
 Sources , Retail ,"Joined by Harvard's Food Law and Policy Clinic, the NRDC produced a study called The Dating Game: How Confusing Food Date Labels Leads to Food Waste in America. This United States-based study looked at the intertwining laws which lead labeling to end up unclear and erratic. This uncertainty leads to consumers to toss food, most often because they think the food may be unsafe or misunderstand the labeling on the food completely. Lack of regulation on labeling can result in large quantities of food being removed from the market overall.Retail stores throw away large quantities of food."
 Sources , Retail ,"Usually, this consists of items that have reached either their best-before, sell-by, or use-by dates. Some stores make an effort to markdown these goods with systems like discount stickers, stores have widely varying policies to handle the excess food. Much of the food discarded by stores is still edible. Some stores put effort into preventing access to poor or homeless people, while others work with charitable organization to distribute food. Retailers also contribute to waste as a result of their contractual arrangements with suppliers. Failure to supply agreed quantities renders farmers or processors liable to have their contracts cancelled."
 Sources , Retail ,"As a consequence, they plan to produce more than actually required to meet the contract, to have a margin of error. Surplus production is often simply disposed of.Retailers usually have strict cosmetic standards for produce, and if fruits or vegetables are misshapen or superficially bruised, they are often not put on the shelf. In the United States, some of the estimated six billion pounds of produce wasted each year are discarded because of appearance. The USDA publishes guidelines used as a baseline assessment by produce distributors, grocery stores, restaurants and other consumers in order to rate the quality of food."
 Sources , Retail ,"These guidelines and how they rate are readily available on their website. For example, apples get graded by their size, color, wax residue, firmness, and skin appearance. If apples rank highly in these categories and show close to no superficial defects, they are rated as ""U.S. Extra Fancy"" or ""U.S. Fancy"", these are the typical ratings sought out by grocery stores when purchasing their produce. Any apples with suboptimal levels of appearance are ranked as either ""U.S. Number 1"" or ""Utility"" and are not normally purchased for retail, as recommended by produce marketing sources, despite being safe and edible."
 Sources , Retail ,"A number of regional programs and organizations have been established by the EPA and USDA in an attempt to reduce such produce waste. Organizations in other countries, such as Good & Fugly in Australia and No Food Waste in India, are making similar efforts worldwide."
 Sources , Retail ,"The popular trend of selling ""imperfect"" produce at retail has been criticized for overlooking existing markets for these foods (eg the food processing industry and bargain grocery stores) and downplaying the household-level wasting of food that is statistically a larger part of the overall problem.The fishing industry wastes substantial amounts of food: about 40–60% of fish caught in Europe is discarded as the wrong size or wrong species. This comes to about 2.3 million tonnes per annum in the North Atlantic and the North Sea."
 Sources , Food-service industry ,"Addressing food waste requires involving multiple stakeholders throughout the food supply chain, which is a market-driven system. Each stakeholder and their food waste quantification can be dependent on geographical scales. This geographical scale then results in the production of different definitions of food waste, as mentioned earlier, with respect to the complexities of food supply chains and then create a narrative that further shows the needs for specific research on important stakeholders. The food service industry suggests to be a key stakeholder to achieve mitigation."
 Sources , Food-service industry ,"The key players within the food service industry include the manufacturers, producers, farmers, managers, employees, and consumers. The key factors relating to food waste in restaurants include the food menu, the production procedure, the use of pre-prepared versus whole food products, dinnerware size, type of ingredients used, the dishes served, opening hours, and disposal methods."
 Sources , Food-service industry ,"These factors then can be categorized in the different stages of operations that relate to pre-kitchen, kitchen-based, and post-kitchen processes.In restaurants in developing countries, the lack of infrastructure and associated technical and managerial skills in food production have been identified as the key drivers in the creation of food waste currently and in the future. Comparatively, the majority of food waste in developed countries tends to be produced post-consumer, which is driven by the low prices of food, greater disposable income, consumers' high expectations of food cosmetic standards, and the increasing disconnect between consumers and how food is being produced (Urbanization)."
 Sources , Food-service industry ,"That being said, in United States restaurants alone, an estimated 22 to 33 billion pounds are wasted each year.Serving plate size reduction has been identified as an intervention effective at reducing restaurant food waste. Under such interventions, restaurants decrease the size of plates for meals provided to diners. Similar interventions which have been found to be effective at reducing restaurant food waste include utilizing reusable rather than disposable plates and decreasing serving size."
 Sources , Consumption ,"Consumers are directly and indirectly responsible for wasting a lot of food, which could for a large part be avoided if they were willing to accept suboptimal food (SOF) that deviates in sensory characteristics (odd shapes, discolorations) or has a best-before date that is approaching or has passed, but is still perfectly fine to eat. In addition to inedible and edible food waste generated by consumers, substantial amounts of food is wasted through food overconsumption, also referred to as metabolic food waste, estimated globally as 10% of foods reaching the consumer."
 Extent , Global extent ,"Efforts are underway by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to measure progress towards SDG Target 12.3 through two separate indices: the Food Loss Index (FLI) and the Food Waste Index (FWI).According to FAO's The State of Food and Agriculture 2019, globally, in 2016, around 14 percent of the world's food is lost from production before reaching the retail level. Generally, levels of loss are higher for fruits and vegetables than for cereals and pulses."
 Extent , Global extent ,"However, even for the latter, significant levels are found in sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, while they are limited in Central and Southern Asia.Estimates from UN Environment's Food Waste Index suggest that about 931 million tonnes of food, or 17 percent of total food available to consumers in 2019, went into the waste bins of households, retailers, restaurants and other food services.According to a report from Feedback EU, the EU wastes 153 million tonnes of food each year, around double previous estimates."
 Extent , Earlier estimates ,"In 2011, an FAO publication based on studies carried out by The Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology (SIK) found that the total of global amount of food loss and waste was around one third of the edible parts of food produced for human consumption, amounting to about 1.3 billion tonnes (1.28×109 long tons; 1.43×109 short tons) per year.: 4 As the following table shows, industrialized and developing countries differ substantially. In developing countries, it is estimated that 400–500 calories per day per person are wasted, while in developed countries 1,500 calories per day per person are wasted."
 Extent , Earlier estimates ,"In the former, more than 40% of losses occur at the post-harvest and processing stages, while in the latter, more than 40% of losses occur at the retail and consumer levels."
 Extent , Earlier estimates ,"The total food waste by consumers in industrialized countries (222 million tonnes or 218,000,000 long tons or 245,000,000 short tons) is almost equal to the entire food production in sub-Saharan Africa (230 million tonnes or 226,000,000 long tons or 254,000,000 short tons).: 4 A 2013 report from the British Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IME) likewise estimated that 30–50% (or 1.2–2 billion tonnes or 1.18×109–1.97×109 long tons or 1.32×109–2.20×109 short tons ) of all food produced remains uneaten."
 Extent , Australia ,"Each year in New South Wales, more than 25 million meals are delivered by charity OzHarvest from food that would otherwise be wasted. Each year, the Australian economy loses $20 billion in food waste. This has a crucial environmental impact through the waste of resources used to produce, manufacture, package, and distribute that food.In addition, it is estimated that 7.6 million tonnes of CO2 is generated by the disposed food in landfills. It is also the cause of odour, leaching, and potential generation for diseases."
 Extent , Australia ,"In March 2019, the Australian ministry of the environment shared the key findings of Australia's National food waste baseline, which will facilitate the tracking of the progress towards their goal to halve Australian food waste by 2030.Many initiatives were taken by the Australian government in order to help achieve this goal. In fact, they financed $1.2 million in organization that invest in renewable energies systems to store and transport food. They also funded more than $10 million for research on food waste reduction."
 Extent , Australia ,"Local governments have also implemented programs such as information sessions on storing food and composting, diversion of waste from restaurants and cafes from landfills to shared recycling facilities and donation of food to organization that would otherwise be wasted."
 Extent , Canada ,"In Canada, 58% of all food is wasted, amounting to 35.5 million tonnes of food per annuum. The value of this lost food is equivalent to CA$21 billion. Such quantities of food would be enough to feed all Canadians for five months. It is estimated that about one third of this waste could be spared and sent to those in need. There are many factors that contribute to such large-scale waste. Manufacturing and processing food alone incur costs of CA$21 billion, or 4.82 million tons. Per household, it is estimated that $1,766 is lost in food loss and waste."
 Extent , Canada ,"The Government of Canada identifies three main factors contributing to household waste: (1) buying too much food and not eating it before it spoils, (2) malfunctioning or poorly-designed packaging that does not deter spoilage rates or contamination, and (3) improper disposing of food – using garbage bins instead of those intended for organic waste."
 Extent , Canada ,"Canada, Mexico, and the United States are working together under the Commission for Environmental Cooperation in order to address the severe problem of food waste in North America.Canada specifically is working in the following ways to reduce food waste: Canada pledged to consult on strategies in the Strategy on Short-lived Climate Pollutants to reduce avoidable food waste within the country. This will help to reduce methane emissions from Canadian landfills. The government has implemented a Food Policy for Canada, which is a movement towards a more sustainable food system."
 Extent , Canada ,"In February 2019, the government brought together several experts from different sectors to share ideas and discuss opportunities for measuring and reducing food loss and waste across the food supply chain.During the 2022 Quebec general election, Québec solidaire party spokesman Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois stated that ending food waste in Quebec would be a priority of the party if in government. The party seeks to cut food waste by 50% by mandating large businesses and institutions to give unsold food to groups that would distribute the food, or to businesses that would process the food."
 Extent , China ,"In 2015 the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported that in big cities there was 17 to 18 million tons of food waste, enough to feed over 30 million people. About 25% of the waste was staple foods and about 18% meat.In August 2020 the Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping said the amount of food waste was shocking and distressing."
 Extent , China ,"A local authority campaign ""Operation empty plate"" (Chinese: 光盘行动) was started to reduce waste, including encouraging food outlets to limit orders to one fewer main dish than the number of customers.As of December 2020, a draft law is under consideration to penalise food outlets if they encourage or mislead customers to order excessive meals causing obvious waste, first with a warning and then fines of up to 10,000 yuan. It would allow restaurants to charge customers who leave excessive leftovers. Broadcasters who promote overeating or food waste could also be fined up to 100,000 yuan."
 Extent , Denmark ,"According to Ministry of Environment (Denmark), over 700,000 tonnes per year of food is wasted every year in Denmark in the entire food value chain from farm to fork. Due to the work of activist Selina Juul's Stop Wasting Food movement, Denmark has achieved a national reduction in food waste by 25% in 5 years (2010–2015)."
 Extent , France ,"In France, approximately 1.3–1.9 million tonnes of food waste is produced every year, or between 20 and 30 kilograms per person per year. Out of the 10 million tonnes of food that is either lost or wasted in the country, 7.1 million tonnes of food wasted in the country, only 11% comes from supermarkets. Not only does this cost the French €16 billion per year, but also the negative impact on the environment is also shocking. In France, food waste emits 15.3 million tonnes of CO2, which represents 3% of the country's total CO2 emission."
 Extent , France ,"In response to this issue, in 2016, France became the first country in the world to pass a unanimous legislation that bans supermarkets from throwing away or destroying unsold food. Instead, supermarkets are expected to donate such food to charities and food banks. In addition to donating food, many businesses claim to prevent food waste by selling soon-to-be wasted products at discounted prices. The National Pact Against Food Waste in France has outlined eleven measures to achieve a food waste reduction by half by 2025."
 Extent , Hungary ,"According to the research of National Food Chain Safety Office in 2019 based on the official EU methodological framework, an average Hungarian consumer generates 68 kg food waste annually. 49% of this amount would be avoidable. The research team (Wasteless project) replicated the study in 2019 involving 165 households. According to the data, food waste generated by the Hungarian households was estimated to be 65.5 kg per capita annually. Between the two periods, a 4% decrease was observed, despite significant economic expansion. In 2021, The Fidesz government of Viktor Orbán passed a law dealing with food waste."
 Extent , Italy ,"According to REDUCE project, which produced the first baseline dataset for Italy based on official EU methodological framework, food waste is 530 g per person per week at household stage (only edible fraction); food waste in school canteens corresponds to 586 g per pupil per week; retail food waste per capita, per year corresponds to 2.9 kg.

 Extent , Netherlands ,"least €4.4bn.': 15 In 2019, three studies into food waste in households in the Netherlands commissioned by the LNV were conducted, showing that the average household waste per capita had been reduced from 48 kilograms of ""solid food (including dairy products, fats, sauces and soups)"" in 2010, to 41.2 kilograms in 2016, to 34.3 kilograms in 2019.: 3–4 The waste of liquid foods (excluding beer and wine, first measured in 2019) that ended up in the sewer through sinks or toilets was analysed to have decreased from 57.3 litres per capita in 2010 to 45.5 litres in 2019.: 3–4, 7"
 Extent , New Zealand ,Research done on household food waste in New Zealand found that larger households and households with more young people created more food waste. The average household in this case study put 40% of food waste into the rubbish.
 Extent , Singapore ,"In Singapore, 788,600 tonnes (776,100 long tons; 869,300 short tons) of food was wasted in 2014. Of that, 101,400 tonnes (99,800 long tons; 111,800 short tons) were recycled. Since Singapore has limited agriculture ability, the country spent about S$14.8 billion (US$10.6 billion) on importing food in 2014. US$1.4 billion of it ends up being wasted, or 13 percent.On January 1, 2020, Singapore implemented the Zero Waste Masterplan which aims to reduce Singapore's daily waste production by 30 percent. The project also aims to extend the lifespan of the Semaku Landfill, Singapore's only landfill, beyond 2025."
 Extent , Singapore ,"As a direct result of the project, food waste dropped to 665,000 tonnes, showing a significant decrease from 2017's all-time high of 810,000 tonnes."
 Extent , United Kingdom ,"In the UK, 6,700,000 tonnes (6,590,000 long tons; 7,390,000 short tons) per year of wasted food (purchased and edible food which is discarded) amounts to a cost of £10.2 billion each year. This represents costs of £250 to £400 a year per household."
 Extent , United States ,"Estimates of food waste in the United States range from 35 million tons to 103 million tons. In a study done by National Geographic in 2014, Elizabeth Royte indicated more than 30 percent of food in the United States, valued at $162 billion annually, is not eaten. The University of Arizona conducted a study in 2004 that indicated that 14% to 15% of United States edible food is untouched or unopened, amounting to $43 billion worth of discarded, but edible, food."
 Extent , United States ,"In 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture came forth with estimations from the Economic Research Service that approximates food waste in the United States to be equivalent to 141 trillion calories.USDA data from 2010 shows that 26% of fish, meat, and poultry were thrown away at the retail and consumer level. Since then, meat production has increased by more than 10%. Data scientist Harish Sethu says this means that billions of animals are raised and slaughtered only to end up in a landfill."
 Extent , United States ,"Empirical evidence at the global level on the environmental footprints for major commodity groups suggests that, if the aim is to reduce land use, the primary focus should be on meat and animal products, which account for 60 percent of the land footprint associated with food loss and waste. If the aim is to target water scarcity, cereals and pulses make the largest contribution (more than 70 percent), followed by fruits and vegetables."
 Extent , United States ,"In terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with food loss and waste, the biggest contribution is again from cereals and pulses (more than 60 percent), followed by roots, tubers and oil-bearing crops. However, the environmental footprint for different commodities also varies across regions and countries, due, among other things, to differences in crop yields and production techniques. According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, the reduction of food waste would be beneficial for improving availability of resources such as ""water, land-use, energy consumption"" and the overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere."
 Extent , United States ,"In 2022 United Nations Biodiversity Conference nations adopted an agreement for preserving biodiversity, including a commitment to reduce food waste by 50% by the year 2030.According to FAO's The State of Food and Agriculture 2019, the case for reducing food loss and waste includes gains that society can reap but which individual actors may not take into account, namely: (i) increased productivity and economic growth; (ii) improved food security and nutrition; and (iii) mitigation of environmental impacts of losing and wasting food, in particular terms of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG emissions as well as lowering pressure on land and water resources."
 Extent , United States ,"The last two societal gains, in particular, are typically seen as externalities of reducing food loss and waste.Response to the problem of food waste at all social levels has varied hugely, including campaigns from advisory and environmental groups, and concentrated media attention on the subject.As suggested by the food waste hierarchy, prevention and reuse pathways for human consumption have the highest priority levels for food waste treatment. The general approach to food waste reduction comprise two main pathways: prevention and valorisation."
 Extent , United States ,"Prevention of food waste infers all actions that reduce food production and ultimately prevent food from being produced in vain, such as food donations or re-processing into new food products. Valorisation on the other hand comprise actions that recover the materials, nutrients or energy in food waste, for instance by producing animal feed, fuel or energy. Multiple studies have studied the environmental benefits of food waste prevention measures, including food donations, recovery of unharvested vegetables for re-use in food production, re-processing of surplus bread for beer production, and producing chutney or juice from leftovers."
 Extent , United States ,"Food waste can also be used to produce multiple high-value products, such as a fish oil substitute for food or feed use via marine micro algae, without compromising the ability to produce energy via biogas. The general consensus currently suggest that reducing food waste by either prevention or valorisation, for human consumption, infers higher environmental benefits compared to the lower priority levels, such as energy production or disposal."
 Extent , United States ,"Multiple private enterprises have developed hardware and software solutions dealing mainly with the prevention of food waste within foodservice production facilities (contract catering, hotels & resorts, cruise ships, casinos etc.), by gathering quantitative and qualitative data about the specific food waste, helping chefs and managers reduce food waste by up to 70% by improving and optimising their workflows and menus."
 Prevention and valorisation , Food rescue ,"There are multiple initiatives that rescue food that would otherwise not be consumed by humans anymore. The food can come from supermarkets, restaurants or private households for example. Such initiatives are: food banks, online platforms like Too Good To Go and Olio, public foodsharing shelves like those from foodsharing.de and dumpster diving."
 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"One way of dealing with food waste is to reduce its creation. Consumers can reduce spoilage by planning their food shopping, avoiding potentially wasteful spontaneous purchases, and storing foods properly (and also preventing a too large buildup of perishable stock). Widespread educational campaigns have been shown to be an effective way to reduce food waste.A British campaign called ""Love Food, Hate Waste"" has raised awareness about preventative measures to address food waste for consumers."

 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"storage and preparation and in-store education, the UK observed a 21% decrease in avoidable household food waste over the course of 5 years.Another potential solution is for ""smart packaging"" which would indicate when food is spoiled more precisely than expiration dates currently do, for example with temperature-sensitive ink, plastic that changes color when exposed to oxygen, or gels that change color with time.An initiative in Curitiba, Brazil called Cambio Verde allows farmers to provide surplus produce (produce they would otherwise discard due to too low prices) to people that bring glass and metal to recycling facilities (to encourage further waste reduction)."
 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"In Europe, the Food Surplus Entrepreneurs Network (FSE Network), coordinates a network of social businesses and nonprofit initiatives with the goal to spread best practices to increase the use of surplus food and reduction of food waste.An overarching consensus exists on the substantial environmental benefits of food waste reduction. However, rebound effects may cause substitutive consumption as a result of economic savings made from food waste prevention, potentially offsetting more than half of the avoided emissions (depending on the type of food and price elasticities involved)."
 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"In areas where the waste collection is a public function, food waste is usually managed by the same governmental organization as other waste collection. Most food waste is combined with general waste at the source. Separate collections, also known as source-separated organics, have the advantage that food waste can be disposed of in ways not applicable to other wastes. In the United States, companies find higher and better uses for large commercial generators of food and beverage waste."
 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"From the end of the 19th century through the middle of the 20th century, many municipalities collected food waste (called ""garbage"" as opposed to ""trash"") separately. This was typically disinfected by steaming and fed to pigs, either on private farms or in municipal piggeries.Separate curbside collection of food waste is now being revived in some areas."
 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"To keep collection costs down and raise the rate of food waste segregation, some local authorities, especially in Europe, have introduced ""alternate weekly collections"" of biodegradable waste (including, e.g., garden waste), which enable a wider range of recyclable materials to be collected at reasonable cost, and improve their collection rates. However, they result in a two-week wait before the waste will be collected. The criticism is that particularly during hot weather, food waste rots and stinks, and attracts vermin. Waste container design is therefore essential to making such operations feasible."
 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"Curbside collection of food waste is also done in the U.S., some ways by combining food scraps and yard waste together. Several states in the U.S. have introduced a yard waste ban, not accepting leaves, brush, trimmings, etc. in landfills. Collection of food scraps and yard waste combined is then recycled and composted for reuse. As alternatives to landfill, food waste can be composted to produce soil and fertilizer, fed to animals or insects, or used to produce energy or fuel. Some wasted fruit parts, can also be biorefined to extract useful substances for the industry (i.e."
 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"succinic acid from orange peels, lycopene from tomato peels)."
 Disposal , Landfills and greenhouse gases ,"Dumping food waste in a landfill causes odour as it decomposes, attracts flies and vermin, and has the potential to add biological oxygen demand (BOD) to the leachate. The European Union Landfill Directive and Waste Regulations, like regulations in other countries, enjoin diverting organic wastes away from landfill disposal for these reasons."
 Disposal , Landfills and greenhouse gases ,"Starting in 2015, organic waste from New York City restaurants will be banned from landfills.In countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, food scraps constitute around 19% of the waste buried in landfills, where it biodegrades very easily and produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.Methane, or CH4, is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas that is released into the air, also produced by landfills in the U.S. Although methane spends less time in the atmosphere (12 years) than CO2, it's more efficient at trapping radiation."
 Disposal , Landfills and greenhouse gases ,It is 25 times greater to impact climate change than CO2 in a 100-year period. Humans accounts over 60% of methane emissions globally.
 Disposal , Fodder and insect feed ,"Large quantities of fish, meat, dairy and grain are discarded at a global scale annually, when they can be used for things other than human consumption. The feeding of food scraps or slop to domesticated animals such as pigs or chickens is, historically, the most common way of dealing with household food waste. The animals turn roughly two thirds of their ingested food into gas or fecal waste, while the last third is digested and repurposed as meat or dairy products. There are also different ways of growing produce and feeding livestock that could ultimately reduce waste."
 Disposal , Fodder and insect feed ,"Bread and other cereal products discarded from the human food chain could be used to feed chickens. Chickens have traditionally been given mixtures of waste grains and milling by-products in a mixture called chicken scratch. As well, giving table scraps to backyard chickens is a large part of that movement's claim to sustainability, though not all backyard chicken growers recommend it. Ruminants and pigs have also been fed bakery waste for a long time.Certain food waste (such as flesh) can also be used as feed in maggot farming. The maggots can then be fed to other animals."
 Disposal , Fodder and insect feed ,"In China, some food waste is being processed by feeding it to cockroaches."
 Disposal , Composting ,"Food waste can be biodegraded by composting, and reused to fertilize soil. Composting is the aerobic process completed by microorganisms in which the bacteria break down the food waste into simpler organic materials that can then be used in soil. By redistributing nutrients and high microbial populations, compost reduces water runoff and soil erosion by enhancing rainfall penetration, which has been shown to reduce the loss of sediment, nutrients, and pesticide losses to streams by 75–95%.Composting food waste leads to a decrease in the quantity of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere."
 Disposal , Composting ,"In landfills, organic food waste decomposes anaerobically, producing methane gas that is emitted into the atmosphere. When this biodegradable waste is composted, it decomposes aerobically and does not produce methane, but instead produces organic compost that can then be utilized in agriculture. Recently, the city of New York has begun to require that restaurants and food-producing companies begin to compost their leftover food."
 Disposal , Composting ,"Another instance of composting progress is a Wisconsin-based company called WasteCap, who is dedicated towards aiding local communities create composting plans.Municipal Food Waste (MFW) can be composted to create this product of organic fertilizer, and many municipalities choose to do this citing environmental protection and economic efficiency as reasoning. Transporting and dumping waste in landfills requires both money and room in the landfills that have very limited available space."
 Disposal , Composting ,"One municipality who chose to regulate MFW is San Francisco, who requires citizens to separate compost from trash on their own, instituting fines for non-compliance at $100 for individual homes and $500 for businesses. The city's economic reasoning for this controversial mandate is supported by their estimate that one business can save up to $30000 annually on garbage disposal costs with the implementation of the required composting."
 Disposal , Home composting ,"Composting is an economical and environmentally conscious step many homeowners could take to reduce their impact on landfill waste. Instead of food scraps and spoiled food taking up space in trashcans or stinking up the kitchen before the bag is full, it could be put outside and broken down by worms and added to garden beds."
 Disposal , Anaerobic digestion ,"Anaerobic digestion produces both useful gaseous products and a solid fibrous ""compostable"" material. Anaerobic digestion plants can provide energy from waste by burning the methane created from food and other organic wastes to generate electricity, defraying the plants' costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency states that the use of anaerobic composting allows for large amounts of food waste to avoid the landfills."
 Disposal , Anaerobic digestion ,"Instead of producing these greenhouse gasses into the environment from being in a landfill, the gasses can alternatively be harnessed in these facilities for reuse.Since this process of composting produces high volumes of biogas, there are potential safety issues such as explosion and poisoning. These interactions require proper maintenance and personal protective equipment is utilized. Certain U.S. states, such as Oregon, have implemented the requirement for permits on such facilities, based on the potential danger to the population and surrounding environment.Food waste coming through the sanitary sewers from garbage disposal units is treated along with other sewage and contributes to sludge."
 Disposal , Commercial liquid food waste ,"Commercially, food waste in the form of wastewater coming from commercial kitchens' sinks, dishwashers and floor drains is collected in holding tanks called grease interceptors to minimize flow to the sewer system. This often foul-smelling waste contains both organic and inorganic waste (chemical cleaners, etc.) and may also contain hazardous hydrogen sulfide gases. It is referred to as fats, oils, and grease (FOG) waste or more commonly ""brown grease"" (versus ""yellow grease"", which is fryer oil that is easily collected and processed into biodiesel) and is an overwhelming problem, especially in the US, for the aging sewer systems."
 Disposal , Commercial liquid food waste ,"Per the US EPA, sanitary sewer overflows also occur due to the improper discharge of FOGs to the collection system. Overflows discharge 3–10 billion U.S. gallons (11–38 million cubic meters) of untreated wastewater annually into local waterways, and up to 3,700 illnesses annually are due to exposure to contamination from sanitary sewer overflows into recreational waters.

 Cleanup ,,"Currently production still occurs in a third area, the Viburnum Trend, in southeastern Missouri. Mining and milling of ore produced more than 500 million tons of wastes in the tri-state area and about 250 million tons of wastes in the Old Lead Belt. More than 75 percent of this waste has been removed, with some portion of it used over the years. Today, approximately 100 million tons of chat remain in the tri-state area."
 Cleanup ,,"The EPA, the states of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri, local communities, and private companies continue to work together in implementing and monitoring response actions that reduce or remove potential adverse impacts posed by remaining mine wastes contaminated with lead, zinc, cadmium, and other metals. Ore production consisted of crushing and grinding the rock to standard sizes and separating the ore. Ore processing was accomplished in either a dry gravity separation or through a wet washing or flotation separation."
 Cleanup ,,Dry processes produced a fine gravel waste commonly called “chat.” The wet processes resulted in the creation of tailing ponds used to dispose of waste material after ore separation. The wastes from wet separation are typically sand and silt size and are called “tailings.” Milling produces large chat waste piles and flat areas with tailings deposited in impoundments. Tailings generally contain higher concentrations of heavy metals and therefore present a higher risk to human health and the environment through direct contact. Chat typically ranges in diameter from 1/4 to 5/8 inch.
 Cleanup ,,"Intermingled material such as sands measure 0.033-0.008 inches in diameter and fine tailings are less than 0.008 inches (0.20 mm) in diameter. Although poisonous, chat can be used to improve traction on snow-covered roads; as gravel; and as construction aggregate, principally for railroad ballast, highway construction, and concrete production.

 Exhibitions and studies ,,"A season of artworks and exhibits on the theme of dirt was sponsored by the Wellcome Trust in 2011. The centrepiece was an exhibition at the Wellcome Collection showing pictures and histories of notable dirt such as the great dust heaps at Euston and King's Cross in the 19th century and the Fresh Kills landfill which was once the world's largest landfill. When things are dirty, they are usually cleaned with solutions like hard surface cleaner and other chemical solutions; much domestic activity is for this purpose—washing, sweeping, and so forth.In a commercial setting, a dirty appearance gives a bad impression."
 Exhibitions and studies ,,"An example of such a place is a restaurant. The dirt in such cases may be classified as temporary, permanent, and deliberate. Temporary dirt is streaks and detritus that may be removed by ordinary daily cleaning. Permanent dirt is ingrained stains or physical damage to an object, which requires major renovation to remove. Deliberate dirt is that which results from design decisions such as decor in dirty orange or grunge styling. As cities developed, arrangements were made for the disposal of trash through the use of waste management services."
 Exhibitions and studies ,,"In the United Kingdom, the Public Health Act 1875 required households to place their refuse into a container that could be moved so that it could be carted away. This was the first legal creation of the dustbin. Modern society is now thought to be more hygienic. Lack of contact with microorganisms in dirt when growing up is hypothesised to be the cause of the epidemic of allergies such as asthma. The human immune system requires activation and exercise in order to function properly and exposure to dirt may achieve this."
 Exhibitions and studies ,,"For example, the presence of staphylococcus bacteria on the surface of the skin regulates the inflammation which results from injury.Even when no visible dirt is present, contamination by microorganisms, especially pathogens, can still cause an object or location to be considered dirty. For example, computer keyboards are especially dirty as they contain on average 70 times more microbes than a lavatory seat.People and animals may eat dirt. This is thought to be caused by mineral deficiency and so the condition is commonly seen in pregnant women."
 Exhibitions and studies ,,"People may become obsessed by dirt and engage in fantasies and compulsive behaviour about it, such as making and consuming mud pies and pastries. The source of such thinking may be genetic, as the emotion of disgust is common and the location for this activity in the brain has been proposed."

 Chemical composition and classification ,,"Fly ash material solidifies while suspended in the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while suspended in the exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and range in size from 0.5 µm to 300 µm. The major consequence of the rapid cooling is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some refractory phases in the pulverized coal do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a heterogeneous material."
 Chemical composition and classification ,,"SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a glass phase, together with quartz, mullite and the iron oxides hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite. Other phases often identified are cristobalite, anhydrite, free lime, periclase, calcite, sylvite, halite, portlandite, rutile and anatase. The Ca-bearing minerals anorthite, gehlenite, akermanite and various calcium silicates and calcium aluminates identical to those found in Portland cement can be identified in Ca-rich fly ashes."
 Chemical composition and classification ,,"The mercury content can reach 1 ppm, but is generally included in the range 0.01–1 ppm for bituminous coal. The concentrations of other trace elements vary as well according to the kind of coal combusted to form it."
 Chemical composition and classification , Classification ,"Two classes of fly ash are defined by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) C618: Class F fly ash and Class C fly ash. The chief difference between these classes is the amount of calcium, silica, alumina, and iron content in the ash. The chemical properties of the fly ash are largely influenced by the chemical content of the coal burned (i.e., anthracite, bituminous, and lignite).Not all fly ashes meet ASTM C618 requirements, although depending on the application, this may not be necessary."
 Chemical composition and classification , Classification ,"Fly ash used as a cement replacement must meet strict construction standards, but no standard environmental regulations have been established in the United States. Seventy-five percent of the fly ash must have a fineness of 45 µm or less, and have a carbon content, measured by the loss on ignition (LOI), of less than 4%. In the US, LOI must be under 6%. The particle size distribution of raw fly ash tends to fluctuate constantly, due to changing performance of the coal mills and the boiler performance."
 Chemical composition and classification , Classification ,"This makes it necessary that, if fly ash is used in an optimal way to replace cement in concrete production, it must be processed using beneficiation methods like mechanical air classification. But if fly ash is used as a filler to replace sand in concrete production, unbeneficiated fly ash with higher LOI can be also used. Especially important is the ongoing quality verification. This is mainly expressed by quality control seals like the Bureau of Indian Standards mark or the DCL mark of the Dubai Municipality."
 Chemical composition and classification ," Class ""F"" ","The burning of harder, older anthracite and bituminous coal typically produces Class F fly ash. This fly ash is pozzolanic in nature, and contains less than 7% lime (CaO). Possessing pozzolanic properties, the glassy silica and alumina of Class F fly ash requires a cementing agent, such as Portland cement, quicklime, or hydrated lime—mixed with water to react and produce cementitious compounds. Alternatively, adding a chemical activator such as sodium silicate (water glass) to a Class F ash can form a geopolymer."
 Chemical composition and classification ," Class ""C"" ","Fly ash produced from the burning of younger lignite or sub-bituminous coal, in addition to having pozzolanic properties, also has some self-cementing properties. In the presence of water, Class C fly ash hardens and gets stronger over time. Class C fly ash generally contains more than 20% lime (CaO). Unlike Class F, self-cementing Class C fly ash does not require an activator. Alkali and sulfate (SO4) contents are generally higher in Class C fly ashes. At least one US manufacturer has announced a fly ash brick containing up to 50% Class C fly ash."
 Chemical composition and classification ," Class ""C"" ","Testing shows bricks meet or exceed the performance standards listed in ASTM C 216 for conventional clay brick. It is also within the allowable shrinkage limits for concrete brick in ASTM C 55, Standard Specification for Concrete Building Brick. It is estimated that the production method used in fly ash bricks will reduce the embodied energy of masonry construction by up to 90%. Bricks and pavers were expected to be available in commercial quantities before the end of 2009. In the past, fly ash produced from coal combustion was simply entrained in flue gases and dispersed into the atmosphere."
 Chemical composition and classification ," Class ""C"" ","This created environmental and health concerns that prompted laws in heavily industrialized countries that have reduced fly ash emissions to less than 1% of ash produced. Worldwide, more than 65% of fly ash produced from coal power stations is disposed of in landfills and ash ponds. Ash that is stored or deposited outdoors can eventually leach toxic compounds into underground water aquifers. For this reason, much of the current debate around fly ash disposal revolves around creating specially lined landfills that prevent the chemical compounds from being leached into the ground water and local ecosystems."
 Chemical composition and classification ," Class ""C"" ","Since coal was the dominant energy source in the United States for many decades, power companies often located their coal plants near metropolitan areas. Compounding the environmental issues, the coal plants need significant amounts of water to operate their boilers, leading coal plants (and later their fly ash storage basins) to be located near metropolitan areas and near rivers and lakes which are often used as drinking supplies by nearby cities. Many of those fly ash basins were unlined and also at great risk of spilling and flooding from nearby rivers and lakes."
 Chemical composition and classification ," Class ""C"" ","For example, Duke Energy in North Carolina has been involved in several major lawsuits related to its coal ash storage and spills into the leakage of ash into the water basin.The recycling of fly ash has become an increasing concern in recent years due to increasing landfill costs and current interest in sustainable development. As of 2017, coal-fired power plants in the US reported producing 38.2 million short tons (34.7×10^6 t) of fly ash, of which 24.1 million short tons (21.9×10^6 t) were reused in various applications."
 Chemical composition and classification ," Class ""C"" ","Environmental benefits to recycling fly ash includes reducing the demand for virgin materials that would need quarrying and cheap substitution for materials such as Portland cement. There is no US governmental registration or labelling of fly ash utilization in the different sectors of the economy – industry, infrastructures and agriculture. Fly ash utilization survey data, acknowledged as incomplete, are published annually by the American Coal Ash Association.Coal ash uses include (approximately in order of decreasing importance): Concrete production, as a substitute material for Portland cement, sand. Corrosion control in RC structures Fly-ash pellets which can replace normal aggregate in concrete mixture."

 Reuse , Portland cement ,"Owing to its pozzolanic properties, fly ash is used as a replacement for Portland cement in concrete. The use of fly ash as a pozzolanic ingredient was recognized as early as 1914, although the earliest noteworthy study of its use was in 1937. Roman structures such as aqueducts or the Pantheon in Rome used volcanic ash or pozzolana (which possesses similar properties to fly ash) as pozzolan in their concrete. As pozzolan greatly improves the strength and durability of concrete, the use of ash is a key factor in their preservation."
 Reuse , Portland cement ,"Use of fly ash as a partial replacement for Portland cement is particularly suitable but not limited to Class C fly ashes. Class ""F"" fly ashes can have volatile effects on the entrained air content of concrete, causing reduced resistance to freeze/thaw damage. Fly ash often replaces up to 30% by mass of Portland cement, but can be used in higher dosages in certain applications. In some cases, fly ash can add to the concrete's final strength and increase its chemical resistance and durability. Fly ash can significantly improve the workability of concrete."
 Reuse , Portland cement ,"Recently, techniques have been developed to replace partial cement with high-volume fly ash (50% cement replacement). For roller-compacted concrete (RCC)[used in dam construction], replacement values of 70% have been achieved with processed fly ash at the Ghatghar dam project in Maharashtra, India. Due to the spherical shape of fly ash particles, it can increase workability of cement while reducing water demand."
 Reuse , Portland cement ,"Proponents of fly ash claim that replacing Portland cement with fly ash reduces the greenhouse gas ""footprint"" of concrete, as the production of one ton of Portland cement generates approximately one ton of CO2, compared to no CO2 generated with fly ash. New fly ash production, i.e., the burning of coal, produces approximately 20 to 30 tons of CO2 per ton of fly ash."
 Reuse , Portland cement ,"Since the worldwide production of Portland cement is expected to reach nearly 2 billion tons by 2010, replacement of any large portion of this cement by fly ash could significantly reduce carbon emissions associated with construction, as long as the comparison takes the production of fly ash as a given."
 Reuse , Embankment ,"Fly ash properties are unusual among engineering materials. Unlike soils typically used for embankment construction, fly ash has a large uniformity coefficient and it consists of clay-sized particles. Engineering properties that affect the use of fly ash in embankments include grain size distribution, compaction characteristics, shear strength, compressibility, permeability, and frost susceptibility. Nearly all the types of fly ash used in embankments are Class F."
 Reuse , Soil stabilization ,"Soil stabilization is the permanent physical and chemical alteration of soils to enhance their physical properties. Stabilization can increase the shear strength of a soil and/or control the shrink-swell properties of a soil, thus improving the load-bearing capacity of a sub-grade to support pavements and foundations. Stabilization can be used to treat a wide range of sub-grade materials from expansive clays to granular materials. Stabilization can be achieved with a variety of chemical additives including lime, fly ash, and Portland cement. Proper design and testing is an important component of any stabilization project."
 Reuse , Soil stabilization ,"This allows for the establishment of design criteria, and determination of the proper chemical additive and admixture rate that achieves the desired engineering properties. Stabilization process benefits can include: Higher resistance (R) values, Reduction in plasticity, Lower permeability, Reduction of pavement thickness, Elimination of excavation – material hauling/handling – and base importation, Aids compaction, Provides ""all-weather"" access onto and within projects sites. Another form of soil treatment closely related to soil stabilization is soil modification, sometimes referred to as ""mud drying"" or soil conditioning."
 Reuse , Soil stabilization ,"Although some stabilization inherently occurs in soil modification, the distinction is that soil modification is merely a means to reduce the moisture content of a soil to expedite construction, whereas stabilization can substantially increase the shear strength of a material such that it can be incorporated into the project's structural design. The determining factors associated with soil modification vs soil stabilization may be the existing moisture content, the end use of the soil structure and ultimately the cost benefit provided."
 Reuse , Soil stabilization ,"Equipment for the stabilization and modification processes include: chemical additive spreaders, soil mixers (reclaimers), portable pneumatic storage containers, water trucks, deep lift compactors, motor graders."
 Reuse , Flowable fill ,"Fly ash is also used as a component in the production of flowable fill (also called controlled low strength material, or CLSM), which is used as self-leveling, self-compact backfill material in lieu of compacted earth or granular fill. The strength of flowable fill mixes can range from 50 to 1,200 lbf/in2 (0.3 to 8.3 MPa), depending on the design requirements of the project in question. Flowable fill includes mixtures of Portland cement and filler material, and can contain mineral admixtures. Fly ash can replace either the Portland cement or fine aggregate (in most cases, river sand) as a filler material."
 Reuse , Flowable fill ,"High fly ash content mixes contain nearly all fly ash, with a small percentage of Portland cement and enough water to make the mix flowable. Low fly ash content mixes contain a high percentage of filler material, and a low percentage of fly ash, Portland cement, and water. Class F fly ash is best suited for high fly ash content mixes, whereas Class C fly ash is almost always used in low fly ash content mixes."
 Reuse , Asphalt concrete ,"Asphalt concrete is a composite material consisting of an asphalt binder and mineral aggregate commonly used to surface roads. Both Class F and Class C fly ash can typically be used as a mineral filler to fill the voids and provide contact points between larger aggregate particles in asphalt concrete mixes. This application is used in conjunction, or as a replacement for, other binders (such as Portland cement or hydrated lime). For use in asphalt pavement, the fly ash must meet mineral filler specifications outlined in ASTM D242. The hydrophobic nature of fly ash gives pavements better resistance to stripping."
 Reuse , Asphalt concrete ,"Fly ash has also been shown to increase the stiffness of the asphalt matrix, improving rutting resistance and increasing mix durability."
 Reuse , Filler for thermoplastics ,Coal and shale oil fly ashes have been used as a filler for thermoplastics that could be used for injection molding applications.
 Reuse , Geopolymers ,"More recently, fly ash has been used as a component in geopolymers, where the reactivity of the fly ash glasses can be used to create a binder similar to a hydrated Portland cement in appearance, but with potentially superior properties, including reduced CO2 emissions, depending on the formulation."
 Reuse , Roller compacted concrete ,Another application of using fly ash is in roller compacted concrete dams. Many dams in the US have been constructed with high fly ash contents. Fly ash lowers the heat of hydration allowing thicker placements to occur. Data for these can be found at the US Bureau of Reclamation. This has also been demonstrated in the Ghatghar Dam Project in India.
 Reuse , Bricks ,"There are several techniques for manufacturing construction bricks from fly ash, producing a wide variety of products. One type of fly ash brick is manufactured by mixing fly ash with an equal amount of clay, then firing in a kiln at about 1000 °C. This approach has the principal benefit of reducing the amount of clay required. Another type of fly ash brick is made by mixing soil, plaster of Paris, fly ash and water, and allowing the mixture to dry. Because no heat is required, this technique reduces air pollution."
 Reuse , Bricks ,"More modern manufacturing processes use a greater proportion of fly ash, and a high pressure manufacturing technique, which produces high strength bricks with environmental benefits. In the United Kingdom, fly ash has been used for over fifty years to make concrete building blocks. They are widely used for the inner skin of cavity walls. They are naturally more thermally insulating than blocks made with other aggregates. Ash bricks have been used in house construction in Windhoek, Namibia, since the 1970s. There is, however, a problem with the bricks in that they tend to fail or produce unsightly pop-outs."
 Reuse , Bricks ,"This happens when the bricks come into contact with moisture and a chemical reaction occurs causing the bricks to expand.In India, fly ash bricks are used for construction. Leading manufacturers use an industrial standard known as ""Pulverized fuel ash for lime-Pozzolana mixture"" using over 75% post-industrial recycled waste, and a compression process. This produces a strong product with good insulation properties and environmental benefits."
 Reuse , Metal matrix composites ,"Fly ash particles have proved their potential as good reinforcement with aluminum alloys and show the improvement of physical and mechanical properties. In particular, the compression strength, tensile strength, and hardness increase when the percentage of fly ash content is increased, whereas the density decreases. The presence of fly ash cenospheres in a pure Al matrix decreases its coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)."
 Reuse , Mineral extraction ,It may be possible to use vacuum distillation in order to extract germanium and tungsten from fly ash and recycle them.
 Reuse , Waste treatment and stabilization ,"Fly ash, in view of its alkalinity and water absorption capacity, may be used in combination with other alkaline materials to transform sewage sludge into organic fertilizer or biofuel."
 Reuse , Catalyst ,"Fly ash, when treated with sodium hydroxide, appears to function well as a catalyst for converting polyethylene into substance similar to crude oil in a high-temperature process called pyrolysis and utilized in waste water treatment.In addition, fly ash, mainly class C, may be used in the stabilization/solidification process of hazardous wastes and contaminated soils. For example, the Rhenipal process uses fly ash as an admixture to stabilize sewage sludge and other toxic sludges. This process has been used since 1996 to stabilize large amounts of chromium(VI) contaminated leather sludges in Alcanena, Portugal."
 Environmental problems , Groundwater contamination ,"Coal contains trace levels of trace elements (such as arsenic, barium, beryllium, boron, cadmium, chromium, thallium, selenium, molybdenum and mercury), many of which are highly toxic to humans and other life. Therefore, fly ash obtained after combustion of this coal contains enhanced concentrations of these elements and the potential of the ash to cause groundwater pollution is significant. In the USA there are documented cases of groundwater pollution that followed ash disposal or utilization without the necessary protection having been put in place."
 Environmental problems , Maryland ,"Constellation Energy disposed fly ash generated by its Brandon Shores Generating Station at a former sand and gravel mine in Gambrills, Maryland, during 1996 to 2007. The ash contaminated groundwater with heavy metals. The Maryland Department of the Environment issued a fine of $1 million to Constellation. Nearby residents filed a lawsuit against Constellation and in 2008 the company settled the case for $54 million."
 Environmental problems , North Carolina ,"In 2014, residents living near the Buck Steam Station in Dukeville, North Carolina, were told that ""coal ash pits near their homes could be leaching dangerous materials into groundwater."""
 Environmental problems , Illinois ,"Illinois has many coal ash dumpsites with coal ash generated by coal-burning electric power plants. Of the state's 24 coal ash dumpsites with available data, 22 have released toxic pollutants including arsenic, cobalt, and lithium, into groundwater, rivers and lakes."

 Environmental problems , Illinois ,"toxic chemicals dumped into the water in Illinois by these coal ash dumpsites include more than 300,000 pounds of aluminum, 600 pounds of arsenic, nearly 300,000 pounds of boron, over 200 pounds of cadmium, over 15,000 pounds of manganese, roughly 1,500 pounds of selenium, roughly 500,000 pounds of nitrogen, and nearly 40 million pounds of sulfate, according to a report by the Environmental Integrity Project, Earthjustice, the Prairie Rivers Network, and the Sierra Club.Tennessee In 2008, the Kingston Fossil Plant in Roane County spilled 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash into the Emory and Clinch Rivers and damaged nearby residential areas."
 Environmental problems , Illinois ,It is the largest industrial spill in the U.S.
 Environmental problems , Texas ,"Groundwater surrounding every single one of the 16 coal-burning power plants in Texas has been polluted by coal ash, according to a study by the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP). Unsafe levels of arsenic, cobalt, lithium, and other contaminants were found in the groundwater near all the ash dump sites. At 12 of the 16 sites, the EIP analysis found levels of arsenic in the groundwater 10 times higher than the EPA Maximum Contaminant Level; arsenic has been found to cause several types of cancer."
 Environmental problems , Texas ,"At 10 of the sites, lithium, which causes neurological disease, was found in the groundwater at concentrations more than 1,000 micrograms per liter, which is 25 times the maximum acceptable level. The report concludes that the fossil fuel industry in Texas has failed to comply with federal regulations on coal ash processing, and state regulators have failed to protect the groundwater."
 Environmental problems , Ecology ,"The effect of fly ash on the environment can vary based on the thermal power plant where it is produced, as well as the proportion of fly ash to bottom ash in the waste product. This is due to the different chemical make-up of the coal based on the geology of the area the coal is found and the burning process of the coal in the power plant. When the coal is combusted, it creates an alkaline dust. This alkaline dust can have a pH ranging from 8 to as high as 12."
 Environmental problems , Ecology ,"Fly ash dust can be deposited on topsoil increasing the pH and affecting the plants and animals in the surrounding ecosystem. Trace elements, such as, iron, manganese, zinc, copper, lead, nickel, chromium, cobalt, arsenic, cadmium, and mercury, can be found at higher concentrations compared to bottom ash and the parent coal.Fly ash can leach toxic constituents that can be anywhere from one hundred to one thousand times greater than the federal standard for drinking water."
 Environmental problems , Ecology ,"Fly ash can contaminate surface water through erosion, surface runoff, airborne particles landing on the water surface, contaminated ground water moving into surface waters, flooding drainage, or discharge from a coal ash pond. Fish can be contaminated a couple of different ways. When the water is contaminated by fly ash, the fish can absorb the toxins through their gills. The sediment in the water can also become contaminated. The contaminated sediment can contaminate the food sources for the fish, the fish can then become contaminated from consuming those food sources."
 Environmental problems , Ecology ,"This can then lead to contamination of organisms that consume these fish, such as, birds, bear, and even humans. Once exposed to fly ash contaminating the water, aquatic organisms have had increased levels of calcium, zinc, bromine, gold, cerium, chromium, selenium, cadmium, and mercury.Soils contaminated by fly ash showed an increase in bulk density and water capacity, but a decrease in hydraulic conductivity and cohesiveness. The effect of fly ash on soils and microorganisms in the soils are influenced by the pH of the ash and trace metal concentrations in the ash."
 Environmental problems , Ecology ,"Microbial communities in contaminated soil have shown reductions in respiration and nitrification. These contaminated soils can be detrimental or beneficial to plant development. Fly ash typically has beneficial outcomes when it corrects nutrient deficiencies in the soil. Most detrimental effects were observed when boron phytotoxicity was observed. Plants absorb elements elevated by the fly ash from the soil. Arsenic, molybdenum, and selenium were the only elements found at potentially toxic levels for grazing animals."
 Environmental problems , Ecology ,"Terrestrial organisms exposed to fly ash only showed increased levels of selenium.In the UK, fly ash lagoons from old coal-fired power stations have been made into nature reserves such as Newport Wetlands, providing habitat for rare birds and other wildlife."
 Environmental problems , Spills of bulk storage ,"Where fly ash is stored in bulk, it is usually stored wet rather than dry to minimize fugitive dust. The resulting impoundments (ash ponds) are typically large and stable for long periods, but any breach of their dams or bunding is rapid and on a massive scale. In December 2008, the collapse of an embankment at an impoundment for wet storage of fly ash at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston Fossil Plant caused a major release of 5.4 million cubic yards of coal fly ash, damaging three homes and flowing into the Emory River. Cleanup costs may exceed $1.2 billion."
 Environmental problems , Spills of bulk storage ,"This spill was followed a few weeks later by a smaller TVA-plant spill in Alabama, which contaminated Widows Creek and the Tennessee River.In 2014, 39,000 tons of ash and 27 million gallons (100,000 cubic meters) of contaminated water spilled into the Dan River near Eden, NC from a closed North Carolina coal-fired power plant that is owned by Duke Energy. It is currently the third worst coal ash spill ever to happen in the United States.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) regulation in 2015."
 Environmental problems , Spills of bulk storage ,"The agency continued to classify coal ash as non-hazardous (thereby avoiding strict permitting requirements under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), but with new restrictions: Existing ash ponds that are contaminating groundwater must stop receiving CCR, and close or retrofit with a liner. Existing ash ponds and landfills must comply with structural and location restrictions, where applicable, or close. A pond no longer receiving CCR is still subject to all regulations unless it is dewatered and covered by 2018."
 Environmental problems , Spills of bulk storage ,"New ponds and landfills must include a geomembrane liner over a layer of compacted soil.The regulation was designed to prevent pond failures and protect groundwater. Enhanced inspection, record keeping and monitoring is required. Procedures for closure are also included and include capping, liners, and dewatering. The CCR regulation has since been subject to litigation."
 Environmental problems , Contaminants ,"Fly ash contains trace concentrations of heavy metals and other substances that are known to be detrimental to health in sufficient quantities. Potentially toxic trace elements in coal include arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, barium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, radium, selenium, thorium, uranium, vanadium, and zinc. Approximately 10% of the mass of coals burned in the United States consists of unburnable mineral material that becomes ash, so the concentration of most trace elements in coal ash is approximately 10 times the concentration in the original coal."
 Environmental problems , Contaminants ,"A 1997 analysis by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) found that fly ash typically contained 10 to 30 ppm of uranium, comparable to the levels found in some granitic rocks, phosphate rock, and black shale.In 1980 the U.S. Congress defined coal ash as a ""special waste"" that would not be regulated under the stringent hazardous waste permitting requirements of RCRA. In its amendments to RCRA, Congress directed EPA to study the special waste issue and make a determination as to whether stricter permit regulation was necessary."
 Environmental problems , Contaminants ,"In 2000, EPA stated that coal fly ash did not need to be regulated as a hazardous waste. As a result, most power plants were not required to install geomembranes or leachate collection systems in ash ponds.Studies by the USGS and others of radioactive elements in coal ash have concluded that fly ash compares with common soils or rocks and should not be the source of alarm. However, community and environmental organizations have documented numerous environmental contamination and damage concerns. Crystalline silica and lime along with toxic chemicals represent exposure risks to human health and the environment."
 Environmental problems , Contaminants ,"Fly ash contains crystalline silica which is known to cause lung disease, in particular silicosis, if inhaled. Crystalline silica is listed by the IARC and US National Toxicology Program as a known human carcinogen.Lime (CaO) reacts with water (H2O) to form calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2], giving fly ash a pH somewhere between 10 and 12, a medium to strong base. This can also cause lung damage if present in sufficient quantities. Material Safety Data Sheets recommend a number of safety precautions be taken when handling or working with fly ash."
 Environmental problems , Contaminants ,"These include wearing protective goggles, respirators and disposable clothing and avoiding agitating the fly ash in order to minimize the amount which becomes airborne. The National Academy of Sciences noted in 2007 that ""the presence of high contaminant levels in many CCR (coal combustion residue) leachates may create human health and ecological concerns""."
 Regulation , United States ,"Following the 2008 Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill, EPA began developing regulations that would apply to all ash ponds nationwide. EPA published the CCR rule in 2015. Some of the provisions in the 2015 CCR regulation were challenged in litigation, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded certain portions of the regulation to EPA for further rulemaking.EPA published a proposed rule on August 14, 2019, that would use location-based criteria, rather than a numerical threshold (i.e."
 Regulation , United States ,"impoundment or landfill size) that would require an operator to demonstrate minimal environmental impact so that a site could remain in operation.In response to the court remand, EPA published its ""CCR Part A"" final rule on August 28, 2020 requiring all unlined ash ponds to retrofit with liners or close by April 11, 2021. Some facilities may apply to obtain additional time—up to 2028—to find alternatives for managing ash wastes before closing their surface impoundments."
 Regulation , United States ,"EPA published its ""CCR Part B"" rule on November 12, 2020, which allows certain facilities to use an alternative liner, based on a demonstration that human health and the environment will not be affected. Further litigation on the CCR regulation is pending as of 2021.In October 2020 EPA published a final effluent guidelines rule that reverses some provisions of its 2015 regulation, which had tightened requirements on toxic metals in wastewater discharged from ash ponds and other power plant wastestreams. The 2020 rule has also been challenged in litigation."
 Regulation , United States ,In March 2023 EPA published a proposed rule that would reverse some aspects of the 2020 rule and impose more stringent wastewater limitations for some facilities.
 Regulation , India ,"The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of India first published a gazette notification in 1999 specifying use of fly ash and mandating a target date for all thermal power plants to comply by ensuring 100% utilisation. Subsequent amendments in 2003 and 2009 shifted the deadline for compliance to 2014. As reported by Central Electricity Authority, New Delhi, as of 2015, only 60% of fly ash produced was being utilised. This has resulted in the latest notification in 2015 which has set December 31, 2017, as the revised deadline to achieve 100% utilisation."
 Regulation , India ,"Out of the approximately 55.7% fly ash utilised, bulk of it (42.3%) goes into cement production whereas only about 0.74% is used as an additive in concrete (See Table 5 [29]). Researchers in India are actively addressing this challenge by working on fly ash as an admixture for concrete and activated pozzolanic cement such as geopolymer [34] to help achieve the target of 100% utilisation. The biggest scope clearly lies in the area of increasing the quantity of fly ash being incorporated in concrete. India produced 280 Million Tonnes of Cement in 2016 ."
 Regulation , India ,"With housing sector consuming 67% of the cement, there is a huge scope for incorporating fly ash in both the increasing share of PPC and low to moderate strength concrete. There is a misconception that the Indian codes IS 456:2000 for Concrete and Reinforced Concrete and IS 3812.1:2013 for Fly Ash restrict the use of Fly Ash to less than 35%. Similar misconceptions exists in countries like USA but evidence to the contrary is the use of HVFA in many large projects where design mixes have been used under strict quality control."
 Regulation , India ,"It is suggested that in order to make the most of the research results presented in the paper, Ultra High Volume Fly ash Concrete (UHVFA) concrete is urgently developed for widespread use in India using local fly ash. Urgent steps are also required to promote alkali activated pozzolan or geopolymer cement based concretes."
 Regulation , India ,"Due to the ignition of coal deposits by the Siberian Traps during the Permian–Triassic extinction event around 252 million years ago, large amounts of char very similar to modern fly ash were released into the oceans, which is preserved in the geologic record in marine deposits located in the Canadian High Arctic. It has been hypothesised that the fly ash could have resulted in toxic environmental conditions."

 Types ,,"More recent studies have found that more than half of plastic debris found on Korean shores is ocean-based.A wide variety of man-made objects can become marine debris; plastic bags, balloons, buoys, rope, medical waste, glass and plastic bottles, cigarette stubs, cigarette lighters, beverage cans, polystyrene, lost fishing line and nets, and various wastes from cruise ships and oil rigs are among the items commonly found to have washed ashore."
 Types ,,"Six pack rings, in particular, are considered emblematic of the problem.The US military used ocean dumping for unused weapons and bombs, including ordinary bombs, UXO, landmines and chemical weapons from at least 1919 until 1970. Millions of pounds of ordnance were disposed of in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of at least 16 states, from New Jersey to Hawaii (although these, of course, do not wash up onshore, and the US is not the only country who has practiced this).Eighty percent of marine debris is plastic."
 Types ,,"Plastics accumulate because they typically do not biodegrade as many other substances do. They photodegrade on exposure to sunlight, although they do so only under dry conditions, as water inhibits photolysis. In a 2014 study using computer models, scientists from the group 5 Gyres, estimated 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic weighing 269,000 tons were dispersed in oceans in similar amount in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres."
 Types , Persistent industrial marine debris ,"Some materials and activities used in industrial activities that do not readily degrade, that persist in the environment, and tend to accumulate over time. The activities can include fishing, boating, and aquaculture industries that harvest or use resources in the marine environment and may lose or discard gear, materials, machinery or solid wastes from industrial processes into the water or onto shorelines. This can include anything as large as a fishing boat or as small as particle from a Styrofoam lobster float."
 Types , Persistent industrial marine debris ,"In 2003, a study was conducted to identify types, amounts, sources, and effects of persistent industrial marine debris in the coastal waters and along the shores of Charlotte County, New Brunswick, and examine any relationship between the amount and types of persistent industrial marine debris, and the types and numbers of industrial operations nearby. Materials like plastic or foam can break down into smaller particles and may look like small sea creatures to wildlife such as birds, cetaceans, and fish, and they may eat these particles."
 Types , Persistent industrial marine debris ,Indigestible material may accumulate in the gut creating blockages or a false sense of fullness and eventually death from lack of appropriate nutrient intake.
 Types , Deep-sea debris ,"Marine debris is even found on the floor of the Arctic ocean. Although an increasing number of studies have been focused on plastic debris accumulation on the coasts, in off-shore surface waters, and that ingested by marine organisms that live in the upper levels of the water column, there is limited information on debris in the mesopelagic and deeper layers. Studies that have been done have conducted research through bottom sampling, video observation via remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and submersibles."

 Types , Deep-sea debris ,"Plastics that are usually negatively buoyant can sink with the adherence of phytoplankton and the aggregation of other organic particles. Other oceanic processes that affect circulation, such as coastal storms and offshore convection, play a part in transferring large volumes of particles and debris. Submarine topographic features can also augment downwelling currents, leading to the retention of microplastics at certain locations.A Deep-sea Debris database by the Global Oceanographic Data Center of the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), showing thirty years of photos and samples of marine debris since 1983, was made public in 2017."

The two most significant types of debris were macro-plastic, making up 33% of the debris found – 89% of which was single-use – and metal, making up 26%. Plastic debris was even found at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, at a depth of 10,898m, and plastic bags were found entangled in hydrothermal vent and cold seep communities."

 Types , Garbage patches (gyres) ,"Around four-fifths of oceanic debris is from rubbish blown onto the water from landfills, and urban runoff.Some studies show that marine debris may be dominant in particular locations. For example, a 2016 study of Aruba found that debris found the windward side of the island was predominantly marine debris from distant sources. In 2013, debris from six beaches in Korea was collected and analyzed: 56% was found to be ""ocean-based"" and 44% ""land-based"".In the 1987 Syringe Tide, medical waste washed ashore in New Jersey after having been blown from Fresh Kills Landfill."

Not all anthropogenic artifacts placed in the oceans are harmful. Iron and concrete structures typically do little damage to the environment because they generally sink to the bottom and become immobile, and at shallow depths they can even provide scaffolding for artificial reefs."

 Environmental impacts , Impacts from plastic pollution ,"Many animals that live on or in the sea consume flotsam by mistake, as it often looks similar to their natural prey. Overall, 1288 marine species are known to ingest plastic debris, with fish making up the largest fraction. Bulky plastic debris may become permanently lodged in the digestive tracts of these animals, blocking the passage of food and causing death through starvation or infection. Tiny floating plastic particles also resemble zooplankton, which can lead filter feeders to consume them and cause them to enter the ocean food chain."
 Environmental impacts , Impacts from plastic pollution ,"In addition, plastic in the marine environment that contaminates the food chain can have repercussions on the viability of fish and shellfish species."
 Environmental impacts , COVID-19 pandemic impacts ,"In Kenya, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the amount of marine debris found on beaches with around 55% being a pandemic-related trash items. Although the pandemic-related trash has shown up along the beaches of Kenya, it has not made its way into the water. The reduction of litter in the ocean could be a result of the closing of beaches and lack of movement during the pandemic, so less trash was likely to end up in the ocean."
 Environmental impacts , COVID-19 pandemic impacts ,"Additional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been seen in Hong Kong, where disposable masks have ended up along the beaches of Soko’s islands. This may be attributed to the increased production of medical products (masks and gloves) during the pandemic, leading to a rise in unconventional disposal of these products."
 Removal , Coastal and river clean ups ,"Techniques for collecting and removing marine (or riverine) debris include the use of debris skimmer boats (pictured). Devices such as these can be used where floating debris presents a danger to navigation. For example, the US Army Corps of Engineers removes 90 tons of ""drifting material"" from San Francisco Bay every month. The Corps has been doing this work since 1942, when a seaplane carrying Admiral Chester W. Nimitz collided with a piece of floating debris and sank, costing the life of its pilot. The Ocean cleanup has also created a vessel for cleaning up riverine debris, called Interceptor."
 Removal , Coastal and river clean ups ,"Once debris becomes ""beach litter"", collection by hand and specialized beach-cleaning machines are used to gather the debris. There are also projects that stimulate fishing boats to remove any litter they accidentally fish up while fishing for fish.Elsewhere, ""trash traps"" are installed on small rivers to capture waterborne debris before it reaches the sea. For example, South Australia's Adelaide operates a number of such traps, known as ""trash racks"" or ""gross pollutant traps"" on the Torrens River, which flows (during the wet season) into Gulf St Vincent.In lakes or near the coast, manual removal can also be used."
 Removal , Coastal and river clean ups ,"Project AWARE for example promotes the idea of letting dive clubs clean up litter, for example as a diving exercise.Once a year there is a diving marine debris removal operation in Scapa Flow in the Orkneys, run by Ghost Fishing UK, funded by World Animal Protection and Fat Face Foundation.Cleanup of marine debris can be stymied by inadequate collaboration across levels of government, and a patchwork of regulatory authorities (responsibility often differs for the ocean surface, the seabed, and the shore). For example, there are an estimated 1600 abandoned and derelict boats in the waters of British Columbia."
 Removal , Coastal and river clean ups ,"In 2019 Canada's federal government passed legislation to make it illegal to abandon a vessel but enforcement is hampered because it is often difficult to determine who owns an abandoned boat since owners are not required to have a license – licensing is a provincial government responsibility. The Victoria-based non-profit Dead Boats Disposal Society notes that lack of enforcement means abandoned boats are often left to sink, which increases the cleanup cost and compounds the environmental hazard (due to seepage of fuel, oil, plastics, and other pollutants)."
 Removal , Mid-ocean clean ups ,"On the sea, the removal of artificial debris (i.e. plastics) is still in its infancy. However, some projects have been started which used ships with nets (Ocean Voyages Institute/Kaisei 2009 & 2010 and New Horizon 2009) to catch some plastics, primarily for research purposes. There is also Bluebird Marine System's SeaVax which was solar- and wind-powered and had an onboard shredder and cargo hold. The Sea Cleaners' Manta ship is similar in concept.Another method to gather artificial litter has been proposed by The Ocean Cleanup's Boyan Slat."

 Removal , Mid-ocean clean ups ,"Utilizing custom designed GPS satellite trackers which are deployed by vessels of opportunity, Ocean Voyages Institute is able to accurately track and send cleanup vessels to remove ghostnets. The GPS Tracker technology is being combined with satellite imagery increasing the ability to locate plastic trash and ghostnets in real time via satellite imagery which will greatly increase cleanup capacity and efficiency.Another issue is that removing marine debris from the ocean can potentially cause more harm than good."
 Removal , Mid-ocean clean ups ,"Cleaning up microplastics could also accidentally take out plankton, which are the main lower level food group for the marine food chain and over half of the photosynthesis on earth. One of the most efficient and cost effective ways to help reduce the amount of plastic entering our oceans is to not participate in using single-use plastics, avoid plastic bottled drinks such as water bottles, use reusable shopping bags, and to buy products with reusable packaging. The ocean is a global common, so negative externalities of marine debris are not usually experienced by the producer."
 Removal , Mid-ocean clean ups ,"In the 1950s, the importance of government intervention with marine pollution protocol was recognized at the First Conference on the Law of the Sea.Ocean dumping is controlled by international law, including: The London Convention (1972) – a United Nations agreement to control ocean dumping This Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter consisted of twenty two articles addressing expectations of contracting parties. The three annexes defined many compounds, substances, and materials that are unacceptable to deposit into the ocean. Examples of such matter include: mercury compounds, lead, cyanides, and radioactive wastes."
 Removal , Mid-ocean clean ups ,"MARPOL 73/78 – a convention designed to minimize pollution of the seas, including dumping, oil and exhaust pollution The original MARPOL convention did not consider dumping from ships, but was revised in 1978 to include restrictions on marine vessels. UNCLOS – signed in 1982, but effective in 1994, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea emphasized the importance of protecting the entire ocean and not only specified coastal regions. UNCLOS enforced restrictions on pollution, including a stress on land-based sources."
 Laws and treaties , Australian law ,"One of the earliest anti-dumping laws was Australia's Beaches, Fishing Grounds and Sea Routes Protection Act 1932, which prohibited the discharge of ""garbage, rubbish, ashes or organic refuse"" from ""any vessel in Australian waters"" without prior written permission from the federal government. It also required permission for scuttling. The act was passed in response to large amounts of garbage washing up on the beaches of Sydney and Newcastle from vessels outside the reach of local governments and the New South Wales government."

The law will take effect in 2021."
 Laws and treaties , United States law ,"In the waters of the United States, there have been many observed consequences of pollution including: hypoxic zones, harmful agal blooms, and threatened species. In 1972, the United States Congress passed the Ocean Dumping Act, giving the Environmental Protection Agency power to monitor and regulate the dumping of sewage sludge, industrial waste, radioactive waste and biohazardous materials into the nation's territorial waters. The Act was amended sixteen years later to include medical wastes. It is illegal to dispose of any plastic in US waters."

Salvage law rewards salvors for risking life and property to rescue the property of another from peril. On land the distinction between deliberate and accidental loss led to the concept of a ""treasure trove"". In the United Kingdom, shipwrecked goods should be reported to a Receiver of Wreck, and if identifiable, they should be returned to their rightful owner.

 Activism , Mitigation ,"Marine debris is a widespread problem, not only the result of activities in coastal regions.Plastic debris from inland states come from two main sources: ordinary litter and materials from open dumps and landfills that blow or wash away to inland waterways and wastewater outflows. The refuse finds its way from inland waterways, rivers, streams and lakes to the ocean."
 Activism , Mitigation ,"Though ocean and coastal area cleanups are important, it is crucial to address plastic waste that originates from inland and landlocked states.At the systems level, there are various ways to reduce the amount of debris entering our waterways: Improve waste transportation to and from sites by utilizing closed container storage and shipping Restrict open waste facilities near waterways Promote the use of fefuse-derived fuels. Used plastic with low residual value often do not get recycled and are more likely to leak into the ocean."
 Activism , Mitigation ,"However, turning these unwanted plastics that would otherwise stay in landfills into refuse-derived fuels allows for further use; they can be used as supplement fuels at power plants Improve recovery rates for plastic (in 2012, the United States generated 11.46 million tons of plastic waste, of which only 6.7% was recovered Adapt Extended Producer Responsibility strategies to make producers responsible for product management when products and their packaging become waste; encourage reusable product design to minimize negative impacts on the environment."

 Collection of green waste ,,"Green waste can be collected via municipal curbside collection schemes or through private waste management businesses. Many communities, especially in the United Kingdom, have initiated green waste recycling and collection programs in order to decrease the amount of biodegradable materials in landfills. Communities are provided with, or can provide their own, compost receptacles that they fill with plant and food remains, which are then emptied on a regular basis."
 Collection of green waste ,,Programs such as this allow communities to be an active part of composting their green waste which allows them to play an active role in decreasing the amount of food being dumped into local and regional landfills. Green waste can be used to improve the quality and sustainability of industrially manufactured topsoils and the sanitariness and efficiency of sewage disposal.
 Uses , Manufactured topsoils ,"Green waste is an integral part of many manufactured topsoils, as it provides both nutrients for growing plants and increases the volume of manufactured topsoils. Its woody components do not decompose quickly, so they provide the bulk that is necessary for supplementary topsoils. Mixing industrial wastes such as fly ash or coal dust with green waste to create artificial topsoil not only facilitates the repurposing of industrial debris and keeps it out of landfills, but it also allows the nutrients in green waste materials to be cycled back into the environment."
 Uses , Manufactured topsoils ,"By utilizing fly ash in conjunction with green waste, manufactured soils are able to increase their water holding capacity while simultaneously recycling refuse materials that might otherwise take up space in a landfill. This allows fly ash and green waste to increase local soil nutrient levels and promotes natural nutrient cycling processes."
 Uses , Sewage disposal ,"Green waste can also be mixed with sewage wastes and composted, providing a safe, environmentally sustainable option for sewage disposal. Co-composting green and sewage wastes eliminates the risk that pathogens and pollutants contained in sewage wastes might pose to the environment. Utilization of green waste to dispose of sewage wastes not only decreases the amount of sewage incinerated and dumped each year, it also facilitates the cycling of organic wastes back into the environment. The co-composted remains of these organic wastes can be safely employed for use in agriculture."
 Uses , Sewage disposal ,This process decreases the amount of trash being dumped into landfills and other trash repositories and allows for the complete cycling of organic nutrients through the environment.
 Uses , Renewable energy ,"Biogas captured from biodegradable green waste can be used as biofuel. Green waste can be composed of non-food crops, which decompose to produce cellulosic ethanol. It can also help reduce the necessity of petroleum gases, which produce large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, when burned."
 Uses , Soil health ,Green waste composting has also been linked to suppression of soil borne diseases such as damping off and root rots that affect large agricultural and horticultural ventures like greenhouses and large-scale farms. This disease suppressive quality has positive implications for lesser-developed nations that do not have the technology or resources to purchase expensive fertilizers. Addition of composts that contain residues and particles of heavy metals to soil can raise the soil's heavy metal content and increase the probability of these metals to transfer into crop plants.
 Uses , Soil health ,"When biological, or green waste is added to these soil samples, plant uptake of heavy metal has been shown to decrease crop uptake of metals compared to other types of compost composed of things such as sewage sludge. This can protect consumers and the environment from biomagnification caused by long-term accumulation of heavy metal particles within the soil and plant life of an area.

 Artistic use ,,"Abandoned footwear is a feature in a number of artistic works, including: Some artists derive insight and inspiration from abandoned footwear - a form of art known as objet trouvé.The lost slipper in the Cinderella folktale is a classic example of the literary device of the ""lost object"".A fisherman hauling up an old boot, rather than a fish, is a comic-strip cliché.The theme of abandoned footwear and their untold story is explored in detail in Julie Ann Shapiro's novel, Jen-Zen and the One Shoe Diaries."
 Artistic use ,,"The titular character describes the phenomenon, “The forgotten shoes are everywhere: littering the side of the highway, floating in the tide, going upstream with the salmon, or occupying a field like a dead body, discarded and left to rot.” Leaving behind shoes can be a symbol of retirement in sport. For example, as ESPN's Sherry Skalko describes about Rulon Gardner's last wrestling bout in Athens, Greece: An emotional Rulon Gardner prepares to leave his shoes on the mat -- a symbol of retirement."
 Artistic use ,,"After the referee raised Gardner's hand in victory -- first to one side of the arena, then to the other -- Gardner grabbed an American flag, wiped away tears and parked himself in the middle of Mat B like ""a 33-year-old kid"" and took off his size 13 shoes.

 Sources ,,"Biodegradable waste can be found in municipal solid waste (sometimes called biodegradable municipal waste, or as green waste, food waste, paper waste and biodegradable plastics). Other biodegradable wastes include human waste, manure, sewage, sewage sludge and slaughterhouse waste. In the absence of oxygen, much of this waste will decay to methane by anaerobic digestion.In the UK, 7.4 million tonnes of biodegradable waste was sent to landfill in 2018 having reduced from 7.8 million tonnes in 2017."
 Sources ,,"In many parts of the developed world, biodegradable waste is separated from the rest of the waste stream, either by separate curb-side collection or by waste sorting after collection. At the point of collection such waste is often referred to as green waste. Removing such waste from the rest of the waste stream substantially reduces waste volumes for disposal and also allows biodegradable waste to be composted. Biodegradable waste can be used for composting or a resource for heat, electricity and fuel by means of incineration or anaerobic digestion."
 Sources ,,"Swiss Kompogas and the Danish AIKAN process are examples of anaerobic digestion of biodegradable waste. While incineration can recover the most energy, anaerobic digestion plants retain nutrients and make compost for soil amendment and still recover some of the contained energy in the form of biogas. Kompogas produced 27 million Kwh of electricity and biogas in 2009. The oldest of the company's lorries has achieved 1,000,000 kilometers driven with biogas from household waste in the last 15 years."
 Environmental impacts ,,"The majority of CCPs are landfilled, placed in mine shafts or stored in ash ponds at coal-fired power plants. Groundwater pollution from unlined ash ponds has been a continuing environmental problem in the United States. Additionally some of these ponds have had structural failures, causing massive ash spills into rivers, such as the 2014 Dan River coal ash spill. Federal design standards for ash ponds were strengthened in 2015. Following litigation challenges to various provisions of the 2015 regulations, EPA issued two final rules in 2020, labeled as the ""CCR Part A"" and """"CCR Part B"" rules."
 Environmental impacts ,,"The rules require some facilities to retrofit their impoundments with liners, while other facilities may propose alternative designs and request additional time to achieve compliance. In August 2021 EPA announced that it plans to publish a proposed rule in fall 2022 that would strengthen wastewater limits for discharges to surface waters. About 52 percent of CCPs in the U.S. were recycled for ""beneficial uses"" in 2019, according to the American Coal Ash Association. In Australia about 47% of coal ash was recycled in 2020."
 Environmental impacts ,,"The chief benefit of recycling is to stabilize the environmental harmful components of the CCPs such as arsenic, beryllium, boron, cadmium, chromium, chromium VI, cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, selenium, strontium, thallium, and vanadium, along with dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons."
 Preparation ,,"To transform the coal ash into a slurry, coal is separated from non-combustible components and can be fractionated by particle size as well. Coal slurry can be transferred by pipeline or with specialized pumps such as a progressive cavity pump to pump the highly abrasive, corrosive and viscous coal slurry. More than 7 billion tons of coal are mined per year (2010), using approximately 200 litres of water per ton. However, the amount of water required hinges on the surface characteristics of the coal being used."
 Preparation ,,"Most coal slurries require the addition of a surfactant to reduce the viscosity, ergo reduce the stress on pipelines and pumps.Recent studies have employed new methods of slurry preparation, like using ultrasonic irradiation and a mixture of natural and synthetic surfactants to improve the stability and rheological properties of coal slurry. Ideally, coal slurry consists only of crushed coal and water, which can be efficiently separated. In practice, the separation is significantly costly due to the large amounts of water needed and wastewater generated by the process."
 Preparation ,,"Furthermore, the slurry consists also of very fine coal dust that results in a waste called blackwater. As blackwater cannot be purified by a water treatment plant, it is stored in large impoundment ponds. Such ponds are susceptible to disastrous releases, such as the Buffalo Creek flood of 1972 or the Martin County coal slurry spill of 2000, which released over 250 million gallons of coal slurry. Coal slurry can contain hazardous chemicals such as arsenic and mercury and can kill aquatic wildlife, as was the case in the Martin County spill."
 Preparation ,,This impounded liquid waste can sometimes total billions of gallons in a single facility. Coal-water slurry fuel Pulverized coal Sludge (film) Tailings dam
 Processing , Dry ,"The coffee cherries are dried immediately after they are harvested through sun drying, solar drying or artificial drying. In sun drying, the coffee cherries are placed on a clean floor and left to dry in the open air. In solar drying, the cherries are placed in a closed cabinet, which has ventilation holes to let moisture out. Artificial drying is used mostly during the wet season, when the low level of sunlight extends the time needed for solar drying and the cherries are prone to mold growth. After being dried, the cherries are hulled."
 Processing , Dry ,"In this process the dried outer layer of the cherry, known as the pericarp, is removed mechanically."
 Processing , Semi-washed ,"In semi-washed processing, the cherries are de-pulped to remove the pericarp. After this the slimy mucilage layer which covers the bean is removed. This is done mechanically by feeding the beans into a cylindrical device which conveys them upward. While the friction and pressure exerted on the beans by this process is enough to remove most of the mucilage, a small amount of it will still remain in the centre-cut of the beans. This technique is used in Colombia and Mexico in order to reduce the water consumption from the long fermentation process and the extensive washing."
 Processing , Becolsub ,"In order to reduce the contamination generated by the wet process of coffee fruits, scientists at Cenicafé developed a technology that avoids using water when not needed and uses the right water when needed. The technology, called Becolsub (taken from the initials of the Spanish for ecological wet coffee process with by-products handling: Beneficio Ecologicos Sub-productos), controls more than 90% of the contamination generated by its predecessor. The quality of the coffee processed this way is the same as for coffee processed by natural fermentation."
 Processing , Becolsub ,"The Becolsub technology consists of pulping without water, mechanical demucilaging and mixing the by-products (fruit outer-skin and mucilage) in a screw conveyor. The technology also includes a hydromechanical device to remove floating fruits and light impurities, as well as heavy and hard objects, and a cylindrical screen to remove the fruits whose skin was not separated in the pulping machine."
 Processing , Becolsub ,"Scientists at Cenicafé discovered that a coffee fruit with mucilage (immature and dry fruits have no mucilage) has enough water inside for the skin and seeds to be separated in conventional pulping machines without water, that the liquid was only required as a conveying means and that pulping without water avoids 72% of the potential contamination. Mucilage removal has been done through a fermenting process, which takes between 14 and 18 hours, until the mucilage is degraded and can easily be removed with water. Washing fermented mucilage requires, in the best case, 5.0 L/kg of DPC."
 Processing , Becolsub ,"Scientists at Cenicafé developed a machine to remove the mucilage covering the coffee seeds. This machine, called Deslim (the initial letters of the Spanish demucilager, the mechanical washer and cleaner) removes more than 98% of the total mucilage (same as a well conducted fermentation) by exerting stress and generating collisions among beans, using only 0.7 L/kg of DPC. The resulting highly concentrated mixture of water, mucilage and impurities is viscous and is added to the separated fruit skin in a screw conveyor. In the screw conveyor the retention is greater than 60%, which means a 20% additional control of potential contamination."
 Processing , Becolsub ,"The two by-products are widely used as worms' substrate to produce natural fertilizers. However, the high concentration of the mucilage obtained from the demucilager provides opportunity for industrializing the by-product."
 Processing , Fully washed ,"This process is mainly used when processing Coffea arabica. After de-pulping, the beans are collected in fermentation tanks where bacterial removal of the mucilage takes place over 12 to 36 hours. The fermentation phase is important in the development of the flavour of the coffee, which is partially due to the microbiological processes that take place. The emergence of yeasts and moulds in acidic water can lead to off-flavors like sour coffee and onion-flavour."
 Processing , Fully washed ,"However, wet processing is believed to yield higher quality coffee than the other processes since small amounts of off-flavors give the coffee its particular taste and ""body"".When fermentation is complete, the beans are washed thoroughly to remove fermentation residues and any remaining mucilage. If not removed, these cause decolouring of the parchment and make the beans susceptible to yeasts. After washing, the beans are dried. When the drying process is not rapid enough earthy and musty taints, like Rio-flavor come up. The amount of water used in processing depends strongly on the type of processing."
 Processing , Fully washed ,"Wet fully washed processing of the coffee cherries requires the most fresh water, dry processing the least. Sources indicate a wide range in water use. Recycling of water in the de-pulping process can drastically reduce the amount needed. With reuse and improved washing techniques, up to 1 to 6 m3 water per tonne of fresh coffee cherry is achievable; without reuse a consumption of up to 20 m3/tonne is possible."
 Water usage , General ,"Water used in processing coffee leaves the coffee processing unit with high levels of pollution. The main component is organic matter, stemming from de-pulping and mucilage removal. The majority of organic material in the wastewater is highly resistant and COD values, the amount oxygen required to stabilize organic matter by using a strong oxidant, make up 80% of the pollution load, with values as high as 50 g/L."
 Water usage , General ,"The BOD, the amount of oxygen required for the biological decomposition of organic matter under aerobic conditions at a standardized temperature and time of incubation, coming from biodegradable organic material can reach values of 20 g/L. With a (rough) screening and removal of the pulp COD and BOD values become considerably lower. Values in the range of 3–5 g/L for COD and 1.5–3 g/L for BOD5 were found. Recorded values of 2.5 g/L for COD and 1.5 g/L for BOD5.A large part of the organic matter, pectins, precipitates as mucilated solids and could be taken out of the water."
 Water usage , General ,"When these solids are not removed and pH values rise and an increase in COD can be observed. In order to optimize the anaerobic processing of the wastewater pH values should be between 6.5 and 7.5, instead of the generally present values of pH=4, which is highly acidic. This is obtained by adding calcium hydroxide (CaOH2) to the wastewater. This resulted in a regained solubility of the pectins, raising COD from an average of 3.7 g/L to an average of 12.7 g/L. The water is further characterised by the presence of flavonoid compounds, coming from the skin of the cherries."
 Water usage , General ,"Flavonoid compounds result in dark colouration of the water at a pH=7 or higher, but they do not add to BOD or COD levels of the wastewater, nor have major environmental impacts. Lower levels of transparency, however, can have a negative impact on photosynthetic processes and growth and nutrient transformations by (especially) rooted water plants. Many efforts in olive and wine processing industries, with relatively large funds for research, have been trying to find a solution for this problem."
 Water usage , General ,"Calvert mentions research done into the removal of polyphenolics and flavonoid compounds by species of wood digesting fungi (Basidiomycetes) in a submerged solution with aeration using compressed air. These complex processes seemed to be able to remove the colour compounds, but simplified, cheaper techniques using other types of fungi (i.e. Geotrichum, Penicillium, Aspergillus) only thrived in highly diluted wastewaters. Coffee wastewater is not a constant flow of water with uniform loadings of contamination. The processing of coffee cherries is a batch process and regarding water flows, two processes can be determined: de-pulping and fermentation/washing."
 Water usage , De-pulping ,"The water used for de-pulping of the cherries is referred to as pulping water. It accounts for just over half of the water used in the process. According to Von Enden and Calvert, ""pulping water consists of quickly fermenting sugars from both pulp and mucilage components. Pulp and mucilage consists to a large extent of proteins, sugars and the mucilage in particular of pectins, i.e. polysaccharide carbohydrates. These sugars are fermenting using the enzymes from the bacteria on the cherries. Other components in pulping water are acids and toxic chemicals like polyphenolics (tannins) or alkaloids (caffeine)."
 Water usage , De-pulping ,"Pulping water can be reused during the de-pulping of the harvest of one day. This results in an increase in organic matter and a decrease in pH. Research in Nicaragua showed COD averages rising from 5,400 mg/L up to 8,400 mg/L with most of the pulp removed. The drop in pH can be attributed to the start of fermentation of the pulping water. This drop continues until fermentation is finished and pH levels of around 4 are reached."
 Water usage , De-pulping ,"The nutrient content of the pulping water at the maximum COD load, which was considered to reflect maximum pollution, was determined during this research. Total nitrogen (TN) concentration in the samples ranged from 50 to 110 mg/L with an average over all samples of 90 mg/L. Total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the samples ranged from 8.9 to 15.2 mg/L with an average over all samples of 12.4 mg/L."
 Water usage , Washing ,"Washing of the fermented beans leads to wastewater containing mainly pectins from the mucilage, proteins and sugars. The fermentation of the sugars (disaccharide carbohydrates) into ethanol and CO2 leads to acid conditions in the washing water. The ethanol is converted in acetic acids after reaction with oxygen, lowering the pH to levels of around 4. The high acidity can negatively affect the treatment efficiency of treatment facilities treating the coffee wastewater like an anaerobic reactor or constructed wetlands and is considered to be detrimental for aquatic life when discharged directly into surface waters."
 Water usage , Washing ,"During the washing process the research in Nicaragua showed a clear decrease in contamination of the wastewater. The COD values drop from an average of 7,200 mg/L to less than 50 mg/L. Despite the fact that wastewater with COD values below 200 mg/L is allowed to be discharged in the natural waterways in Nicaragua it is advisable to redirect all the wastewater to the treatment system. This is because COD levels cannot be determined onsite during the washing process and discharge of the wastewater into surface waters is based on visual inspection."
 Water usage , Washing ,"When the water is ""clear"" it is considered to be clean enough but the COD values measured during the research showed that discharge generally was to soon, resulting in wastewater with higher levels of COD than permitted. Another positive effect of diverting the wastewater to a treatment system is the dilution of the wastewater which enables better treatment by anaerobic bacteria due to more favourable pH values and better post-treatment due to lower concentrations of ammonium. TN concentration in the samples of wastewater stemming from washing ranged from 40 to 150 mg/L with an average over all samples of 110 mg/L."
 Water usage , Washing ,"TP concentration in the samples ranged from 7.8 to 15.8 mg/L with an average over all samples of 10.7 mg/L. Guideline for Discharge of Industrial Effluent Characteristics.

 Classifying toxic materials ,,"Toxic materials are poisonous byproducts as a result of industries such as manufacturing, farming, construction, automotive, laboratories, and hospitals which may contain heavy metals, radiation, dangerous pathogens, or other toxins. Toxic waste has become more abundant since the industrial revolution, causing serious global issues. Disposing of such waste has become even more critical with the addition of numerous technological advances containing toxic chemical components. Products such as cellular telephones, computers, televisions, and solar panels contain toxic chemicals that can harm the environment if not disposed of properly to prevent the pollution of the air and contamination of soils and water."
 Classifying toxic materials ,,"A material is considered toxic when it causes death or harm by being inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through the skin. The waste can contain chemicals, heavy metals, radiation, dangerous pathogens, or other toxins. Even households generate hazardous waste from items such as batteries, used computer equipment, and leftover paints or pesticides. Toxic material can be either human-made and others are naturally occurring in the environment. Not all hazardous substances are considered toxic."
 Classifying toxic materials ,,"The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has identified 11 key substances that pose a risk to human health: Arsenic: used in making electrical circuits, as an ingredient in pesticides, and as a wood preservative. It is classified as a carcinogen. Asbestos: is a material that was once used for the insulation of buildings, and some businesses are still using this material to manufacture roofing materials and brakes. Inhalation of asbestos fibers can lead to lung cancer and asbestosis. Cadmium: is found in batteries and plastics. It can be inhaled through cigarette smoke or digested when included as a pigment in food."
 Classifying toxic materials ,,"Exposure leads to lung damage, irritation of the digestive tract, and kidney disease. Chromium: is used as brick lining for high-temperature industrial furnaces, as a solid metal used for making steel, and in chrome plating, manufacturing dyes and pigments, wood preserving, and leather tanning. It is known to cause cancer, and prolonged exposure can cause chronic bronchitis and damage lung tissue. Clinical wastes: such as syringes and medication bottles can spread pathogens and harmful microorganisms, leading to a variety of illnesses. Cyanide: a poison found in some pesticides and rodenticides."
 Classifying toxic materials ,,"In large doses, it can lead to paralysis, convulsions, and respiratory distress. Lead: is found in batteries, paints, and ammunition. When ingested or inhaled can cause harm to the nervous and reproductive systems, and kidneys. Mercury: used for dental fillings and batteries. It is also used in the production of chlorine gas. Exposure can lead to birth defects and kidney and brain damage PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, are used in many manufacturing processes, by the utility industry, and in paints and sealants. Damage can occur through exposure, affecting the nervous, reproductive, and immune systems, as well as the liver."
 Classifying toxic materials ,,"POPs, persistent organic pollutants. They are found in chemicals and pesticides and may lead to nervous and reproductive system defects. They can bio-accumulate in the food chain or persist in the environment and be moved great distances through the atmosphere. Strong acids and alkalis used in manufacturing and industrial production. They can destroy tissue and cause internal damage to the body.The most overlooked toxic and hazardous wastes are the household products in everyday homes that are improperly disposed of such as old batteries, pesticides, paint, and car oil. Toxic waste can be reactive, ignitable, and corrosive."
 Classifying toxic materials ,,"In the United States, these wastes are regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Reactive wastes are those that can cause explosions when heated, mixed with water or compressed. They can release toxic gases into the air. They are unstable even in normal conditions. An example is lithium–sulfur batteries. Ignitable wastes have flash points of less than 60 degrees Celsius. They are very combustible and can cause fires. Examples are solvents and waste oils. Corrosive wastes are liquids capable of corroding metal containers."
 Classifying toxic materials ,,"These are acids or bases that have pH levels of less than or equal to 2, or greater than or equal to 12.5. An example is battery acid.With the increase of worldwide technology, there are more substances that are considered toxic and harmful to human health. Technology growth at this rate is extremely daunting for civilization and can eventually lead to more harm/negative outcomes. Some of this technology includes cell phones and computers. Such items have been given the name e-waste or EEE, which stands for Electrical and Electronic Equipment."
 Classifying toxic materials ,,"This term is also used for goods such as refrigerators, toys, and washing machines. These items can contain toxic components that can break down into water systems when discarded. The reduction in the cost of these goods has allowed for these items to be distributed globally without thought or consideration to managing the goods once they become ineffective or broken. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state environmental agencies develop and enforce regulations on the storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste."
 Classifying toxic materials ,,"The EPA requires that toxic waste be handled with special precautions, and be disposed of in designated facilities around the country. Also, many US cities have collection days where household toxic waste is gathered. Some materials that may not be accepted at regular landfills are ammunition, commercially generated waste, explosives/shock sensitive items, hypodermic needles/syringes, medical waste, radioactive materials, and smoke detectors. Toxic wastes often contain carcinogens, and exposure to these by some route, such as leakage or evaporation from the storage, causes cancer to appear at increased frequency in exposed individuals."
 Classifying toxic materials ,,"For example, a cluster of the rare blood cancer polycythemia vera was found around a toxic waste dump site in northeast Pennsylvania in 2008.The Human & Ecological Risk Assessment Journal conducted a study that focused on the health of individuals living near municipal landfills to see if it would be as harmful as living near hazardous landfills. They conducted a 7-year study that specifically tested for 18 types of cancers to see if the participants had higher rates than those that don't live around landfills."
 Classifying toxic materials ,,"They conducted this study in western Massachusetts within a 1-mile radius of the North Hampton Regional Landfill.People encounter these toxins buried in the ground, in stream runoff, in groundwater that supplies drinking water, or in floodwaters, as happened after Hurricane Katrina. Some toxins, such as mercury, persist in the environment and accumulate. As a result of the bioaccumulation of mercury in both freshwater and marine ecosystems, predatory fish are a significant source of mercury in human and animal diets."
 Health effects , Prevalence of Toxic Waste Sites in the United States ,In the United States today millions of Americans live near a toxic waste site that is in a radius of three miles of where they currently reside.

 Health effects , Prevalence of Toxic Waste Sites in the United States ,"it was found that ""Black Americans are 75 percent more likely to live near waste-producing facilities."" Residents that live in or near communities that are 1.8 miles around a Superfund or hazardous site have a ""high risk for life-long and long-term mental health and physical health challenges, including cancer, birth defects, and developmental disabilities."" There are an estimated 21 million people that reside within a mile of these sites allowing the harsh chemicals and toxins, such as lead and mercury, that have escaped to enter nearby water supplies, to affect the air quality, and ground conditions resulting in destructive environmental surroundings."
 Health effects , Prevalence of Toxic Waste Sites in the United States ,"In the past, recent years' climate change increasing severe rainstorms, flooding, and winds from hurricanes have a greater possibility to disrupt the content of these toxic waste sites allowing unstable organic compounds to go back into the environment."
 Health effects , Toxic Lead Waste and Disease in Three Latin American Countries ,"It can be seen that in Argentina, Mexico, and Uruguay there has been an increase in industrial development, urbanization, and socioeconomic forces. As these industries grow there is an underlying consequence of pollution that comes from environmental exposure to hazardous waste. When people are exposed to this pollution, they suffer negative health effects. With diseases on the rise, the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) starts to decline, so the time the average person lives decreases, especially in low to middle-income countries."
 Health effects , Toxic Lead Waste and Disease in Three Latin American Countries ,"These low to middle-income countries (LMIC) have minimal resources to deal with toxic waste, such as ""inadequate regulation, the informality of many industries, poor surveillance, and improper disposal of contaminants."" For example, ""lead is still used for glazing artisanal ceramics despite the availability of less hazardous alternatives."" Lead enters the soil and water sources if not kept under control."
 Health effects , Toxic Lead Waste and Disease in Three Latin American Countries ,"Children are more susceptible than adults to absorbing more lead if exposed early on, causing them to have ""behavioral problems in adolescence, IQ decrements, cognitive impairment, and decreased visuospatial skills."" If adults are exposed occupationally, they can have higher rates of hypertension than the average person. Men can result in low sperm count and females can result in miscarriages. In order to further quantify the burden of diseases caused by toxic wastes TSIP, Toxic Sites Identification Program, "" identifies active and abandoned hazardous waste sites resulting from both formal and informal industrial activities in LMICs""."
 Health effects , Toxic Lead Waste and Disease in Three Latin American Countries ,"As an investigation begins a key pollutant is sought out and identified. For example, ""Heavy metals are the most commonly occurring key pollutant, with ingestion of contaminated soils being the most commonly occurring route of exposure listed in the TSIP database."" Argentina, Mexico, and Uruguay were chosen since they had more available data after meeting certain criteria."
 Health effects , Toxic Lead Waste and Disease in Three Latin American Countries ,"As of now, there are five criteria that have to be met in order for a hazardous waste site to be included in the analysis; ""a biological or environmental sample had to be present; a population at risk had to be specified; the location of the site was represented by GPS coordinates, and a description of the activities leading to contamination were outlined."" To measure the amount of lead in the soil a handheld X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer was used."
 Health effects , Toxic Lead Waste and Disease in Three Latin American Countries ,"When this method seemed unavailable and an area was suspected of having to lead contamination, the blood of individuals was tested to show the amount the people who were exposed to lead. The exposure data were collected from a total of 129 hazardous waste sites distributed across Argentina (n = 23), Mexico (n = 62), and Uruguay (n = 44). In Figs. 1 and 2 the sites of geographical distributions are shown."
 Health effects , Toxic Lead Waste and Disease in Three Latin American Countries ,"An estimated population of 316,703 individuals were at risk of exposure (mean = 2455; median = 250 per site), which is approximately 0.19% of the total population of all three countries. There was an estimation of 80,021 individuals who were women of childbearing age (15–49 years of age), and 122,084 individuals who were younger than 18 years of age."
 Health effects ," Dioxins and Solid Waste Disposal in Campania, Italy ","In recent years in the region of Campania, Italy there has been a rise in illegal dumping and burning of toxic and solid waste. In response to this, there has been a rise of dangerous chemical molecules like dioxins that are carcinogenic, which implies that they have the potential to cause cancer, that is appearing in humans and animals."
 Health effects ," Dioxins and Solid Waste Disposal in Campania, Italy ","For example, there has been a recent increase in sheep that have been born in contaminated areas that have, ""higher rates of chromosome fragility, higher mortality, and a higher incidence of abnormal fetal development when compared with sheep raised in non-contaminated areas."" To assess the causal relations between cancer mortality and congenital malformations in humans coming from illegal dumping a map was drawn using the geographical locations of the sites. As one can see most of these sites are located in Campania where Naples and Caserta are based."
 Health effects ," Dioxins and Solid Waste Disposal in Campania, Italy ","The spread of dioxin through food consumption is primarily due to the animal products from the animals that were raised in the geographical locations where dioxins were the highest. Researchers tested mammalian milk from these areas and saw that the levels of dioxin were over the suggested amount. This was greatly seen as an issue because humans have the highest capability to concentrate the dioxin in their fat tissues. To test this, 94 women in Campania who were breastfeeding had samples of their breast milk tested and it was found that every woman had dioxin in their breast milk."
 Health effects ," Dioxins and Solid Waste Disposal in Campania, Italy ","A correlation was also discovered that the older you were the more dioxin was in your breast milk. One of the biggest problems with today's toxic material is how to dispose of it properly. Before the passage of modern environmental laws (in the US, this was in the 1970s), it was legal to dump such wastes into streams, rivers, and oceans, or bury them underground in landfills."
 Health effects ," Dioxins and Solid Waste Disposal in Campania, Italy ","The US Clean Water Act, enacted in 1972, and RCRA, enacted in 1976, created nationwide programs to regulate the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes.The agriculture industry uses over 800,000 tons of pesticides worldwide annually that contaminate soils, and eventually infiltrate into groundwater, which can contaminate drinking water supplies. The oceans can be polluted from the stormwater runoff of these chemicals as well. Toxic waste in the form of petroleum oil can either spill into the oceans from pipe leaks or large ships, but it can also enter the oceans from everyday citizens dumping car oil into the rainstorm sewer systems."
 Health effects ," Dioxins and Solid Waste Disposal in Campania, Italy ","Disposal is the placement of waste into or on the land. Disposal facilities are usually designed to permanently contain waste and prevent the release of harmful pollutants to the environment.The most common hazardous waste disposal practice is placement in a land disposal unit such as a landfill, surface impoundment, waste pile, land treatment unit, or injection well. Land disposal is subject to requirements under EPA's Land Disposal Restrictions Program. Injection wells are regulated under the federal Underground Injection Control program.Organic wastes can be destroyed by incineration at high temperatures."
 Health effects ," Dioxins and Solid Waste Disposal in Campania, Italy ","However, if the waste contains heavy metals or radioactive isotopes, these must be separated and stored, as they cannot be destroyed. The method of storage will seek to immobilize the toxic components of the waste, possibly through storage in sealed containers, inclusion in a stable medium such as glass or a cement mixture, or burial under an impermeable clay cap. Waste transporters and waste facilities may charge fees; consequently, improper methods of disposal may be used to avoid paying these fees."
 Health effects ," Dioxins and Solid Waste Disposal in Campania, Italy ","Where the handling of toxic waste is regulated, the improper disposal of toxic waste may be punishable by fines or prison terms. Burial sites for toxic waste and other contaminated brownfield land may eventually be used as greenspace or redeveloped for commercial or industrial use."
 Handling and disposal , History of US toxic waste regulation ,"The RCRA governs the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), also enacted in 1976, authorizes the EPA to collect information on all new and existing chemical substances, as well as to control any substances that were determined to cause unreasonable risk to public health or the environment. The Superfund law, passed in 1980, created a cleanup program for abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.There has been a long ongoing battle between communities and environmentalists versus governments and corporations about how strictly and how fairly the regulations and laws are written and enforced."
 Handling and disposal , History of US toxic waste regulation ,"That battle began in North Carolina in the late summer of 1979, as EPA's TSCA regulations were being implemented. In North Carolina, PCB-contaminated oil was deliberately dripped along rural Piedmont highways, creating the largest PCB spills in American history and a public health crisis that would have repercussions for generations to come. The PCB-contaminated material was eventually collected and buried in a landfill in Warren County, but citizens' opposition, including large public demonstrations, exposed the dangers of toxic waste, the fallibility of landfills than in use, and EPA regulations allowing landfills to be built on marginal, but politically acceptable sites."
 Handling and disposal , History of US toxic waste regulation ,"Warren County citizens argued that the toxic waste landfill regulations were based on the fundamental assumption that the EPA's conceptual dry-tomb landfill would contain the toxic waste. This assumption informed the siting of toxic waste landfills and waivers to regulations that were included in EPA's Federal Register. For example, in 1978, the base of a major toxic waste landfill could be no closer than five feet from groundwater, but this regulation and others could be waived."
 Handling and disposal , History of US toxic waste regulation ,The waiver to the regulation concerning the distance between the base of a toxic waste landfill and groundwater allowed the base to be only a foot above ground water if the owner/operator of the facility could demonstrate to the EPA regional administrator that a leachate collection system could be installed and that there would be no hydraulic connection between the base of the landfill and groundwater.
 Handling and disposal , History of US toxic waste regulation ,Citizens argued that the waivers to the siting regulations were discriminatory mechanisms facilitating the shift from scientific to political considerations concerning the siting decision and that in the South this would mean a discriminatory proliferation of dangerous waste management facilities in poor black and other minority communities. They also argued that the scientific consensus was that permanent containment could not be assured.
 Handling and disposal , History of US toxic waste regulation ,"As resistance to the siting of the PCB landfill in Warren County continued and studies revealed that EPA dry-tomb landfills were failing, EPA stated in its Federal Register that all landfills would eventually leak and should only be used as a stopgap measure. Years of research and empirical knowledge of the failures of the Warren County PCB landfill led citizens of Warren County to conclude that the EPA's dry-tomb landfill design and regulations governing the disposal of toxic and hazardous waste were not based on sound science and adequate technology."
 Handling and disposal , History of US toxic waste regulation ,"Warren County's citizens concluded also that North Carolina's 1981 Waste Management Act was scientifically and constitutionally unacceptable because it authorized the siting of toxic, hazardous, and nuclear waste facilities prior to public hearings, preempted local authority over the siting of the facilities, and authorized the use of force if needed.In the aftermath of the Warren County protests, the 1984 Federal Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act focused on waste minimization and phasing out land disposal of hazardous waste as well as corrective action for releases of hazardous materials."
 Handling and disposal , History of US toxic waste regulation ,"Other measures included in the 1984 amendments included increased enforcement authority for EPA, more stringent hazardous waste management standards, and a comprehensive underground storage tank program.The disposal of toxic waste continues to be a source of conflict in the U.S."
 Handling and disposal , History of US toxic waste regulation ,"Due to the hazards associated with toxic waste handling and disposal, communities often resist the siting of toxic waste landfills and other waste management facilities; however, determining where and how to dispose of waste is a necessary part of economic and environmental policy-making.The issue of handling toxic waste has become a global problem as international trade has arisen out of the increasing toxic byproducts produced with the transfer of them to less developed countries."
 Handling and disposal , History of US toxic waste regulation ,"In 1995, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights began to notice the illicit dumping of toxic waste and assigned a Special Rapporteur to examine the human rights aspect to this issue (Commission resolution 1995/81). In September 2011, the Human Rights Council decided to strengthen the mandate to include the entire life-cycle of hazardous products from manufacturing to the final destination (aka cradle to grave), as opposed to only movement and dumping of hazardous waste."
 Handling and disposal , History of US toxic waste regulation ,"The title of the Special Rapporteur has been changed to ""Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes"" (Human Rights Council 18/11). The Human Rights Council has further extended the scope of its mandates as of September 2012 due to the result of the dangerous implications occurring to persons advocating environmentally sound practices regarding the generation, management, handling, distribution, and final disposal of hazardous and toxic materials to include the issue of the protection of the environmental human rights defenders."

 Production ,,"Red mud is a side-product of the Bayer process, the principal means of refining bauxite en route to alumina. The resulting alumina is the raw material for producing aluminium by the Hall–Héroult process. A typical bauxite plant produces one to two times as much red mud as alumina. This ratio is dependent on the type of bauxite used in the refining process and the extraction conditions.More than 60 manufacturing operations across the world use the Bayer process to make alumina from bauxite ore. Bauxite ore is mined, normally in open cast mines, and transferred to an alumina refinery for processing."
 Production ,,"The alumina is extracted using sodium hydroxide under conditions of high temperature and pressure. The insoluble part of the bauxite (the residue) is removed, giving rise to a solution of sodium aluminate, which is then seeded with an aluminium hydroxide crystal and allowed to cool which causes the remaining aluminium hydroxide to precipitate from the solution. Some of the aluminium hydroxide is used to seed the next batch, while the remainder is calcined (heated) at over 1000 °C in rotary kilns or fluid flash calciners to produce aluminium oxide (alumina)."
 Production ,,"The alumina content of the bauxite used is normally between 42 and 50%, but ores with a wide range of alumina contents can be used. The aluminium compound may be present as gibbsite (Al(OH)3), boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)) or diaspore (α-AlO(OH)). The residue invariably has a high concentration of iron oxide which gives the product a characteristic red colour. A small residual amount of the sodium hydroxide used in the process remains with the residue, causing the material to have a high pH/alkalinity, normally >12."
 Production ,,"Various stages of solid/liquid separation processes recycle as much sodium hydroxide as possible from the residue back into the Bayer Process, in order to reduce production costs and make the process as efficient as possible. This also lowers the final alkalinity of the residue, making it easier and safer to handle and store. Red mud is composed of a mixture of solid and metallic oxides. The red colour arises from iron oxides, which can comprise up to 60% of the mass. The mud is highly basic with a pH ranging from 10 to 13."
 Production ,,"In addition to iron, the other dominant components include silica, unleached residual aluminium compounds, and titanium oxide.The main constituents of the residue after the extraction of the aluminium component are insoluble metallic oxides. The percentage of these oxides produced by a particular alumina refinery will depend on the quality and nature of the bauxite ore and the extraction conditions."
 Production ,,"The table below shows the composition ranges for common chemical constituents, but the values vary widely: Mineralogically expressed the components present are: In general, the composition of the residue reflects that of the non-aluminium components, with the exception of part of the silicon component: crystalline silica (quartz) will not react but some of the silica present, often termed, reactive silica, will react under the extraction conditions and form sodium aluminium silicate as well as other related compounds."
 Composition , Environmental hazards ,"Discharge of red mud can be hazardous environmentally because of its alkalinity and species components. Until 1972, Italian company Montedison was discharging red mud off the coast of Corsica. The case is important in international law governing the Mediterranean sea.In October 2010, approximately one million cubic meters of red mud slurry from an alumina plant near Kolontár in Hungary was accidentally released into the surrounding countryside in the Ajka alumina plant accident, killing ten people and contaminating a large area."
 Composition , Environmental hazards ,"All life in the Marcal river was said to have been ""extinguished"" by the red mud, and within days the mud had reached the Danube. The long-term environmental effects of the spill have been minor after a €127 million remediation effort by the Hungarian government. Residue storage methods have changed substantially since the original plants were built. The practice in early years was to pump the slurry, at a concentration of about 20% solids, into lagoons or ponds sometimes created in former bauxite mines or depleted quarries."
 Composition , Environmental hazards ,"In other cases, impoundments were constructed with dams or levees, while for some operations valleys were dammed and the residue deposited in these holding areas.It was once common practice for the red mud to be discharged into rivers, estuaries, or the sea via pipelines or barges; in other instances the residue was shipped out to sea and disposed of in deep ocean trenches many kilometres offshore. From 2016, all disposal into the sea, estuaries and rivers was stopped.As residue storage space ran out and concern increased over wet storage, since the mid-1980s dry stacking has been increasingly adopted."
 Composition , Environmental hazards ,"In this method, residues are thickened to a high density slurry (48–55% solids or higher), and then deposited in a way that it consolidates and dries.An increasingly popular treatment process is filtration whereby a filter cake (typically resulting in 23–27% moisture) is produced. This cake can be washed with either water or steam to reduce alkalinity before being transported and stored as a semi-dried material. Residue produced in this form is ideal for reuse as it has lower alkalinity, is cheaper to transport, and is easier to handle and process."
 Composition , Environmental hazards ,"Another option for ensuring safe storage is to use amphirols to dewater the material once deposited and then 'conditioned' using farming equipment such as harrows to accelerate carbonation and thereby reduce the alkalinity. Bauxite residue produced after press filtration and 'conditioning as described above are classified as non-hazardous under the EU Waste Framework Directive. In 2013 Vedanta Aluminium, Ltd. commissioned a red mud powder-producing unit at its Lanjigarh refinery in Odisha, India, describing it as the first of its kind in the alumina industry, tackling major environmental hazards."
 Composition , Environmental hazards ,"Since the Bayer process was first adopted industrially in 1894, the value of the remaining oxides has been recognized. Attempts have been made to recover the principal components – especially the iron oxides. Since bauxite mining began, a large amount of research effort has been devoted to seeking uses for the residue. Many studies are now being financed by the European Union under the Horizon Europe programme. Several studies have been conducted to develop uses of red mud. An estimated 3 to 4 million tonnes are used annually in the production of cement, road construction and as a source for iron."
 Composition , Environmental hazards ,"Potential applications include the production of low cost concrete, application to sandy soils to improve phosphorus cycling, amelioration of soil acidity, landfill capping and carbon sequestration.Reviews describing the current use of bauxite residue in Portland cement clinker, supplementary cementious materials/blended cements and special calcium aluminate cements (CAC) and calcium sulfo-aluminate (CSA) cements have been extensively researched and documented. Cement manufacture, use in concrete as a supplementary cementitious material. From 500,000 to 1,500,000 tonnes.

 Etymology ,,"""Chaff"" comes from Middle English chaf, from Old English ceaf, related to Old High German cheva, ""husk"". In grasses (including cereals such as rice, barley, oats, and wheat), the ripe seed is surrounded by thin, dry, scaly bracts (called glumes, lemmas, and paleas), forming a dry husk (or hull) around the grain. Once it is removed, it is often referred to as chaff. In wild cereals and in the primitive domesticated einkorn, emmer and spelt wheats, the husks enclose each seed tightly. Before the grain can be used, the husks must be removed."
 Etymology ,,"The process of loosening the chaff from the grain so as to remove it is called ""threshing"" – traditionally done by milling or pounding. Separating remaining loose chaff from the grain is called ""winnowing"" – traditionally done by repeatedly tossing the grain up into a light wind, which gradually blows the lighter chaff away. This method typically uses a broad, plate-shaped basket or similar receptacle to hold and collect the winnowed grain as it falls back down.Domesticated grains such as durum and common wheat have been bred to have chaff that is easily removed."
 Etymology ,,"These varieties are known as ""free-threshing"" or ""naked"".Chaff should not be confused with bran, which is a finer, scaly material that is part of the grain itself. Chaff is also made by chopping straw (or sometimes coarse hay) into very short lengths, using a machine called a chaff cutter. Like grain chaff, it is used as animal feed, and is a way of turning coarse fodder into a form more palatable to livestock. In botany, chaff refers to the thin receptacular bracts of many species in the sunflower family Asteraceae and related families."
 Etymology ,,"They are modified scale-like leaves surrounding single florets in the flower-head. Chaff as a waste product from grain processing leads to a metaphorical use of the term, to refer to something seen as worthless. In the Bible, such use is found in Job 13:25, Isaiah 33:11, Psalm 83:13-15, and other places. Chaff also lends its name to a radar countermeasure, composed of small particles dropped from an aircraft. Hungarian engineer László Schremmer has discovered that the use of chaff-based filters can reduce the arsenic content of water to 3 microgram/litre."
 Etymology ,,This is especially important in areas where the potable water is provided by filtering the water extracted from an underground aquifer. Awn (botany) Bran Biomass Combine harvester Rice hulls Rice huller
 Composition , Variability in assessment ,"A comprehensive set of analyses of wood ash composition from many tree species has been carried out by Emil Wolff, among others. Several factors have a major impact on the composition: Fine ash: Some studies include the solids escaping via the flue during combustion, while others do not. Temperature of combustion. Ash content yield decreases with increasing combustion temperature which produces two direct effects:Dissociation: Conversion of carbonates, sulfides, etc., to oxides results in no carbon, sulfur, carbonates, or sulfides. Some metallic oxides (e.g."
 Composition , Variability in assessment ,"mercuric oxide) even dissociate to their elemental state and/or vaporize completely at wood fire temperatures (600 °C (1,112 °F).) Volatilization: In studies in which the escaped ash is not measured, some combustion products may not be present at all. Arsenic for example is not volatile, but arsenic trioxide is (boiling point: 465 °C (869 °F)). Experimental process: If the ashes are exposed to the environment between combustion and the analysis, oxides may convert back to carbonates by reacting with carbon dioxide in the air. Hygroscopic substances meanwhile may absorb atmospheric moisture."
 Composition , Variability in assessment ,"Type, age, and growing environment of the wood stock affect the composition of the wood (e.g. hardwood and softwood), and thus the ash. Hardwoods usually produce more ash than softwoods with bark and leaves producing more than internal parts of the trunk."
 Composition , Measurements ,"According to one research on the average the burning of wood results in about 6–10% ashes. The residue ash of 0.43 and 1.82 percent of the original mass of burned wood (assuming dry basis, meaning that H2O is driven off) is produced for certain woods if it is pyrolized until all volatiles disappear and it is burned at 350 °C (662 °F) for 8 hours. Also the conditions of the combustion affect the composition and amount of the residue ash, thus higher temperature will reduce the ash yield."
 Composition , Elemental analysis ,"Typically, wood ash contains the following major elements: Carbon (C) — 5–30%. Calcium (Ca) — 7–33% Potassium (K) — 3–4% Magnesium (Mg) — 1–2% Manganese (Mn) — 0.3–1.3% Phosphorus (P) — 0.3–1.4% Sodium (Na) — 0.2–0.5%."
 Composition , Chemical compounds ,"As the wood burns, it produces different compounds depending on the temperature used. Some studies cite calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as the major constituent, others find no carbonate at all but calcium oxide (CaO) instead. The latter is produced at higher temperatures (see calcination)."
 Composition , Chemical compounds ,"The equilibrium reaction CaCO3 → CO2 + CaO has its equilibrium shifted leftward at 750 °C (1,380 °F) and high CO2 partial pressure (such as in a wood fire) but shifted rightward at 900 °C (1,650 °F) or when CO2 partial pressure is reduced.Much of wood ash contains calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as its major component, representing 25% or even 45% of total ash weight. At 600 °C (1,112 °F) CaCO3 and K2CO3 were identified in one case. Less than 10% is potash, and less than 1% is phosphate."
 Composition , Trace elements ,"There are trace elements of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and some heavy metals. Their concentrations in ash vary due combustion temperature. Decomposition of carbonates and the volatilization of potassium (K), sulfur (S), and trace amounts of copper (Cu) and boron (B) may result from increased temperature. The study has found that at raised temperature K, S, B, sodium (Na) and copper (Cu) decreased, whereas Mg, P, Mn, Al, Fe, and Si did not change relative to calcium (Ca). All of these trace elements are, however, present in the form of oxides at higher temperature of combustion."
 Composition , Trace elements ,Some elements in wood ash (all fractions given in mass of elements per mass of ash) include:: 304 Fe 1.6-55 ‰ Si 6-170 ‰ Al 1.2-45 ‰ Mn 1-20 ‰ As 0.6-50 ppm Cd 0.18-60 ppm Pb 2-500 ppm Cr 12-280 ppm Ni 10-140 ppm V 1.8-120 ppm
 Composition , Fuels ,"One study has determined that a slowly burning wood (100–200 °C (212–392 °F) ) emissions typically include 16 alkenes, 5 alkadienes, 5 alkynes and several alkanes and arenes in proportions. Ethene, acetylene and benzene were a major part at efficient combustion. Proportion of C3-C7 alkenes were found to be higher for smouldering. Benzene and 1,3-butadiene constituted ~10–20% and ~1–2% by mass of total non-methane hydrocarbons."
 Uses , Fertilizers ,"Wood ash can be used as a fertilizer used to enrich agricultural soil nutrition. In this role, wood ash serves as a source of potassium and calcium carbonate, the latter acting as a liming agent to neutralize acidic soils.Wood ash can also be used as an amendment for organic hydroponic solutions, generally replacing inorganic compounds containing calcium, potassium, magnesium and phosphorus."
 Uses , Composts ,"Wood ash is commonly disposed of in landfills, but with rising disposal costs, ecologically friendly alternatives, such as serving as compost for agricultural and forestry applications, are becoming more popular. Because wood ash has a high char content, it can be used as an odor control agent, especially in composting operations."
 Uses , Pottery ,"Wood ash has a very long history of being used in ceramic glazes, particularly in the Chinese, Japanese and Korean traditions, though now used by many craft potters. It acts as a flux, reducing the melting point of the glaze."
 Uses , Soaps ,"For thousands of years, plant or wood ash was leached with water, to yield an impure solution of potassium carbonate. This product could be mixed with oils or fats to produce a soft ""soap"" or soap like-product, as was done in ancient Sumeria, Europe, and Egypt. However only certain types of plants could produce a soap that actually lathered. Later, medieval European soapmakers treated the wood ash solution with slaked lime, which contains calcium hydroxide, to get a hydroxide-rich solution for soapmaking."
 Uses , Soaps ,"However it was not until the invention of the Leblanc process that high quality sodium hydroxide could be mass produced, rendering obsolete the earlier forms of soap using crude wood or plant ash. This was a revolutionary discovery that facilitated the modern soapmaking industry."
 Uses , Bio-leaching ,The ectomycorrhizal fungi Suillus granulatus and Paxillus involutus can release elements from wood ash.
 Uses , Food preparation ,"Wood ash is sometimes used in the process of nixtamalization, where corn is soaked and cooked in an alkali solution to improve nutritional content and decrease risk of mycotoxins. The alkali solution has historically been made from wood ash lye. An early leavened bread was baked as early as 6000 BC by the Sumerians by placing the bread on heated stones and covering it with hot ash. The minerals in the wood ash could have supplemented the nutritional content of the dough as it was baked."
 Uses , Food preparation ,"In present day, the amount of wood ash content in bread flour, as measured by the Chopin alveograph, is strictly regulated by France. Ash burner (traditional occupation) Bottom ash Charcoal Fly ash Ashery – A location or factory producing lye from wood ash"
 Formation ,,"Two waste products, dust and chips, form at the working surface during woodworking operations such as sawing, milling and sanding. These operations both shatter lignified wood cells and break out whole cells and groups of cells. Shattering of wood cells creates dust, while breaking out of whole groups of wood cells creates chips. The more cell-shattering that occurs, the finer the dust particles that are produced. For example, sawing and milling are mixed cell shattering and chip forming processes, whereas sanding is almost exclusively cell shattering."
 Formation ,,"A major use of sawdust is for particleboard; coarse sawdust may be used for wood pulp. Sawdust has a variety of other practical uses, including serving as a mulch, as an alternative to clay cat litter, or as a fuel. Until the advent of refrigeration, it was often used in icehouses to keep ice frozen during the summer. It has been used in artistic displays, and as scatter in miniature railroad and other models. It is also sometimes used to soak up liquid spills, allowing the spill to be easily collected or swept aside."
 Formation ,,"As such, it was formerly common on barroom floors. It is used to make Cutler's resin. Mixed with water and frozen, it forms pykrete, a slow-melting, much stronger form of ice. Sawdust is used in the manufacture of charcoal briquettes. The claim for invention of the first commercial charcoal briquettes goes to Henry Ford who created them from the wood scraps and sawdust produced by his automobile factory."
 Uses , Food ,"Cellulose, fibre starch that is indigestible to humans, and a filler in some low calorie foods, can be and is made from sawdust, as well as from other plant sources. While there is no documentation for the persistent rumor, based upon Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle, that sawdust was used as a filler in sausage, cellulose derived from sawdust was and is used for sausage casings. Sawdust-derived cellulose has also been used as a filler in bread.When cereals were scarce, sawdust was sometimes an ingredient in kommissbrot. Auschwitz concentration camp survivor, Dr."
 Uses , Food ,"Miklós Nyiszli, reports in Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account that the subaltern medical staff, who served Dr. Josef Mengele, subsisted on ""bread made from wild chestnuts sprinkled with sawdust"". Airborne sawdust and sawdust accumulations present a number of health and safety hazards. Wood dust becomes a potential health problem when, for example, the wood particles, from processes such as sanding, become airborne and are inhaled. Wood dust is a known human carcinogen. Certain woods and their dust contain toxins that can produce severe allergic reactions.Breathing airborne wood dust may cause allergic respiratory symptoms, mucosal and non-allergic respiratory symptoms, and cancer."
 Uses , Food ,"In the US, lists of carcinogenic factors are published by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). All these organisations recognize wood dust as carcinogenic in relation to the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses. People can be exposed to wood dust in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact."
 Uses , Food ,"The OSHA has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for wood dust exposure in the workplace as 15 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. The NIOSH has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday.Water-borne bacteria digest organic material in leachate, but use up much of the available oxygen. This high biochemical oxygen demand can suffocate fish and other organisms."
 Uses , Food ,"There is an equally detrimental effect on beneficial bacteria, so it is not at all advisable to use sawdust within home aquariums, as was once done by hobbyists seeking to save some expense on activated carbon."
 Health hazards , Explosions and fire ,Sawdust is flammable and accumulations provide a ready source of fuel. Airborne sawdust can be ignited by sparks or even heat accumulation and result in dust fire or explosions.
 Health hazards , Environmental effects ,"At sawmills, unless reprocessed into particleboard, burned in a sawdust burner, or used to make heat for other milling operations, sawdust may collect in piles and add harmful leachates into local water systems, creating an environmental hazard. This has placed small sawyers and environmental agencies in a deadlock. Questions about the science behind the determination of sawdust being an environmental hazard remain for sawmill operators (though this is mainly with finer particles), who compare wood residuals to dead trees in a forest."
 Health hazards , Environmental effects ,"Technical advisors have reviewed some of the environmental studies, but say most lack standardized methodology or evidence of a direct impact on wildlife. They do not take into account large drainage areas, so the amount of material that is getting into the water from the site in relation to the total drainage area is minuscule.Other scientists have a different view, saying the ""dilution is the solution to pollution"" argument is no longer accepted in environmental science. The decomposition of a tree in a forest is similar to the impact of sawdust, but the difference is of scale."
 Health hazards , Environmental effects ,"Sawmills may be storing thousands of cubic metres of wood residues in one place, so the issue becomes one of concentration.Of larger concern are substances such as lignins and fatty acids that protect trees from predators while they are alive, but can leach into water and poison wildlife. Those types of things remain in the tree and, as the tree decays, they slowly are broken down. But when sawyers are processing a large volume of wood and large concentrations of these materials permeate into the runoff, the toxicity they cause is harmful to a broad range of organisms."
 Health hazards , Environmental effects ,"Wood flour is finely pulverized wood that has a consistency fairly equal to sand or sawdust, but can vary considerably, with particles ranging in dimensions from a fine powder to roughly that of a grain of rice. Most wood flour manufacturers are able to create batches of wood flour that have the same consistency throughout. All high quality wood flour is made from hardwoods because of its durability and strength. Very low grade wood flour is occasionally made from sapless softwoods such as pine or fir."
 Wood flour , Applications ,"Wood flour is commonly used as a filler in thermosetting resins such as bakelite, and in linoleum floor coverings. Wood flour is also the main ingredient in wood/plastic composite building products such as decks and roofs. Prior to 1920, wood flour was used as the filler in ¼-inch thick Edison Diamond Discs.Wood flour has found a use in plugging small through-wall holes in leaking main condenser (heat exchanger) tubes at electrical power generating stations via injecting small quantities of the wood flour into the cooling water supply lines."
 Wood flour , Applications ,Some of the injected wood flour clogs the small holes while the remainder exits the station in a relatively environmentally benign fashion. Because of its adsorbent properties it has been used as a cleaning agent for removing grease or oil in various occupations. It has also been noted for its ability to remove lead contamination from water.Wood flour can be used as a binder in grain filler compounds.
 Wood flour , Sources ,Large quantities of wood flour are frequently to be found in the waste from woodworking and furniture companies. An adaptive reuse to which this material can be directed is composting. Wood flour can be subject to dust explosions if not cared for and disposed of properly.
 Wood flour , Respirable particulates ,"As with all airborne particulates, wood dust particle sizes are classified with regard to effect on the human respiratory system. For this classification, the unit for measurement of particle sizes is the micrometre or micron (μm), where 1 micrometre = 1 micron. Particles below 50 μm are not normally visible to the naked human eye. Particles of concern for human respiratory health are those <100 μm (where the symbol < means ‘less than’)."
 Wood flour , Respirable particulates ,"Zhang (2004) has defined the size of indoor particulates according to respiratory fraction: Particles which precipitate in the vicinity of the mouth and eyes, and get into the organism, are defined as the inhalable fraction, that is total dust. Smaller fractions, penetrating into the non-cartilage respiratory tract, are defined as respirable dust. Dust emitted in the wood industry is characterized by the dimensional disintegration of particles up to 5 μm, and that is why they precipitate mostly in the nasal cavity, increasing the risk of cancer of the upper respiratory tract."
 Wood flour , Exposure ,"The parameter most commonly used to characterize exposures to wood dust in air is total wood dust concentration, in mass per unit volume. In countries that use the metric system, this is usually measured in mg/m3 (milligram per cubic metre)A study to estimate occupational exposure to inhalable wood dust by country, industry, the level of exposure and type of wood dust in 25 member states of the European Union (EU-25) found that in 2000–2003, about 3.6 million workers (2.0% of the employed EU-25 population) were occupationally exposed to inhalable wood dust."
 Wood flour , Exposure ,The highest exposure levels were estimated to occur in the construction sector and furniture industry.
 Wood flour , Cancer ,"Wood dust is known to be a human carcinogen, based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans. It has been demonstrated through human epidemiologic studies that exposure to wood dust increases the occurrence of cancer of the nose (nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses). An association of wood dust exposure and cancers of the nose has been observed in numerous case reports, cohort studies, and case control studies specifically addressing nasal cancer. To lower the concentration of airborne dust concentrations during woodworking, dust extraction systems are used. These can be divided into two types."
 Wood flour , Cancer ,"The first are local exhaust ventilation systems, the second are room ventilation systems. Use of personal respirators, a form of personal protective equipment, can also isolate workers from dust."
 Ventilation , Local exhaust ,"Local exhaust ventilation (LEV) systems rely on air pulled with a suction force through piping systems from the point of dust formation to a waste disposal unit. They consist of four elements: dust hoods at the point of dust formation, ventilation ducts, an air cleaning device (waste separator or dust collector) and an air moving device (a fan, otherwise known as an impeller). The air, containing dust and chips from the woodworking operation, is sucked by an impeller. The impeller is usually built into, or placed close to, the waste disposal unit, or dust collector."
 Ventilation , Local exhaust ,"Guidelines of performance for woodworking LEV systems exist, and these tie into occupational air quality regulations that exist in many countries. The LEV guidelines often referred to are those set by the ACIAH."
 Ventilation , Low volume/high velocity ,"Low-volume/high-velocity (LVHV) capture systems are specialised types of LEV that use an extractor hood designed as an integral part of the tool or positioned very close to the operating point of the cutting tool. The hood is designed to provide high capture velocities, often greater than 50 m/s (10,000 fpm) at the contaminant release point. This high velocity is accompanied by airflows often less than 0.02m3/s (50 cfm) resulting from the small face area of the hood that is used. These systems have come into favour for portable power tools, although adoption of the technology is not widespread."
 Ventilation , Low volume/high velocity ,Festool is one manufacturer of portable power tools using LVHV ventilation integrated into the tool design.
 Ventilation , Room ,"If suitably designed, general ventilation can also be used as a control of airborne dust. General ventilation can often help reduce skin and clothing contamination, and dust deposition on surfaces.

 Background ,,"In 2007 and 2010 respectively, bars in the Swedish cities of Båstad and Visby, popular party destinations for the wealthy youth, banned the spraying of champagne. The ban referred to champagne spraying possibly violating the law’s requirement on servers of alcohol to maintain good order. The ban caused some people to sink the champagne instead, while others chose to buy more expensive champagne.According to Marie Söderqvist, CEO of the analysis company United Minds and author of the book Status – vägen till lycka (Eng."
 Background ,,"Status – the road to happiness), sinking is not just a protest against the ban on spraying champagne: ""One gives the finger to everything – bans, global justice, saving the planet and equality."" Sinking has been the subject of articles by national newspapers like Aftonbladet and Dagens Nyheter, but it is unclear how much sinking actually occurs."
 Background ,,"In a survey among barkeepers in Båstad, Stockholm, and Visby, one of them said they get ""approximately one serious sinking request per night,"" while others claimed sinking was a myth.Sinking has also been the theme of a music video by Kakan och Julia featured on Swedish Public Television.Variants of the phenomenon have reportedly taken place, such as hamburger dumping (purchasing a large number of hamburgers at a fast food restaurant, and throwing all but one into the trash). Conspicuous consumption"
 Nitrogen wastes ,,"The nitrogen compounds through which excess nitrogen is eliminated from organisms are called nitrogenous wastes () or nitrogen wastes. They are ammonia, urea, uric acid, and creatinine. All of these substances are produced from protein metabolism. In many animals, the urine is the main route of excretion for such wastes; in some, it is the feces."
 Nitrogen wastes , Ammonotelism ,"Ammonotelism is the excretion of ammonia and ammonium ions. Ammonia (NH3) forms with the oxidation of amino groups.(-NH2), which are removed from the proteins when they convert into carbohydrates. It is a very toxic substance to tissues and extremely soluble in water. Only one nitrogen atom is removed with it. A lot of water is needed for the excretion of ammonia, about 0.5 L of water is needed per 1 g of nitrogen to maintain ammonia levels in the excretory fluid below the level in body fluids to prevent toxicity."
 Nitrogen wastes , Ammonotelism ,"Thus, the marine organisms excrete ammonia directly into the water and are called ammonotelic. Ammonotelic animals include crustaceans, platyhelminths, cnidarians, poriferans, echinoderms, and other aquatic invertebrates."
 Nitrogen wastes , Ureotelism ,"The excretion of urea is called ureotelism. Land animals, mainly amphibians and mammals, convert ammonia into urea, a process which occurs in the liver and kidney. These animals are called ureotelic. Urea is a less toxic compound than ammonia; two nitrogen atoms are eliminated through it and less water is needed for its excretion. It requires 0.05 L of water to excrete 1 g of nitrogen, approximately only 10% of that required in ammonotelic organisms."
 Nitrogen wastes , Uricotelism ,"Uricotelism is the excretion of excess nitrogen in the form of uric acid. Uricotelic animals include insects, birds and most reptiles. Though requiring more metabolic energy to make than urea, uric acid's low toxicity and low solubility in water allow it to be concentrated into a small volume of pasty white suspension in feces, compared to the liquid urine of mammals. Notably however, great apes and humans, while ureotelic, are also uricotelic to a small extent, with uric acid potentially causing problems such as kidney stones and gout, but also functioning as a blood antioxidant."
 Nitrogen wastes , Uricotelism ,"These compounds form during the catabolism of carbohydrates and lipids in condensation reactions, and in some other metabolic reactions of the amino acids. Oxygen is produced by plants and some bacteria in photosynthesis, while CO2 is a waste product of all animals and plants. Nitrogen gases are produced by denitrifying bacteria and as a waste product, and bacteria for decaying yield ammonia, as do most invertebrates and vertebrates. Water is the only liquid waste from animals and photosynthesizing plants."
 Nitrogen wastes , Uricotelism ,"Nitrates and nitrites are wastes produced by nitrifying bacteria, just as sulfur and sulfates are produced by the sulfur-reducing bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Insoluble iron waste can be made by iron bacteria by using soluble forms. In plants, resins, fats, waxes, and complex organic chemicals are exuded from plants, e.g., the latex from rubber trees and milkweeds. Solid waste products may be manufactured as organic pigments derived from breakdown of pigments like hemoglobin, and inorganic salts like carbonates, bicarbonates, and phosphate, whether in ionic or in molecular form, are excreted as solids.Animals dispose of solid waste as feces."

 Risks ,,"Furniture, in particular bedding or upholstered items, may have bedbugs, if they have not been examined by an expert. Recycling goods through the secondhand market reduces use of resources in manufacturing new goods and diminishes waste which must be disposed of, both of which are significant environmental benefits.Another benefit of recycling clothes is for the creation for new pieces of clothing from combings parts of recycled clothes to make a whole new piece. This has been done by multiple fashion designers recently and has been growing in recent years. However, manufacturers who profit from sales of new goods lose corresponding sales."
 Risks ,,"Scientific research shows that buying used goods reduces carbon footprint and CO2 emissions significantly compared to the complete product life cycle, because of less production, raw material sourcing and logistics. Often the relative carbon footprint of production, raw material sourcing and the supply chain is unknown. A scientific methodology has been made to analyze how much CO2 emissions are reduced when buying used goods like secondhand hardware versus new hardware.Quality secondhand goods can be more durable than equivalent new goods."
 Risks ,,"Many items that are considered obsolete and worthless in developed countries, such as decade-old hand tools and clothes, are useful and valuable in impoverished communities in the country or in developing countries. Underdeveloped countries like Zambia are extremely welcoming to donated secondhand clothing. At a time when the country's economy was in severe decline, the used goods provided jobs by keeping ""many others busy with repairs and alterations"". It has created a type of spin-off economy at a time when many Zambians were out of work."
 Risks ,,"The used garments and materials that were donated to the country also allowed for the production of ""a wide range of fabrics"" whose imports had been previously restricted. The trade is essentially executed by women who operate their small business based on local associations and networks. Not only does this provide self-employment, but it also increases household income and enhances the economy. But while many countries would be welcoming of secondhand goods, it is also true that there are countries in need who refuse donated items."
 Risks ,,"Countries like Poland, the Philippines, and Pakistan have been known to reject secondhand items for ""fear of venereal disease and risk to personal hygiene"". Similar to these countries, India also refuses the import of secondhand clothing but will accept the import of wool fibers, including mutilated hosiery which is a term meaning ""woollen garments shredded by machine in the West prior to export""."
 Risks ,,"Through the production of shoddy (recycled wool), most of which is produced in Northern India today, unused clothing can be recycled into fibers that are spun into yarn for reuse in ""new"" used goods.There has been concern that export of electronic waste is disguised as trade of used goods, with the equipment ending in poor-country waste dumps.,"
 Types , Used clothing ,"In developed countries, unwanted used clothing is often donated to charities that sort and sell it. Some of these distribute some of the clothing to people on low incomes for free or at a very low price. Others sell all of the collected clothing in bulk to a commercial used clothing redistributor and then use the raised funds to finance their activities. In the U.S., almost 5 billion pounds of clothing is donated to charity shops each year. Only about 10% of it can be re-sold by the charity shops."
 Types , Used clothing ,"About a third of the donated clothing is bought, usually in bulk and at a heavy discount, by commercial dealers and fabric recyclers, who export it to other countries. Some of the used clothes are also smuggled into Mexico.Whereas charity shops dominated the secondhand market from the 1960s to the 1970s, more specialized, profit-oriented shops emerged in the 1980s. These shops catered primarily to the fashionable female demographic and offered women and children designer clothes, and occasionally high-end formal wear for men."
 Types , Used clothing ,"Resale boutiques specialized in contemporary high-end used designer fashion (for example, 2nd Take, or Couture Designer Resale), while others (such as Buffalo Exchange and Plato's Closet) specialize in vintage or retro fashion, period fashion, or contemporary basics and one-of-a-kind finds. Still others cater to specific active sports by specializing in things like riding equipment, diving gear, etc. The resale business model has now expanded into the athletic equipment, books, and music categories."
 Types , Used clothing ,"Secondhand sales migrated to a peer-to-peer platform—effectively cutting out the retailer as the middleman—when websites such as eBay and Amazon introduced the opportunity for Internet users to sell virtually anything online, including designer (or fraudulent) handbags, fashion, shoes, and accessories. Used clothing unsuitable for sale in an affluent market may still find a buyer or end-user in another market, such as a student market or a less affluent region of a developing country. In developing countries, such as Zambia, secondhand clothing is sorted, recycled, and sometimes redistributed to other nations."
 Types , Used clothing ,"Some of the scraps are kept and used to create unique fashions that enable the locals to construct identity. Not only does the trade represent a great source of employment for women as well as men, but it also supports other facets of the economy: the merchants buy timber and other materials for their stands, metal hangers to display clothing, and food and drinks for customers. Carriers also find work as they transport the garments from factories to various locations."
 Types , Used clothing ,"The secondhand clothing trade is central to the lives of many citizens dwelling in such countries.Importation of used clothing is sometimes opposed by the textile industry in developing countries. They are concerned that fewer people will buy the new clothes that they make when it is cheaper to buy imported used clothing. Nearly all the clothes made in Mexico are intended for export, and the Mexican textile industry opposes the importation of used clothes."
 Types , Electronics and home appliance ,"Electronics usually are traded as second hand goods, and may represent a hazard if disposed off incorrectly. Many of them may still be used, despite they are sometimes outdated ( for example TV's. While people may buy a new O-LED, and dispose off an older LCD TV, if still functional, it can be sold, not disposed off). In case of electronics, older electronics ( like home audio equipment) may outlast new equipment. It is the same for some home appliances."
 Types , Design and furniture ,"Design items and furniture are also seeing an increase in being traded as secondhand goods. With some designer items being sought after in marketplaces. When trading design furniture and items you usually must be aware of the original retail price as most of the goods, if kept well, retain their value quite well."

 Conversion of energy ,,"Machines converting energy contained in fuels to mechanical work or electric energy produce heat as a by-product. In the majority of energy applications, energy is required in multiple forms. These energy forms typically include some combination of: heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, mechanical energy and electric power. Often, these additional forms of energy are produced by a heat engine, running on a source of high-temperature heat. A heat engine can never have perfect efficiency, according to the second law of thermodynamics, therefore a heat engine will always produce a surplus of low-temperature heat."
 Conversion of energy ,,"This is commonly referred to as waste heat or ""secondary heat"", or ""low-grade heat"". This heat is useful for the majority of heating applications, however, it is sometimes not practical to transport heat energy over long distances, unlike electricity or fuel energy. The largest proportions of total waste heat are from power stations and vehicle engines. The largest single sources are power stations and industrial plants such as oil refineries and steelmaking plants."
 Sources , Air conditioning ,"Conventional air conditioning systems are a source of waste heat by releasing waste heat into the outdoor ambient air whilst cooling indoor spaces. This expelling of waste heat from air conditioning can worsen the urban heat island effect. Waste heat from air conditioning can be reduced through the use of passive cooling building design and zero-energy methods like evaporative cooling and passive daytime radiative cooling, the latter of which sends waste heat directly to outer space through the infrared window."
 Sources , Power generation ,"The electrical efficiency of thermal power plants is defined as the ratio between the input and output energy. It is typically only 33% when disregarding usefulness of the heat output for building heat. The images show cooling towers which allow power stations to maintain the low side of the temperature difference essential for conversion of heat differences to other forms of energy. Discarded or ""Waste"" heat that is lost to the environment may instead be used to advantage."
 Sources , Industrial processes ,"Industrial processes, such as oil refining, steel making or glass making are major sources of waste heat."
 Sources , Electronics ,"Although small in terms of power, the disposal of waste heat from microchips and other electronic components, represents a significant engineering challenge. This necessitates the use of fans, heatsinks, etc. to dispose of the heat. For example, data centers use electronic components that consume electricity for computing, storage and networking. The French CNRS explains a data center is like a resistor and most of the energy it consumes is transformed into heat and requires cooling systems."
 Sources , Biological ,"Humans, like all animals, produce heat as a result of metabolism. In warm conditions, this heat exceeds a level required for homeostasis in warm-blooded animals, and is disposed of by various thermoregulation methods such as sweating and panting. Fiala et al. modelled human thermoregulation. Low temperature heat contains very little capacity to do work (Exergy), so the heat is qualified as waste heat and rejected to the environment. Economically most convenient is the rejection of such heat to water from a sea, lake or river."
 Sources , Biological ,"If sufficient cooling water is not available, the plant can be equipped with a cooling tower or air cooler to reject the waste heat into the atmosphere. In some cases it is possible to use waste heat, for instance in district heating systems."
 Uses , Conversion to electricity ,"There are many different approaches to transfer thermal energy to electricity, and the technologies to do so have existed for several decades. An established approach is by using a thermoelectric device, where a change in temperature across a semiconductor material creates a voltage through a phenomenon known as the Seebeck effect. A related approach is the use of thermogalvanic cells, where a temperature difference gives rise to an electric current in an electrochemical cell.The organic Rankine cycle, offered by companies such as Ormat, is a very known approach, whereby an organic substance is used as working medium instead of water."
 Uses , Conversion to electricity ,The benefit is that this process can reject heat at lower temperatures for the production of electricity than the regular water steam cycle. An example of use of the steam Rankine cycle is the Cyclone Waste Heat Engine.
 Uses , Cogeneration and trigeneration ,"Waste of the by-product heat is reduced if a cogeneration system is used, also known as a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system. Limitations to the use of by-product heat arise primarily from the engineering cost/efficiency challenges in effectively exploiting small temperature differences to generate other forms of energy. Applications utilizing waste heat include swimming pool heating and paper mills. In some cases, cooling can also be produced by the use of absorption refrigerators for example, in this case it's called trigeneration or CCHP (combined cooling, heat and power)."
 Uses , District heating ,"Waste heat can be used in district heating. Depending on the temperature of the waste heat and the district heating system, a heat pump must be used, to reach sufficient temperatures. An easy and cheap way to use waste heat in cold district heating systems, as these are operated at ambient temperatures and therefore even low-grade waste heat can be used without needing a heat pump at the producer side."
 Uses , Pre-heating ,"Waste heat can be forced to heat incoming fluids and objects before being highly heated. For instance outgoing water can give its waste heat to incoming water in a heat exchanger before heating in homes or power plants. Anthropogenic heat is heat generated by humans and human activity. The American Meteorological Society defines it as ""Heat released to the atmosphere as a result of human activities, often involving combustion of fuels. Sources include industrial plants, space heating and cooling, human metabolism, and vehicle exhausts."
 Uses , Pre-heating ,"In cities this source typically contributes 15–50 W/m2 to the local heat balance, and several hundred W/m2 in the center of large cities in cold climates and industrial areas."" In 2020, the overall anthropogenic annual energy release was 168,000 terawatt-hours; given the 5.1×1014 m2 surface area of Earth, this amounts to a global average anthropogenic heat release rate of 0.04 W/m2."
 Anthropogenic heat , Environmental impact ,"Anthropogenic heat is a small influence on rural temperatures, and becomes more significant in dense urban areas. It is one contributor to urban heat islands. Other human-caused effects (such as changes to albedo, or loss of evaporative cooling) that might contribute to urban heat islands are not considered to be anthropogenic heat by this definition. Anthropogenic heat is a much smaller contributor to global warming than greenhouse gases are. In 2005, anthropogenic waste heat flux globally accounted for only 1% of the energy flux created by anthropogenic greenhouse gases."
 Anthropogenic heat , Environmental impact ,"The heat flux is not evenly distributed, with some regions higher than others, and significantly higher in certain urban areas. For example, global forcing from waste heat in 2005 was 0.028 W/m2, but was +0.39 and +0.68 W/m2 for the continental United States and western Europe, respectively.Although waste heat has been shown to have influence on regional climates, climate forcing from waste heat is not normally calculated in state-of-the-art global climate simulations. Equilibrium climate experiments show statistically significant continental-scale surface warming (0.4–0.9 °C) produced by one 2100 AHF scenario, but not by current or 2040 estimates."
 Anthropogenic heat , Environmental impact ,"Simple global-scale estimates with different growth rates of anthropogenic heat that have been actualized recently show noticeable contributions to global warming, in the following centuries. For example, a 2% p.a. growth rate of waste heat resulted in a 3 degree increase as a lower limit for the year 2300. Meanwhile, this has been confirmed by more refined model calculations.A 2008 scientific paper showed that if anthropogenic heat emissions continue to rise at the current rate, they will become a source of warming as strong as GHG emissions in the 21st century."

 Types ,,"Ethylene spent caustic comes from the caustic scrubbing of cracked gas from an ethylene cracker. This liquor is produced by a caustic scrubbing tower. Ethylene product gas is contaminated with H2S(g) and CO2(g), and those contaminants are removed by absorption in the caustic scrubbing tower to produce NaHS(aq) and Na2CO3(aq). The sodium hydroxide is consumed and the resulting wastewater (ethylene spent caustic) is contaminated with the sulfides and carbonates and a small fraction of organic compounds. Refinery spent caustic comes from multiple sources: the Merox processing of gasoline; the Merox processing of kerosene/jet fuel; and the caustic scrubbing/Merox processing of LPG."
 Types ,,"In these streams sulfides and organic acids are removed from the product streams into the caustic phase. The sodium hydroxide is consumed and the resulting wastewaters (cresylic for gasoline; naphthenic for kerosene/jet fuel; sulfidic for LPG -spent caustics) are often mixed and called refinery spent caustic. This spent caustic is contaminated with sulfides, carbonates, and in many cases a high fraction of organic acids. Spent caustics are malodorous wastewaters that are difficult to treat in conventional wastewater processes."
 Types ,,"Typically the material is disposed of by high dilution with biotreatment, deep well injection, incineration, wet air oxidation, Humid Peroxide Oxidation or other speciality processes.

 Sources ,,"The supply of waste silk is drawn from the following sources: The silkworm, when commencing to spin, emits a dull, lustreless and uneven thread with which it suspends itself from the twigs and leaves of the tree upon which it has been feeding, or the straws provided for it by attendants in the worm-rearing establishments: this first thread is unreelable, and, moreover, is often mixed with straw, leaves and twigs."
 Sources ,,"The outside layers of the true cocoon are too coarse and uneven for reeling; and as the worm completes its task of spinning, the thread becomes finer and weaker, so both the extreme outside and inside layers are put aside as waste. Pierced cocoons, that is, those from which the moth of the silkworm has emerged-and damaged cocoons. During the process of reeling from the cocoon the silk often breaks; and both in finding a true and reliable thread, and in joining the ends, there is unavoidable waste."
 Sources ,,"Raw silk skeins are often re-reeled; and in this process part has to be discarded: this being known to the trade as gum-waste. The same term—gum-waste—is applied to ""waste"" made in the various processes of silk throwing; but manufacturers using threads known technically as organzines and trams call the surplus ""manufacturer's waste."" A silk ""throwster"" receives the silk in skein form, the thread of which consists of a number of silk fibres wound together to make a certain diameter or size, the separate fibre having actually been spun by the worm."
 Sources ,,"The silk-waste spinner receives the silk in quite a different form: merely the raw material, packed in bales of various sizes and weights, the contents being a much-tangled mass of all lengths of fibre mixed with much foreign matter, such as ends of straws, twigs, leaves, worms and chrysalis. It is the spinner's business to straighten out these fibres, with the aid of machinery, and then to so join them that they become a thread, which is known as spun silk."
 Sources ,,"All silk produced by the worm is composed of two substances: fibroin, the true thread, and sericin, which is a hard, gummy coating of the fibroin. Before the silk can be manipulated by machinery to any advantage, the gum coating must be removed by dissolving and washing it away. Where the method used in achieving this operation is through fermentation, the product is called schappe."
 Sources ,,"The former, schapping, is the French, Italian and Swiss method, from which the silk when finished is neither so bright nor so good in colour as the discharged silk; but it is very clean and level, and for some purposes essential, as, for instance, in velvet manufacture.

 Background ,,"According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), defined containers and packaging as products that are assumed to be discarded the same year the products they contain are purchased. The majority of the solid waste are packaging products, estimating to be about 77.9 million tons of generation in 2015 (29.7 percent of total generation). Packaging can come in all shapes and forms ranging from Amazon boxes to soda cans and are used to store, transport, contain, and protect goods to keep customer satisfaction. The type of packaging materials including glass, aluminum, steel, paper, cardboard, plastic, wood, and other miscellaneous packaging."
 Background ,,"Packaging waste is a dominant contributor in today's world and responsible for half of the waste in the globe.The recycling rate in 2015 for containers and packaging was 53 percent. Furthermore, the process of burning of containers and packaging was 7.2 million tons (21.4 percent of total combustion with energy recovery). Following the landfills that received 29.4 million tons (21.4 percent of total land filling) within the same year.As packaging waste pollutes the Earth, all life on Earth experiences negative impacts that affected their lifestyle. Marine or land-living animals are suffocating due to the pollution of packaging waste."
 Background ,,"This is a major issue for low income countries who do not have an efficient waste management system to clean up their environments and being the main sources for the global ocean pollution. But 'litter louts', individuals who lack the motivation to recycle and instead leave their waste anywhere they want are also major contributors, especially in high income nations where such facilities are available. The current location with the greatest amount of solid waste that includes most of packaging products is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch located at West Coast of North America to Japan."
 Background ,,"Most packaging waste that eventually goes into the ocean often comes from places such as lakes, streams, and sewage. Possible solutions to reducing packaging waste are very simple and easy and could start with minimisation of packaging material ranging up to a zero waste strategy (package-free products). The problem is mainly in a lack of motivation to start making a change. But examples of effective ways to help reduce packaging pollution include banning the use of single-use plastics, more social awareness and education, promotion of eco-friendly alternatives, public pressure, voluntary cleaning up, and adopting reusable or biodegradable bags."
 Background ,,"The Institute of Packaging Professionals defines overpackaging as ""a condition where the methods and materials used to package an item exceed the requirements for adequate containment, protection, transport, and sale."" Overpackaging is an opportunity for source reduction, reducing waste by proper package design and practice. A classic example of a wasteful package design is a breakfast cereal box. This is typically a folding carton enclosing a plastic bag of cereal. Cartons are typically tall and wide but very thin. This has an inefficient material-to-volume ratio; it is wasteful."
 Background ,,"Structural packaging engineers are aware of the opportunity to save packaging costs, materials, and waste but marketers find benefit in a ""billboard"" style package for advertising and graphics. An optimized folding box would use much less paperboard for the same volume of cereal, but with reduced surface area for graphics. The use of a plastic bag without an enclosing box would use less material per unit of cereal.Slackfill packaging is that which is intentionally under-filled, resulting in non-functional headspace."
 Background ,,"Packagers doing this not only risk charges of deceptive packaging but are using excessive packaging: packaging waste.With fragile items such as consumer electronics, engineers try to match the fragility of the product with the expected stresses of distribution handling. Package cushioning is used to help ensure safe delivery of the product. With overpackaging, excessive cushion and a larger corrugated box are used: wasteful packaging. Conversely, underpackaging would be the use of insufficient cushioning. Excessive product waste caused by underpackaging may be worse for the environment than the waste of the package."
 Background ,,"Sometimes packaging is designed to protect its product for controlled distribution to a retail store. With online shopping or E-commerce, however, items packed for retail sale may be shipped individually by Fulfillment houses by package delivery or small parcel carriers. Retail packages are frequently packed into a larger corrugated box for shipment. Often these secondary boxes are much larger than needed, thus use void-fill to immobilize the contents. This can have the appearance of gross overpackaging but is sometimes necessary."
 Background ,,"If the product packager designed all packaging to meet the requirements of individual shipment, then the portion delivered to a retail store would have excessive packaging. Sometimes two levels of packaging are needed for separate distribution, resulting in production inefficiencies."
 Types of packaging wastes , Glass containers ,"Bottles and jars for drinks and storing foods or juices are examples of glass containers. It's been estimated by the EPA that 9.1 million tons of glass containers were generated in 2015, or 3.5 percent of municipal solid waste (MSW). About 70 percent of glass consumption is used for containers and packaging purposes. At least 13.2 percent of the production of glass and containers are burned with energy recovery. The amount of glass containers and packaging going into the land fill is about 53 percent."
 Types of packaging wastes , Aluminum containers and packaging ,"Aluminum container and packaging waste usually comes from cans from any kind of beverages, but foil can also be another that contributes it as well. It's been given that about 25 percent of aluminum is used for packaging purposes. Using the Aluminum Association Data, it has been calculated that at least 1.8 million tons of aluminum packaging were generated in 2015 or 0.8 percent MSW produced. Of those that are produced, only about 670,000 tons of aluminum containers and packaging were recycled, about 54.9 percent. And, the ones that ends up in the land fill is 50.6 percent."
 Types of packaging wastes , Steel containers and packaging ,"The production of steel containers and packaging mostly comes in cans and other things like steel barrels. Only about 5 percent of steel use for packaging purposes of the total world of steel consumption which makes it the least amount wasted and the most recycled. It's totaled that 2.2 million tons or 0.9 percent of MSW generated in 2015. While according to the Steel Recycling Institute, an estimate of 1.6 million tons (73 percent) of steel packaging were recycled. Adding on, the steel packaging that were combusted with energy recover was about 5.4 percent and 21.6 percent were land filled."
 Types of packaging wastes , Paper and paperboard containers and packaging ,"The most of it being generated, and within the MSW in 2015, was corrugated boxes coming with at least 31.3 million tons (11.3 percent total) produced. However, it also the top most recycled at 28.9 million tons (92.3 percent) boxes being recycled in 2015.Later on, they are then combusted which makes 0.5 million tons and landfills received 1.9 million tons. Other than corrugated boxes, cartons, bags, sacks, wrapping papers, and other boxes used for shoes or cosmetics are other examples of paper and paperboard containers and packaging."
 Types of packaging wastes , Paper and paperboard containers and packaging ,"The total amount of MSW generated for paper and paperboard containers and packaging was 39.9 million tons or 15.1 percent in 2015. Although, the recycled rate is about 78.2 percent and 4.3 percent of small proportions were combusted with energy recovery and 17.6 percent in landfill."
 Types of packaging wastes , Wood packaging ,"Wood packaging is anything that is made out of wood used for packaging purposes (e.g., wood crates, wood chips, boards, and planks). Wood packaging is still highly used in today's world for transporting goods. According to EPA's data that were borrowed from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and the United States Department of Agriculture's Forest Service Southern Research Station, 9.8 million tons (3.7 percent of total MSW) of wood packaging were made in production in 2015. Also, in 2015, the amount that was recycled 2.7 million tons."
 Types of packaging wastes , Wood packaging ,"Moreover, its estimated that 14.3 percent of the wood containers and packaging waste generated was combusted with energy recovery, while the 58.6 percent went to the land filled."
 Types of packaging wastes , Plastic containers and packaging ,"Plastic containers and packaging can be found in plastic bottles, supermarket bags, milk and water jugs, and more. EPA used data from the American Chemistry Council to estimate that 14.7 million tons (5.5 percent of MSW generation) of plastic containers and packaging were created in 2015. The overall amount that is recycled is about 2.2 million tons (14.6 percent). In addition, 16.8 percent were combusted with energy recover and 68.6 percent went straight into the land fill."
 Types of packaging wastes , Plastic containers and packaging ,"Most of the plastics are made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP) and other resins. That being said, the recycling rate for PET bottles and jars was 29.9 percent (890,000 tons) and the recycling of HDPE water and milk jugs was 30.3 percent (230,000 tons)."
 Role of packaging waste in pollution , Litter ,"Litter mostly consists of packaging waste. Besides the disfigurement of the landscape, it also poses a health hazard for various life forms. Packaging materials such as glass and plastic bottles are the main constituents of litter. It has a huge impact on the marine environment as well, when animals are caught in or accidentally consume plastic packaging."
 Role of packaging waste in pollution , Air pollution ,"The production of packaging material is the main source of the air pollution that is being spread globally. Some emissions comes from accidental fires or activities that includes incineration of packaging waste that releases vinyl chloride, CFC, and hexane. For a more direct course, emissions can originate in land fill sites which could release CO2 and methane. Most CO2 comes from steel and glass packaging manufacturing."
 Role of packaging waste in pollution , Water pollution ,"Packaging waste can come from land based or marine sources. The current location that makes up the large of amount of water pollution is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch located at West Coast of North America to Japan. Marine sources such as rivers that caught packaging materials eventually lead to the oceans. In global standards, about 80 percent of packaging waste in ocean comes from land based sources and 20 percent comes from marine sources."
 Role of packaging waste in pollution , Water pollution ,"The 20 percent of packaging waste that comes from marine sources comes from the rivers of China starting from least to greatest contributors, the Hanjiang, Zhujiang, Dong, Huangpu, Xi, and Yangtze river. All other marine sources comes from rivers of Africa and Southeast Asia. Most marine species and wildlife species suffer from the following: Entanglement: At least 344 species are entangled by packaging waste, specifically the ones that are plastics. Most of the victims are marine species like whales, seabirds, turtles, and fish. Ingestion: 233 marine species are recorded that had consumed plastic packaging waste of either unintentionally, intentionally, or indirectly."
 Role of packaging waste in pollution , Water pollution ,"Again, the following victims would be whales, fish, mammals, seabirds, and turtles. The effects of eating plastic packaging waste could lead to greatly reduced stomach capacity, leading to poor appetite and false sense of satiation. Whats worse is that the size of the ingested material is ultimately limited by the size of the organism. For example, microplastics consumed by planktons and fishes can consume cigarettes boxes. Plastic can also obstruct or perforate the gut, cause ulcerative lesions, or gastric rupture. This can ultimately lead to death. Interaction: Animals contacting with packaging waste includes collisions, obstructions, abrasions or use as substrate."
 Role of packaging waste in pollution , Water pollution ,"Bisphenol A (BPA), styrene and benzene can be found in certain packaging waste. BPA can affect the hearts of women, permanently damage the DNA of mice, and appear to be entering the human body from a variety of unknown sources. Studies from Journal of American Association shows that higher bisphenol A levels were significantly associated with heart diseases, diabetes, and abnormally high levels of certain liver enzymes. Toxins such as these are found within our food chains. When fish or plankton consume microplastics, it can also enter our food chain."
 Role of packaging waste in pollution , Water pollution ,"Microplastics was also found in common table salt and in both tap and bottled water. Microplastics are dangerous as the toxins can affect the human body's nervous, respiratory, and reproductive system."
 Actions to reduce packaging wastes , Waste management system improvements ,"Segregation of waste at sources: plastics, organic, metals, paper, etc. Effective collection of the segregated waste, transport and safe storage Cost-effective recycling of materials (including plastics) Less land filling and dumping in the environment"
 Actions to reduce packaging wastes , Promotion of eco-friendly alternatives ,"Governments working with industries could support the development and promotion of sustainable alternatives in order to phase out single-use plastics progressively. If governments were to introduce economic incentives, supporting projects which upscale or recycle single-use items and stimulating the creation of micro-enterprises, they could contribute to the uptake of eco-friendly alternatives to single-use plastics."
 Actions to reduce packaging wastes , Social awareness and education ,"Social awareness and education is also one of the ways to help contribute to issues similar to helping reducing packaging waste. Using the media gives quick access for the individuals or groups to spread information and awareness in regarding to letting the public know what is going on in the world and ways that others can contribute to assist in fixing problems of packaging wastes. Schools are also good for spreading the education with factual knowledge, possible outcomes for the increase of packaging waste, and provide ways to get individuals to give a helping hand in keeping our planet clean."
 Actions to reduce packaging wastes , Social awareness and education ,"Public awareness strategies can include a wide range of activities designed to persuade and educate. These strategies may focus not only on the reuse and recycling of resources, but also on encouraging responsible use and minimization of waste generation and litter."

 Background , Food Waste in China ,"The 2018 WWF report on food waste in Chinese cities shows that a total of 17-18 million ton food is wasted annually in Chinese cities. On average, each citizen wastes 93 grams of food per meal in the cities surveyed (Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and Lhasa), in which vegetable and staple food constitute the majority of the waste. Quantity of food waste is found to be associated with a variety of factors: restaurant size, purpose of the meal, etc."
 Background , Food Waste in China ,"On average, tourists waste more food than local citizens; larger restaurants have more serious food waste than smaller ones; friend-gathering and business-purposed meals contribute to higher food waste, too. The study also finds the food waste in primary and secondary schools to be above average, potentially due to low satisfaction with the quality of school dining.Consumer food waste in China takes up a significant portion in the country's total food waste. An estimated of 50 Mt of grain in China is annually wasted at the consumer stage, compared to 35 Mt at pre-consumer stages."
 Background , Food Waste in China ,"90% of consumer-stage food waste happens in mid to high-end restaurants and canteens in China, whereas in western countries such as the European Union, household food waste plays the biggest role (42%, 38 Mt), and food service sector trails behind at 14%. Alternative sources estimate the annual consumer food waste in China to be about 17-18 Mt in 2015, equivalent to the annual consumption of 30-50 million people."
 Background , Consumer Culture and Behavior ,"In special occasion dinner, consumer culture plays a big role in producing more food waste. As a matter of etiquette, costumers tend to order more than they can consume. The abundance of beverages in these dinners would also reduce food intake, increasing the quantity of food waste. In China, the use of an ""doggy bag"" is not only traditionally frowned upon as a sign of poor financial status, but also economically discouraged as most restaurants charge the customers for the doggy bags."
 Background , Consumer Culture and Behavior ,"This factor is found to reduce consumers' willingness of packing leftover food, along with the poor environmental soundness of the doggy bags themselves.The consumer dietary knowledge and preferences also contributes to food waste significantly. Risk-averting consumers would consciously throw away seemly fresh food earlier; Urban consumers with access to more various and well-processed food options would waste less than rural consumers in household food production. In China, researchers find an intriguing relation between dietary knowledge and household food waste."
 Background , Consumer Culture and Behavior ,"Rural and low-income consumer's dietary knowledge is found to increases the quantity of food waste more substantially than that of the urban consumers. Conversely, more dietary knowledge in high-income households and communities with higher development index decreases the quantity of food waste, presumably through education on dietary knowledge."
 Background , Climate Change and Food Security ,"The climate crisis profoundly challenges the world's food supply, particularly in less-developed regions. Climate change affects the environmental conditions for agricultural production by heating up average temperature, altering precipitation patterns, and induce more extreme climate events. This is an accelerating process as the climate crisis continues to unfold in the near future, threatening global crop production and putting an additional 1-183 million people in food insecurity."
 Background , Climate Change and Food Security ,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identifies low-income consumers to be the most affected, especially women, who have been more involved in the food source of households.Decreasing food loss and waste could help with both emission reduction and food security. IPCC estimates 25-30% food to be wasted in production and consumption globally, which, during 2010–2016, equates to 8-10% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions."
 Background , Climate Change and Food Security ,"Therefore, managing food waste becomes a significant mitigation measure in the agriculture sector.In 2020, Chinese food security is under pressure due to the joint effect of long-term factors such as climate anomalies and decrease of rural labor, as well as short-term emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic and African swine fever. A rare typhoon struck the country's main corn production area in the northeast before the autumn harvest, resulting in production decrease and price surge of the main source of grain in China, alongside summer floods earlier in the year."
 Background , Climate Change and Food Security ,"On the meat market, the 2019-2020 African swine fever outbreak had already increased the price of pork, the most consumed meat in China, by 135.2% in February, only to drop in October after 19 months of increase. The COVID-19 pandemic forced many countries to tighten export control of grains, decreasing China's crop import and putting pressure on the country's ability to self-sustain. The pressing situation is cited by CCP general secretary Xi Jinping and official Chinese media, as well as other press sources, as a motivation for the second round of Clean Plate campaign in 2020."
 History , 2013 ,"Clean Plate Campaign is a movement initiated in January 2013 by a public-spirited group IN_33 with its members from various industries appeal to the public of eating up everything from one's plate aiming to reduce food waste and ensure food security in China. This group handed out hundreds and thousands of flyers and posters in Beijing. It reached out to many restaurants to help them advertise the concept of ""clean plate"" through posters and flyers. It also uses the online platform to encourage people not to waste food."
 History , 2013 ,"Their posting of pictures of clean plates at meals stirred up a trend for lots of netizens to follow. On Weibo, the social media platform of the original post, there are over 50 million retweets within days.Soon, this campaign became widely known and reached the government. Starting on January 23, one of the largest news industry in China People's Daily published several favorable editorial on the Clean Plate campaign and encourage more people to follow its cause."
 History , 2013 ,"Because People's Daily is an official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and is known for being the direct channel voicing the Chinese Communist Party's policy platforms and viewpoints. On January 28, Chinese leader Xi Jinping gave instructions on food waste in a report from Xinhua News Agency, which is the official state-run press agency of the People's Republic of China. He stated that the food waste in China is astonishing. Considering some Chinese people still live under the poverty line, we must strike down the waste and restore the frugal tradition of the Chinese civilization."
 History , 2013 ,"He also urged the relevant authority to take actions, and public officials to be the model for reducing waste.The quick response from the government demonstrates the state's long term concern of food security and also the campaign fighting for corruption. In Communist Party leader Xi Jinping's instruction, he clearly stated the emphasis to eliminate lavish banquets held at the government expenses, which is one important criteria of his anti-corruption campaign since he took office in 2012."
 History , 2013 ,"Along with the Eight-point Regulation stipulated in December 2012, which also included clauses of limiting the resources and consumption for government officials using government funds, there has been great improvement in food waste in the government sector. However, although there are private actions like promoting ""half-size dishes"", advocating for ""to-go box"", rewarding customers for finishing all food and has produced some results locally, the government mostly stayed out of the campaign on regulating food waste in the private realm."
 History , 2017 ,"Four years later in 2017, after the high tides of popularity faded and the society resumed to normality, the impact of the Clean Plate campaign could be viewed more objectively. The chairman of the executive board of Goubuli, one of the most famous stuffed baozi restaurants told the reporter that there are much less government branches holding banquets in restaurants using the government funding. Most orders taken now are from private families. Another major improvement made is in the education sector. The clean plate campaign has been applauded in many primary and secondary education institutions."
 History , 2017 ,"The lessons and programs educating students not to waste food, with school teachers taking the initiative as good examples continue to be an integrated part of school disciplinary and advocacy even four years after.However, in many other sectors, the trend of food waste is back. In Wuhan, many restaurants broke their promises on responding to the call of clean plate campaign four years later. Popular ""half-sized dishes"" were no longer provided in many restaurants. Another example to support this push-back of food waste is on processing Biodegradable waste."
 History , 2017 ,"The experience of one Tianjin company on processing Biodegradable waste told reporters that the amount of such waste had a huge decline in the beginning of the clean plate campaign in 2013. However, the waste has kept climbing in the following years, indicating that the remaining impact of the clean plate campaign is very minimal four years after it started."
 History , 2020 ,"The new round of ""Clean Plate Campaign"" started on August 11, 2020, when CCP general secretary Xi Jinping made a public speech saying that ""Waste is shameful and thriftiness is honorable"", criticizing the level of food waste in the country being as ""shocking and distressing"". He stressed the importance of maintaining a sense of crisis, especially as the COVID-19 has ""sounded alarm"". However, his directives did not specify detailed actions to solve the problem, leaving local officials and businesses a large space to come up with a large range of methods."
 History , 2020 ,"In some places, the government's effort on reducing food waste is restricted on publicity. In Chongqing, the Federation of Industry and Commerce introduced LED screens displaying ""establish a frugal consumption reminder system"". However, it seems to produce little results as Chongqing Daily investigated several restaurants and concluded that food waste is still common.Some local governments went through more details in giving instructions and setting up systems."
 History , 2020 ,"The city of Beijing in September published ""The Guideline of stopping food waste and implementing Clean Plate"", instructing 9 different dining places, like different dining halls, restaurants and hotels on issues that happened in the entire food making chain. It means to reduce both food waste and kitchen waste in every step of processing, producing, consuming and disposing. The Wuhan Catering Industry Association proposed a system called ""N-1 ordering"", meaning that each group could order no more than one dish lower than the number of the diners."
 History , 2020 ,"Soon, Xianning and Xinyang, in Hubei and Henan province respectively followed the example of Wuhan and made the same proposal. However, this suggestion encountered some suspicions and concerns, as some believed it is too rigid by harming small dining groups and limiting people's food choices. It is also considered to harm the interests of the catering industry and individual restaurants because no restaurant wants to limit customers from ordering more food. But there are methods used that are arbitrary and brutal."
 History , 2020 ,"One restaurant in Changsha, Hunan went as far as demanding its customers to weigh themselves before entering to help them decide the meal size. It soon received harsh criticism and pushback from people, pushing it to apologize to the public.The central government also started to work on solid solutions towards reducing food waste. Starting in September 2020, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress initiated a month-long investigation on food security and waste, aiming to expedite the legislative mechanism in establishing the basic code of conduct on catering and daily grocery consumption for the whole society."
 History , 2020 ,"On December 22, the draft of the law of anti-food waste was first deliberated during the twenty-fourth meeting on the Standing Committee of the Thirteenth National People's Congress. The legislation was passed on April 29, 2021, through the Standing Committee of the Thirteenth National People's Congress. The law of Anti-food waste is the latest and most solid government effort battling food waste since the authority announced for the new round of ""clean plate campaign"" in August 2020."
 History , 2020 ,"The rapid spread of the Clean Plate campaign across the country in months is regarded by many as an interesting case study into the online activism and mass media in China on the edge of transitioning into the age of mobile internet and new media, with a few key turning points identified as crucial for its mass spread: alignment with government agenda, official endorsement."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Mass Media , Alignment with Government Agenda ,"The Clean Plate campaign, compared to other ""mass incidents"" in China, is less controversial and sensitive, and aligns with the anti-corruption campaign of Xi Jinping, the new paramount leader of China at the time. While other civil anti-corruption campaigns, such as those calling for the release of the personal assets of officials, are mostly ignored, the Clean Plate campaign came out on top to receive official endorsement and the subsequent coverage."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Mass Media , Official endorsement ,"Official coverage of the event helped the campaign go out of Beijing and rapidly spread on Weibo and other cities across China. Xu Zhijun, one of the initiators of the campaign, has been making posts on Weibo against food waste for a long time, who initially felt the campaign would die out like other similar ones on Weibo. The scope of IN_33's activity was also small scale in the beginning, confined to Beijing city where volunteers personally deliver posters to local restaurants."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Mass Media , Official endorsement ,"But the turning point came as Xi made a comment on the Clean Plate campaign, calling for a stop on ""wasteful habits"", after which the official medias such as the People's Daily and Guangming Daily made a quick move to cover the campaign, making a further connection to Xi's anti-corruption campaign to cease lavish meals hosted by the officials. People's Daily, with nearly four million followers on Weibo, posted its first message about the Clean Plate campaign on 22 January: ""I take pride in cleaning my plate"", ""say no to waste and save the grains."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Mass Media , Official endorsement ,"Don't leave food behind, use a doggy bag, and start from myself."" Two-million-follower China Central Television (CCTV) made a call for the campaign as well."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Mass Media , Official endorsement ,"The People's Daily reported the forwarding count on Weibo to reach fifty million just two days later, in which the paper released an analysis on online public opinion and found that while 44% netizens incline towards the spirit of the original campaign, or ""clean plate starting from myself"", 20% argues that the fundamental is to raise income level and bridge the income gap, and 25% of the opinions believe that the lavish banquets of officials is a more urgent issue than ""Clean Plate"" (1). Many other official media commented on the connection between Clean Plate and Xi's campaign, too."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Mass Media , Official endorsement ,"Xinhua News Agency, mouthpiece of the State Council, spoke critically of the ""extravagant incident in the Party and in politics"" which is ""despised yet resistant"". Guangming Daily, another official newspaper of the CCP, commented that the civil service should set an example in carrying out the Clean Plate campaign and make it part of the clean governance. Food is the basics and the fundamentals of a person's survival and is the key to a country's stability. Thus food, especially the main grains, are considered the national strategic products. Food security is also often linked to national security."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Mass Media , Official endorsement ,"Many countries although engaged in global free trade are also reserved on trading staple crops unrestricted. Agricultural subsidies, food price control and high trade barriers while exporting/importing are all around the world. China also highly values the strategic position of food. During a visit to the country's largest soybean producer in Heilongjiang province in 2018, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said ""the rice bowl of the Chinese people, in any situation, must be firmly held in our own hands.""Food security is one top reason making the government of China restarted the ""Clean Plate Campaign""."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Mass Media , Official endorsement ,"Different from 2013, this time, the movement is mainly driven by the state with the top-down approach. The background of this round of the campaign roots deeply in the food security concerns made especially serious because of natural disasters, the pandemics and international trade tensions. These three aspects explain the rationale of the Chinese state calling to reduce waste as one step, to lower the food demand, and thus to lower the food price, solve the problem of supply shortage and ensure the food security for the mass."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , Natural Disasters ,"In 2020, a flood found to be the severest in over twenty years in China destroyed thousands of acres of farmland along the Yangtze River, damaging the most abundant and resourceful areas for rice production. By mid-July, Shenwan Hongyuan—a Chinese brokerage firm estimated the loss of Chinese rice production is roughly 5% compared to last year. The traditional Chinese diet has a north–south divide with southerners eating rice and northerners eating wheat as the main staple crop. However, the wheat harvest in 2020 was also not promising."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , Natural Disasters ,"In an announcement issued on August 5, China's National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration found that the wheat harvest is nearly 1000 tons lower than the 2019 level. Although the relative shortage is not serious enough to starve millions of people, lower supply with the unchanged demand means higher price. China's National Bureau of Statistics states a 10% price increase in July compared to a year ago. Because people substitute their crop consumption due to the bad harvest of rice and wheat, corn and soybean have also been more expensive."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , Natural Disasters ,"There is an estimate of 20% price increase in corn and 30% price increase in soybean compared to 2019. In response to the short of supply and price increase, the government released 62.5 million tons of rice, 50 million tons of corn and over 760,000 tons of soybeans by the end of July to stabilize the food market. To put that into context, this amount from Beijing's strategic reserves is nearly double the volume released during the whole of 2019."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , Natural Disasters ,"Within the same year, there was also a summer drought in the north, unprecedented typhoons in the northeast and a pest outbreak in the southwest. Such harsh climate conditions made not only farming but also the whole domestic supply chain very difficult, for example, transportation."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , Pandemics ,"A rampant African swine fever in 2019-20 seriously damaged the pork production in China, raising the pork price in many places doubled for almost a year. Pork is the dominant meat consumption in China, and as a result weighs heavily on its Consumer Price Index (CPI). Result shows that at the end of 2020, China's pork price jumps 110.2% from a year earlier, making the CPI rose for 4.5% compared to the data in the previous year, which is the highest increase of this inflation measurement in eight years.Undoubtedly, one remark of 2020 is the outbreak of COVID-19."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , Pandemics ,"""Strict lockdown measures in the early part of 2020 also cast a psychological shadow over many Chinese farmers, who began to stockpile more crops at home and were more reluctant to sell to wholesalers, out of concern that there would be a resurgence of the coronavirus."" Such behaviors reduced the supply of crops in the market which further drives up the price. Due to the pandemic, many people, especially under-protected marginalized populations have been already deprived of the deadly economic environment."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , Pandemics ,"They, who might not have even earned a penny in the situation, were very vulnerable to such a price increase of staple food and pork as mentioned above. Another aspect affecting food supply and price is the rage purchasing or food stocking. Study in April 2020 shows that 79% of respondents to the survey have stocked up dry food items like rice, noodles, flours etc. during the coronavirus outbreak. Fearing the second wave of the pandemic, there requires a higher stocks of food than usual."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , Pandemics ,"The basic economic theory tells us that higher demand usually leads to a higher price, which adds more pressure to the middle-lower class in China on their food security."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , International trade tensions ,"COVID-19 also makes international trade really hard, making foreign food supply to China really unstable. Policy-wise, many countries, including Russia, Ukraine and Vietnam, imposed strong restrictions on food exports.""They have advised us to increase stocks, keep supplies higher than we usually have. Things are not looking good in Brazil,"" a senior trader at one of China's leading food processors shows concerns over China's main supplier of soybeans and a key meat exporter where the coronavirus infections has exceeded the number in Spain and Italy in May.As a result, China resorted to the U.S. for soybean and meat supplies."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , International trade tensions ,"This is also partially due to the bilateral agreements signed to end the U.S.- China trade war, in which China promised to increase its purchase of American agricultural products, especially soybeans. However, the shadow of trade tensions adds anxiety and uncertainty to the Chinese government especially at the height of a global crisis. Such perceived over-reliance on importing food from the U.S. is politically and strategically unpopular to the Chinese government. There is a clear example showing the state's attitude towards this. The central committee of China in the next five years specified to prioritize national food security."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , International trade tensions ,"It means to reduce China's reliance on agriculture imports from countries such as the U.S. and Australia, with whom Beijing's relations have become tense. This is a dilemma to the Chinese government and really makes food security a national security issue practically. Food waste prevails in the society in recent years. It has to do with various reasons, including increasing agricultural productivity and yield, increasing food availability and choices, cultural tradition of lavish banquets, and food marketing. It could also be relevant to past experience of serious food shortages and famines."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , International trade tensions ,"Such experiences have resulted in some social behaviors like food waste especially in Buffet and hoarding supplies when any incidents or even rumors appear. Those have a negative impact on food security with uneven food distribution between urban and rural, coastal areas and massive inland. It also increases the risks of price inflation and occasional shortage when people overreact towards the food market. This problems has been increasingly alarming to the Chinese government because such waste, which undermines food security has been one of the top concerns of the Chinese society."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , International trade tensions ,"It is also the basis and key to the country's independent sovereignty, stability and prosperity. With a mass population of farmers and tradition of agriculture, food and planting is a strong cultural symbol throughout Chinese history. But feeding a population of hundreds of millions of people is never easy. Famines happened many times, even after the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. To the older Chinese population, the feeling and memory of hunger is still fresh, which dictates their dining habits. Some would keep on a frugal living because that is what they have been used to."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , International trade tensions ,"But some would have ""revenge spending"" on food. ""If there's something left in the plates, they have their face. They have a sense of security. If you have more than you actually need, it's something to be proud of."" Zhang Ye, one campaigner of the movement explains the rationale of food wasting in relation with famines in the past. Although Chinese government subsidizes farming and purposefully controls the price of main grains and groceries, there are still many challenges."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Security , International trade tensions ,"A report by the Chinese Academy of Science found that in 2015 residents in big cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, wasted 17 to 18 million tons of food, or enough to feed 30 to 50 million people. A quarter of the waste was staple foods like rice and noodles, and about 18% of its meat, the report said. With this level of waste, the Chinese government has paid close attention to the problem and responded quickly with big social events that advocated or encouraged food wastes."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Waste , Eating livestreams ,"As a result of the seriousness of food waste, some new major incidents and trends of social behaviors in resulting food waste become the targets for the government to crackdown. For example, ""eating livestreams"", or mukbang, originated in South Korea in 2010 has become very popular in China. To some, watching people eating piles of food in front of them is appealing and satisfying. This market demand attracts a lot of people entering the field. However, one often needs to really stand out in this competitive market to gain subscribers, fame and money."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Waste , Eating livestreams ,"So many of them adopt a similar practice of eating contestants in speed eating (or competitive eating). They consume a lot more food than what a normal person could eat, like 10 bowls of noodles, 20 hamburgers a meal. But because most of the people uploading their eating videos can't really eat that much foot in a short period of time, instead of real speed eating, what really happened behind many of those videos is that they will purposefully vomit what they have eaten to take in more food."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Waste , Eating livestreams ,"It happens repeatedly so a 20 min video could be made after editing hours of raw footage. In the cases of real livestreams, streamers will also use emetic measure after the stream, so they can quickly get ready for the next stream. This production cycle damages many people's health and results in serious food waste. It becomes a public secret for its popularity and soon attracts the authority's attention calling to end or fundamentally rectify such practices."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Waste ," Milk pouring at ""Youth with You 3"" ","The talent selection show ""Youth With You 3"" is the third season of the series featuring 119 male trainees competing to form a final group of 9 through global viewers' votes. It is produced by a Chinese video platform ""iQiyi"" and was broadcast on it since February 18, 2021. The controversy centered at the serious food waste due to the platform's publicity strategy of printing QR codes inside the yogurt drink bottles to enable fans of the show to support their favorite contestants."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Waste ," Milk pouring at ""Youth with You 3"" ","Due to the high popularity and large fan base of the show and individual contestants, the craze for voting triggered large food waste because supporters would buy hundreds of thousands of bottles of the drink to only get the QR code. But because people cannot finish the drink, they would simply pour them out."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Waste ," Milk pouring at ""Youth with You 3"" ","This has gone beyond individuals' actions of food waste, instead it shows that bout 40 to 50 people were hired for the job every day.In early May, a video went viral on Chinese internet, showing tens of people hired to open the caps of those drinks and then pour the milk out. It is reported that by estimate, there were roughly 270,000 bottles of the beverage being wasted. The shocking visuals drove lots of Chinese netizens mad for such excessive food waste only for supporting the idols."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Waste ," Milk pouring at ""Youth with You 3"" ","Some of them indicate that if they don't want the drinks, they can simply give them out to delivery men, workers on construction sites and such. But the truth is, it is something hard to be implemented. Since the supporters have to open the lids to retrieve the QR code, the dairy drinks will go bad very soon. Giving out tons of drinks that have been opened could also be problematic if there were cases of illness or food-poisoning. This controversy soon caught the attention of the government."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Waste ," Milk pouring at ""Youth with You 3"" ","Beijing Municipal Radio and Television Bureau on May 5 ordered for Youth with You Season 3 to be suspended, days before the grand finale scheduled to be aired. It is believed that the platform and sponsors' actions in inducing consumption of crazy fan behavior and the resulting food waste has violated laws in China.

 Clean Plate Campaign and Food Waste ," Milk pouring at ""Youth with You 3"" ","In the following days, iQiyi and Mengniu Dairy apologized on their social media account, the final round of the competition was cancelled and all the voting channels were closed."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Anti-Corruption Campaign , Level of corruption before the campaign ,"China's level of state corruption is pervasive before the anti-corruption campaign. The Los Angeles Times in 2008 estimated that corruption in China is as high as roughly 3%-15% of China's seven trillion dollar (USD) economy. Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index 2012 also ranks China the 80th most corrupt country out of 176. Even the Chinese government knows the seriousness itself, The 2012 Anti-Corruption Blue Book, published by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences indicates that China's corruption touches upon all aspects of the society."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Anti-Corruption Campaign , Level of corruption before the campaign ,"Political corruption hinders economic development, people's trust towards the government and social stability, which are all dangerous signals for the incumbent administration. Especially considering that the last round of concerns over state corruption led to demonstrations across the country in the 1980s, which finally escalated to a serious confrontation known as the Tiananmen Incident. So decades later, when the issue of corruption rose onto the surface again, it makes perfect sense for CCP leader Xi Jinping to launch the anti-corruption campaign to curb extreme corruption within the party and within the bureaucratic system."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Anti-Corruption Campaign , Level of corruption before the campaign ,"Because of the close bond between corruption and extravagant government dining, part of Xi's campaign made use of the grass-root movement of ""Clean Plate Campaign"" in early 2013 to make government funding usage more transparent and restrained. Beijing Youth Daily in 2013 presented a shocking survey results indicating that 97.8% of respondents in the survey felt that Chinese officials were wasting public funds. Among them, there are 33.8% people believed that official reception was the place those funds were wasted, like for lavish feasts."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Anti-Corruption Campaign , Impact ,"The large food waste which is the key issue dealt by the Clean Plate Campaign is largely contributed by the excessive government funding on dining tables. The director of the Institute of Law and Social Sciences at Renmin University of China, Zhou Xiaozheng justified the connection between fighting waste and fighting corruption with clear evidence. ""since the issuance of Mr."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Anti-Corruption Campaign , Impact ,"Xi's eight-point guide for official conduct at the end of 2012, an average of 3,000 metric tons of kitchen waste per day had been reduced in Beijing (20-30% of total kitchen waste, depending on the data source), mainly due to reduced public consumption"". The timing coincides with the ""Clean Plate Campaign"" which started in January 2013, when top officials including Xi Jinping himself and numerous state news reports supported the movement by stressing the importance of reducing food waste and emphasizing the significance of stopping lavish banquets using government funding seen everywhere in Chinese bureaucracies at the time."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Anti-Corruption Campaign , Impact ,"In 2012, it is reported that government officials spent $48 billion on state banquets, but due to the ""Clean Plate Campaign"" bonding with the anti-corruption campaign, the sale of luxury food items has been cut in half, according to China' s Commerce Ministry. And in Beijing and Shanghai, there have been business drop by as much as 35% in the catering industry.The campaign shows significant results in halting widespread extravagant dining using taxpayers' money. Even four years after the campaign, people indicate a higher confidence in public funding and officials' banquets."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Anti-Corruption Campaign , Impact ,"The Chairman of the Board at New Century Tourism Group Co., Ltd. told reporter in 2017 that there has been a sharp decline in food waste from officials' banquet, which was made possible due to the limited use of government funding because they are more likely to waste food while using others' money"". But along with the decline in lavish feasts held in outside restaurants, there are increasing waste in the dining halls of those government institutions."
 Clean Plate Campaign and Anti-Corruption Campaign , Impact ,"Due to the tradition of ""rewarding the public servants"", food provided in the dining halls at government institutions are provided at a close to zero price, much lower than the market price. Since the campaign, there are more dining halls that were built and decorated luxuriously, often including private rooms for inviting and treating guests. This phenomenon shows the incompleteness of the campaign because waste are still largely present in this form while there is less public exposure and social influence."
 Controversies , Domestic responses ,"Chinese people largely responded very positively and actively to the campaign in 2013. This movement took the opportunity of the early stage of internet development, and successfully used this platform to achieve high publicity, social mobilization and education purposes. This could be seen through the massive participation under the original post and the general topic on the social media platform Weibo, where many netizens voluntarily joined the movement by showing pictures of clean plates after meals. It shows that within days since the movement started with the Weibo post, there have been over 50 million retweets of the original post."
 Controversies , Domestic responses ,"This number is extraordinary considering the relatively limited Internet access ten years ago. Putting it into context, the ""Clean Plate Campaign"" was really a phenomenon at the time. Beyond the internet realm, dining places like the restaurants also participated in movement to actively seek positive changes. It started in the beginning of the movement, there were quite a few restaurants participating in hanging poster and handing out flyers on reducing food waste in Beijing. Later, as the popularity spread to the country, restaurants in different provinces start to implement different tools to reduce food waste."
 Controversies , Domestic responses ,"Attempts include offering half-sized dishes, to-go boxes/bags, and additional rewards for customers who finish all their food. Educational institutions also followed up on this movement very quickly. Many schools use different approaches to encourage students not to waste food. Some methods focuses on education, which include engaging parents, telling stories and singing related songs to educate children the significance of reducing food waste; some methods changed the way of dining like reducing the serving portion based on students' different needs."
 Controversies , Domestic responses ,"Some methods uses the rewarding mechanism, honoring kids and classes who do well in participating related activities and eat up their food. There are also activities like bringing students to rural areas to experience farming and more frugal living."
 Controversies , Domestic responses ,"It is reported that the University of Science and Technology Beijing indicated that the food waste has been reduced from 35 to 40 barrels in the two dining halls on campus to 22-25 barrels since the ""Clean Plate Campaign"", which is almost 40% decrease from the original level.The government also contributed greatly to this campaign by increasing publicity, setting regulations on government funded-dining and local governments' supervision and monitoring on private effort. Starting on January 20, different state media published commentaries and reports endorsing the movement."
 Controversies , Domestic responses ,"On 28th, Xi Jinping instructed on the issue by stressing the significance of disciplining party members and state officials' public-funded dining behaviors and urging the relevant authorities to implement measures to ensure food security. Individuals and groups in China have been very used to and acceptant to the guidelines from above."
 Controversies , Domestic responses ,"Some of the effort by restaurants and schools mentioned above were also in part made possible because of the various papers and instructions from above demanding changes, for example the issue of ""The Announcement about doing frugal education and establishing economical schools"" by the Ministry of Education on February 26, 2013. The most solid major achievement from the state's effort is to successfully regulate the officials in wasting taxpayers' money on lavish banquets, which helps to reduce an average of 3,000 metric tons of kitchen waste per day in Beijing only."
 Controversies , International responses ,International responses towards the movement in 2013 is also mainly positive. People looked at Chinese huge food waste as a real problem and compliments the campaign to be a positive influence that could change the situation.
 Controversies , International responses ,"Responding to the challenge of cutting down on waste among China's newly wealthy, some said that ""a new grassroots ""Clean Your Plate"" campaign is gaining steam, and starting to change the way people think about leftovers"".As Zhang Ye, one helped organize China's ""Clean Plate campaign"" says, the movement ""started from bottom to top, and then was promoted from top to bottom."" So some of the negative responses internationally came from the skepticism of the Chinese state's intervention."
 Controversies , International responses ,"Some media showed concern over the duration and systemic impact of this campaign: ""the operation against food waste develops into a movement of political importance, it may render the campaign short-lived, instead of making real changes in the institutional system"". The reasoning behind it is that people need to fully understand the problem to deploy the best strategy to change, however the government's top-down measure is often too arbitrary and ""one size fits all"" which usually only eliminate the problem on the surface while causing new unintended problems. There were two examples given to support this argument."
 Controversies , International responses ,"First, an annual banquet of a government agency was suddenly called off after serving the first few dishes when officials learned about the attitude and regulation above, which ends up wasting all those food prepared while those people will still find another place to get them fed. The second one is a at school, where students were too afraid of leftovers that a student threw up for finishing a dish, while another cried over a meatball given by mistake. These reports suggested that the government's intervention actually harmed the grass-root campaign and hindered more creative and humanitarian approaches."
 Controversies , Responses to the 2020 Clean Plate Campaign ,Xi's call for a second round of Clean Plate campaign directed international attention to the rising food insecurity in China. Xi's message is seen as an emphasis on self-reliance of food supply amid a growing tension with the United States and short-terms disruptions to its food production and importation such as the COVID-19 pandemic and summer floods. The vague wording left plenty of room for speculation to be filled up by official media accounts squashing worries of an immediate food shortage.
 Controversies , Responses to the 2020 Clean Plate Campaign ,"The timing of Xi's message is also particularly important, released only weeks after the massive summer floods.The state's intervention on the daily life of citizens is another heated topic. BBC reports critics on the ""N-1"" ordering limit as ""too rigid"", and other comments questioning why the campaign does not target the lavish banquets of the officials."
 Controversies , Responses to the 2020 Clean Plate Campaign ,"CNN quotes political analyst Wu Qiang that ""Even the most politically apathetic person can feel their daily life habits challenged and threatened (by this campaign)"" while highlighting the privacy intrusion in some local government's practices, who reportedly monitor food waste by encouraging citizens to report such behaviors, or installing surveillance cameras next to the food dumps in government canteens."
 History ,,"The first community fridges were set up in Germany, by a group called Foodsharing. The next community fridge was started in Spain in 2015. Community fridges draw inspiration from food initiatives such as the 1960s Black Panther Free Breakfast program, which was the first free breakfast program for students in the US and inspired the USDA's school breakfast program.In the UK, early community fridges were set up at Frome, South Derbyshire, Brixton (London), and Botley (Oxford)."
 History ,,"A national network of community fridges was set up in July 2017 by the environmental charity Hubbub UK, which offers a free support service to new projects.Community fridges are a rapidly-growing phenomenon, with fridges also recently set up in New Zealand, India, Israel, the Netherlands, and Canada (Community Fridges Toronto has seven fridges)."
 History , COVID-19 pandemic ,"Community fridges have recently made a wide emergence in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, community fridges were developed in response to a significant increase in food insecurity. In New York City, community fridges, nicknamed “Friendly Fridges,” were introduced in February 2020, the first one placed by an activist group, In Our Hearts. In Our Hearts has now set up at least 14 of the 70 fridges around New York City. In Philadelphia, Dr. Michelle Nelson launched a Mama-Tee Community Fridge in North Philly, now there are 18 of them."
 History , COVID-19 pandemic ,"Using New York City as a model, community fridges have popped up in cities across the U.S. including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, and more. As of September 2021, Los Angeles County has 14 community fridges. In Chicago, as of September 2021, there are 26 community fridges providing support to the community. The Love Fridge is a mutual aid network placing community refrigerators across the city. In Atlanta, Georgia, Latisha Springer, started Free99Fridge, a grassroots organization providing food to communities through their community fridge network. The organization maintains five community fridges throughout the metro Atlanta area."
 History , COVID-19 pandemic ,"In the Greater Boston Area, the first community fridge was started in Jamaica Plain in September 2020. Soon after, another fridge emerged in the neighborhood of Dorchester, Boston's largest neighborhood. As of September 2021, fridges in the neighborhoods of Allston, Fenway, Mattapan, and Roslindale have emerged, as well as in the cities of Somerville, Cambridge, Worcester. In Thailand, entrepreneur Supakit Kulchartvijit's Pantry of Sharing pantry cabinets, a variation on the community fridges, was launched in May 2020 in Bangkok and Rayong."
 History , COVID-19 pandemic ,"Thailand's SCG Foundation emulated Kulchartvijit's initiative, putting up a total 60 pantry cabinets in the country by 25 May 2020.The following year in the Philippines as the pandemic dragged on, a trend utilizing a similar concept emerged across the country. Small carts carrying essential items were parked along sidewalks for locals to obtain any of the items without charge."
 History , COVID-19 pandemic ,"The first such cart to be reported was started by the Members Church of God International on March 14, 2021.Also in the Philippines, a similar idea under the term ""community pantry"" was started on Maginhawa Street in the Teacher's Village neighborhood of Quezon City on April 14, 2021. This initiative gained a wider media coverage than the MCGI initiative, resulting in the mushrooming of hundreds of similar initiatives throughout the country."
 History , COVID-19 pandemic ,"In about a week after the Maginhawa pantry's launch, more than 100 pantries were set up in various locations; a week thereafter more than 300 pantries had already been set up.Following the Maginhawa movement's example in the Philippines, various community pantries were set up in East Timor. Challenges surrounding community fridges include maintaining cleanliness, ensuring food safety, and making sure that mutual aid model of community fridges is not abused (e.g. that nobody profits from the food)."
 History , COVID-19 pandemic ,"In the UK, setting up a community fridge requires a rota of volunteers to clean the fridge and check the food; public liability insurance; the support of the local authority environmental health officer; and, evidently, a fridge and associated waste bins. Several community fridges in Germany were threatened with closure due to health concerns.Community fridges are sometimes criticized for not providing a systemic solution to food insecurity."
 History , COVID-19 pandemic ,"Fridges are needed by those who are actively hungry or do not have the means to access nutritious food, but do not address underlying causes of food insecurity.Fridges are also occasionally criticized for not addressing the needs of a community. Often, food provided to the fridge does not meet the cultural and nutrition needs of the community. In addition, there is often controversy surrounding the legality of community fridges. Policies addressing maintaining a community fridge vary widely from community to community. Fridges must be placed on private property, which makes them dependent on the owners willingness to participate."
 History , COVID-19 pandemic ,"In Boston's Allston Neighborhood, the Allston community fridge was forced to move because new property owners were no longer willing to house them. Little Free Pantries and Blessing Boxes Free Blockbuster A Washington Post feature on free fridges in Philadelphia"
 History ,,"The paper plate was invented by the German bookbinder Hermann Henschel in Luckenwalde in 1867. In 1908, Samuel J. Crumbine was a public health officer in Kansas. He was on a train when he witnessed one of his tuberculosis patients taking a drink of water from a common dipper and water bucket (a publicly shared way of drinking water) in the car. Right behind his patient was a young girl who drank from the same dipper and bucket. This inspired him to launch a crusade to ban publicly shared or common utensils in public places."
 History ,,"Taking note of the trend, Lawrence Luellen and Hugh Moore invented a disposable paper cup called the ""Health Cup"" and later renamed the ""Dixie Cup"".Single-use cone cups were followed by the commercialization of single-use plates and bowls, wooden cutlery, and paper food wraps. By the 1930s these products were widely used to feed the men and women who worked on the remote dams, bridges and roads of the Works Progress Administration. In the 1940s they were used to feed defense factory workers.After World War II, foodservice packaging materials like plastic and polystyrene foam were developed."
 History ,,"The unique properties of these materials (insulation and weight reduction) and their ability to be made into a variety of shapes and sizes, provided foodservice operators, and consumers, with a wider variety of packaging choices.A major development in disposable foodservice packaging happened in 1948 when the newly founded McDonald's restaurant closed to revamp its menu. Along with changing their menu items, the restaurant wanted to change the way it handled dishwashing and dishwashers, car hops and wait staff, and storage, breakage and (customer) theft of tableware."
 History ,,"When the McDonald's re-opened six months later, its meals were no longer served with the use of glasses, plates or cutlery, and were taken away from the restaurant by the customers. The use of disposable foodservice packaging is a step toward preventing foodborne disease. By being used only once, these products help reduce food contamination and the spread of diseases.The U.S."

 History ,,"Drug Administration’s Food Code authoritatively spells out the sanitary and health advantages of single-use foodservice packaging in specific situations: ""A food establishment without facilities...for cleaning and sanitizing kitchenware and tableware shall provide only single-use kitchenware, single-service articles, and single-use articles for use by food employees and single-service articles for use by consumers."" The Food Code further states ""in situations in which the reuse of multiuse items could result in foodborne illness to consumers, single-service and single-use articles must be used to ensure safety."" Disposable foodservice packaging can be made from a number of materials, each with its own uses and benefits."
 Materials , Aluminum ,"Aluminum is used to manufacture foils, wraps, bags, containers, and trays."
 Materials , Plastics ,"Many disposable foodservice products can be made of plastic or plastic-coated paper: cups, plates, bowls, trays, food containers and cutlery, for example. Plastics are used because the material is lightweight and holds the temperature of hot/cold food and beverages. Foamed polystyrene (sometimes referred to as Styrofoam) is in one of the most common types of plastics used for foodservice packaging, in the form of the foam food container. Non-foamed polystyrene is sometimes also used for utensils or plastic plates. Polyethylene and other plastics are also used. Plastic wrap is sometimes used to cover a tray of food."
 Materials , Plastics ,Many plastics are marked with the SPI recycling codes for identification.
 Materials , Paper and paperboard ,"Disposable foodservice products made from paper, paperboard, and corrugated fiberboard: including cups, plates, bowls, napkins, carryout bags, trays, egg cartons, doilies and tray liners. Some paper products are coated - mostly with plastic - or treated to improve wet strength or grease resistance. Paper and paperboard packaging like pizza trays, French fry trays, Chinese noodle soup boxes, hamburger clamshell trays, etc., are developed by printers utilizing paper-converting equipment such as tray formers. Molded pulp products are made from recycled newsprint and are formed under heat and pressure into plates, bowls, trays and cup carriers. Molded pulp is readily recyclable."
 Materials , Wood and bamboo ,"In recent years, manufacturers have been working on developing more sustainable alternatives to traditional plastic products. Amongst them are plates and cutlery made from bamboo and wood (mostly birch). Throughout the entire life cycle of wood products, there can be far fewer environmental repercussions than with traditional plastics, and possibly fewer with bioplastics like PLA, which composts into lactic acid. Wooden products decompose on average in the matter of a few months. Currently wood and bamboo products are more costly than traditional plastics and not as widely available, which makes it challenging for some restaurants to switch."
 Materials , Alternative materials ,"A number of manufacturers are now making disposable foodservice products from a combination of natural starches, recycled fibers, water, air, and natural minerals. These composite products include cups, plates, bowls, cutlery, sandwich wraps, food containers and trays. Ideally these products are easily biodegradable and composted after use. The material used to make these kinds of disposable foodservice products is primarily PLA or polylactic acid. Some products are made from a mixture of PLA and pulp fibers that are molded into disposable foodservice items with heat and pressure."
 Materials , Alternative materials ,"Others are made from a composite or mixture of starch and other materials, such as limestone and recycled fibers, to give them additional strength. Areca palm plates are made from dry fallen leaves from the Areca catechu palm (betel tree). This trees shed the old dried leaves along with their sheath. These sheaths are separated from leaves and sent to the factory. The sheaths are then soaked and washed in clean water to remove the dust and sand particles. The sheaths are hot pressed and made into areca palm plates, bowls and food containers."
 Materials , Alternative materials ,"Compared to other disposable items, areca palm products are 100% natural, eco-friendly. No synthetic adhesives or binders used in the manufacturing. By reducing the need for equipment and additional labor, disposable foodservice packaging is an economical alternative to multiuse items and eliminates the need for dishwashers and other support equipment (racks, carts, dollies, shelving, bins). It can also save money on water and energy used by dishwashers and can eliminate the need to replace reusables that are broken, damaged, stolen or accidentally discarded. Disposable tableware was a key part of the business strategy of chain fast food restaurants in the US."
 Materials , Alternative materials ,"In order for the business model to work, fast food chains, notably McDonald's, had to convince consumers through advertising campaigns to carry their own tableware to a waste bins, in order to avoid labor expenses incurred in clearing tables. By establishing a custom in which customers are encouraged to carry disposables, some of the internal costs of the disposable tableware can be offset."
 Environmental concerns , Comparison with washable foodservice products ,"According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, paper and plastic foodservice packaging discarded in the country's municipal solid waste stream accounted 1.3 percent in 2007 (by weight) of municipal solid waste. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also says that an often-cited waste prevention measure is the use of washable plates, cups, and napkins instead of the disposable variety. While this will reduce solid waste, it will have other environmental effects, such as increased water and energy use. Overall, reusable dishware – even if only offered to customers for on-site use – is considered to be the best environmental choice."
 Environmental concerns , Cost of recycling ,"Collection costs, the value of scrap material, and increased energy expenditures create an additional economic barrier to recycling foodservice packaging. While recycling foodservice packaging is difficult, recycled materials are being used in some foodservice packaging."
 Environmental concerns , Environmental footprint ,"Many people are working on reducing the environmental footprint of packaging for food service. Often a Life-cycle assessment is valuable to determine the effects throughout the entire system. Some actions include: Packaging of incoming food and supplies can work towards the broad sustainable packaging guidelines offered by many organizations. This includes the recycling of packaging generated within the restaurant. Packaging products used by the restaurant can include specified amounts of recycled content in the products. Many packaging products can be compostable, but care is needed to match the needs of regional composting facilities."
 Environmental concerns , Environmental footprint ,"Sometimes products can be certified to meet international standards such as ASTM International D6400, ASTM D6868, and EN 13432. Some single-use food packaging is recyclable but food contamination of products is often a problem for recyclers."
 Environmental concerns ," Illusion of recycling and ""recyclable"" claims ","Disposable-product manufacturers frequently include ""recyclable"" or ""please recycle"" indicia on their products; however the availability and effectiveness of such recycling campaigns is limited. A common approach of restaurants featuring disposable tableware is to label one or more of their waste bins as ""recycling"", although realistically, the amount of washing required for effective recycling would make such ""recycling"" unrealistic. In addition to greenwashing, these approaches are intended to encourage consumers to buy disposable tableware. Some experts view a total ban of single-use packaging as the only solution."
 Environmental concerns ," Illusion of recycling and ""recyclable"" claims ","For example, the Chinese government stated that by the end of 2020, non-degradable bags will be banned in major cities, and by 2022, the policy will come into force in smaller settlements. In the European Union (EU), the Directive on single-use plastics (SUPD, EU 2019/904), in force since 3 July 2021, bans the retail sale of disposable food packaging items. The ban applies in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (not in Switzerland), and the following items are banned: cutlery (forks, knives, spoons, and chopsticks); plates; beverage stirrers; food containers made of expanded polystyrene (i.e."

 History ,,"The garbage disposal unit was invented in 1927 by John W. Hammes, an architect working in Racine, Wisconsin. He applied for a patent in 1933 that was issued in 1935. His InSinkErator company put his disposer on the market in 1940.Hammes' claim is disputed, as General Electric introduced a garbage disposal unit in 1935, known as the Disposall. In many cities in the United States in the 1930s and the 1940s, the municipal sewage system had regulations prohibiting placing food waste (garbage) into the system."
 History ,,"InSinkErator spent considerable effort, and was highly successful in convincing many localities to rescind these prohibitions.Many localities in the United States prohibited the use of disposers. For many years, garbage disposers were illegal in New York City because of a perceived threat of damage to the city's sewer system."
 History ,,"After a 21-month study with the NYC Department of Environmental Protection, the ban was rescinded in 1997 by local law 1997/071, which amended section 24-518.1, NYC Administrative Code.In 2008, the city of Raleigh, North Carolina attempted a ban on the replacement and installation of garbage disposers, which also extended to outlying towns sharing the city's municipal sewage system, but rescinded the ban one month later."
 History ,,"In the United States, 50% of homes had disposal units as of 2009, compared with only 6% in the United Kingdom and 3% in Canada.In Sweden, some municipalities encourage the installation of disposers in order to increase the production of biogas.In Britain, Worcestershire County Council and Herefordshire Council started to subsidize the purchase of garbage disposal units in 2005, in order to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill and the carbon footprint of garbage runs."
 History ,,"However, the use of macerators was banned in Scotland in 2016 in non-rural areas where food waste collection is available, and banned in Northern Ireland in 2017. They are expected to be banned for businesses in England and Wales in 2023. The intention is to reduce water use. Many other countries in Europe have banned or intend to ban macerators. The intention is to realise the resource value of food waste, and reduce sewer blockages."
 History ,,"Food scraps range from 10% to 20% of household waste, and are a problematic component of municipal waste, creating public health, sanitation and environmental problems at each step, beginning with internal storage and followed by truck-based collection."
 History ,,"Burned in waste-to-energy facilities, the high water-content of food scraps means that their heating and burning consumes more energy than it generates; buried in landfills, food scraps decompose and generate methane gas, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.The premise behind the proper use of a disposer is to effectively regard food scraps as liquid (averaging 70% water, like human waste), and use existing infrastructure (underground sewers and wastewater treatment plants) for its management. Modern wastewater plants are effective at processing organic solids into fertilizer products (known as biosolids), with advanced facilities also capturing methane for energy production."
 History ,,"A high-torque, insulated electric motor, usually rated at 250–750 W (1⁄3–1 hp) for a domestic unit, spins a circular turntable mounted horizontally above it. Induction motors rotate at 1,400–2,800 rpm and have a range of starting torques, depending on the method of starting used. The added weight and size of induction motors may be of concern, depending on the available installation space and construction of the sink bowl."
 History ,,"Universal motors, also known as series-wound motors, rotate at higher speeds, have high starting torque, and are usually lighter, but are noisier than induction motors, partially due to the higher speeds and partially because the commutator brushes rub on the slotted commutator.Inside the grinding chamber there is a rotating metal turntable onto which the food waste drops. Two swiveling and two fixed metal impellers mounted on top of the plate near the edge then fling the food waste against the grind ring repeatedly."
 History ,,"Sharp cutting edges in the grind ring break down the waste until it is small enough to pass through openings in the ring. Sometimes the waste goes through a third stage where an undercutter disc further chops it, whereupon it is flushed down the drain. Usually, there is a partial rubber closure, known as a splashguard, on the top of the disposal unit to prevent food waste from flying back up out of the grinding chamber. It may also be used to attenuate noise from the grinding chamber for quieter operation."
 History ,,There are two main types of garbage disposers—continuous feed and batch feed. Continuous feed models are used by feeding in waste after being started and are more common. Batch feed units are used by placing waste inside the unit before being started. These types of units are started by placing a specially designed cover over the opening. Some covers manipulate a mechanical switch while others allow magnets in the cover to align with magnets in the unit. Small slits in the cover allow water to flow through.
 History ,,"Batch feed models are considered safer, since the top of the disposal is covered during operation, preventing foreign objects from falling in. Waste disposal units may jam, but can usually be cleared either by forcing the turntable round from above or by turning the motor using a hex-key wrench inserted into the motor shaft from below. Especially hard objects accidentally or deliberately introduced, such as metal cutlery, can damage the waste disposal unit and become damaged themselves, although recent advances, such as swivel impellers, have been made to minimize such damage.Some higher-end units have an automatic reversing jam clearing feature."
 History ,,"By using a slightly more-complicated centrifugal starting switch, the split-phase motor rotates in the opposite direction from the previous run each time it is started. This can clear minor jams, but is claimed to be unnecessary by some manufacturers: Since the early sixties, many disposal units have utilized swivel impellers which make reversing unnecessary.Some other kinds of garbage disposal units are powered by water pressure, rather than electricity. Instead of the turntable and grind ring described above, this alternative design has a water-powered unit with an oscillating piston with blades attached to chop the waste into fine pieces."
 History ,,"Because of this cutting action, they can handle fibrous waste. Water-powered units take longer than electric ones for a given amount of waste and need fairly high water pressure to function properly. Kitchen waste disposal units increase the load of organic carbon that reaches the water treatment plant, which in turn increases the consumption of oxygen. Metcalf and Eddy quantified this impact as 0.04 pounds (18 g) of biochemical oxygen demand per person per day where disposers are used."
 History ,,"An Australian study that compared in-sink food processing to composting alternatives via a life-cycle assessment found that while the in-sink disposer performed well with respect to climate change, acidification, and energy usage, it did contribute to eutrophication and toxicity potentials.This may result in higher costs for energy needed to supply oxygen in secondary operations. However, if the waste water treatment is finely controlled, the organic carbon in the food may help to keep the bacterial decomposition running, as carbon may be deficient in that process."
 History ,,"This increased carbon serves as an inexpensive and continuous source of carbon necessary for biologic nutrient removal.One result is larger amounts of solid residue from the waste-water treatment process. According to a study at the East Bay Municipal Utility District's wastewater treatment plant funded by the EPA, food waste produces three times the biogas as compared to municipal sewage sludge."

 History ,,"Daily water usage varies, but is typically 1 US gallon (3.8 L) of water per person per day, comparable to an additional toilet flush. One survey of these food processing units found a slight increase in household water use."
 History ,,"The integration of shallow oxidisation ponds of microalgae was demonstrated by Golueke & Oswald in the 1960s. The widespread global implementation of these systems can be largely credited to Prof George Lai Chan-Yu-Thim (02 March 1924 Mauritius-08 October 2016 Mauritius) from ZERI. Zero waste agriculture is now practiced in China (ecological farming), Columbia (integrated food & waste management systems) & Fiji (integrated farming systems), India (integrated biogas farming), South Africa (BEAT Coop & African Agroecological Biotechnology Initiative) and Mauritius."
 History ,,"The Brazilian government has adopted integrated farming system as a major social technology for the uplifting of marginalized and subsistence farmers through coordination with TECPAR.Zero waste agriculture combines mature ecological farming practices that delivers an integrated balance of job creation, poverty relief, food security, energy security, water conservation, climate change relief, land security & stewardship. Zero waste agriculture is optimally practiced on small 1-5 ha sized family owned and managed farms and it complements traditional farming & animal husbandry as practiced in most third world communities. Zero Waste Agriculture also preserves local indigenous systems and existing agrarian cultural values and practices."
 History ,,"Zero waste agriculture presents a balance of economically, socially and ecologically benefits as it: optimizes food production in an ecological sound manner reduces water consumption through recycling and reduced evaporation provides energy security through the harvesting of biomethane (biogas) and the extraction of biodiesel from micro-algae, as a by-product of food production provides climate change relief through the substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from both traditional agriculture practices and fossil fuel usage reduces the use of pesticides through biodiverse farmingCertification of such farming practices is both challenging and an opportunity."

 Food Reuse Strategy ,,"412 Food Rescue is unique in that it relies primarily on the efforts of volunteers to transport and deliver the food immediately. Their food distribution model pairs one of its 450 donor organizations, often grocery stores and restaurants with other nonprofit partners so that the food may taken to individuals with no access to them.Volunteers are notified of the pick-ups and deliveries to be made by the use of their Food Rescue Hero application. As such, 412 Food Rescue does not maintain an inventory or store food in warehouses."
 Food Reuse Strategy ,,It obtains fresh and healthy produce which is immediately delivered by a volunteer to the non-profit organization that then distributes it to the food insecure recipients.
 History , Beginnings ,"The organization was founded by Leah Lizarondo and Gisele Barreto Fetterman in March 2015. Lizarondo was inspired by the Free Store, a free clothing outlet in Braddock run by co-founder Fetterman. The Free store gathers surplus goods and distribute them for free to those in need.At the time of founding, food insecurity affected 14.2% of Pittsburgh. However, around 31% of food produced went straight to landfills. The two focused their efforts in solving both those problems by developing a means to bring the food to those who need it."
 History , Beginnings ,"Initially, 412 Food Rescue used the social media platform Facebook to recruit volunteers to transport food between donors and recipients. The organization has grown and shifted from the social media platform to their own application."
 History , Impact ,"412 Food Rescue has virtually eliminated emergency referrals, bringing them down from 5–7 a month to 0 on official reports. The organization has a 98 to 99 percent success rate with food pickups and deliveries. The organization helped furloughed federal employees during the 2019 government shutdown by setting up food distribution centers."
 Programs , 412 Food Rescue App ,"412 Food Rescue's reliance on the efforts of thousands of volunteers is made possible through an application launched by the organization in November 2016 called Food Rescue Hero, which is available in both the Google Play Store and the iTunes App Store. Over 7,000 people have downloaded and registered on the application.A volunteer who is a registered user of the application will receive an alert whenever a prospective donor wishes to donate."
 Programs , 412 Food Rescue App ,"Details including the food, the quantity and the distance is made available to volunteer, who provides his or her own vehicle to pick-up the food and deliver it to the non-profit organization that receives it. The application's algorithm matches the available food to the suitable recipient."
 Programs , Hidden Harvest ,"Hidden Harvest retrieves fresh fruit from unharvested trees, orchards and farms around the city. A map is crowd-sourced highlighting places to collect blackberries, mulberries, etc. Most of these fruits are apples which are donated to partner organizations. A substantial portion of these fruits can no longer be consumed as food which led to an initiative with Wigle Whiskey where the foraged apples are instead turned into pommeau."
 Programs , UglyCSA ,"The UglyCSA program allowing consumers to purchase fresh produce that has fallen short of cosmetic standards. The organization and its founders have gained widespread recognition for their efforts. Leah Lizarondo, the organization's CEO and co-founder has taken home many accolades including: 2018 Pittsburgh Smart 50 honoree and Impact award, Smart Business' Person to Watch 2017, Jekko's Pittsburgh Personality You Should Know 2016, and Pittsburgh City Paper's Pittsburghers of the Year. 412 Food Rescue won second place and $110,000 at the 2017 UpPrize, a social-innovation challenge.

 Operational models ,,"With thousands of food banks operating around the world, there are many different models.A major distinction between food banks is whether or not they operate on the ""front line"" model, giving out food directly to the hungry, or whether they operate with the ""warehouse"" model, supplying food to intermediaries like food pantries, soup kitchens and other front-line organizations. In the US, Australia and to an extent in Canada, the standard model is for food banks to act as warehouses rather than as suppliers to the end user, though there are exceptions."
 Operational models ,,"In other countries, food banks usually hand out food parcels direct to hungry people, providing the service that in the US is offered by food pantries. Another distinction is between the charity model and the labor union model."
 Operational models ,,"At least in Canada and the US, food banks run by charities often place relatively more weight on the salvaging of food that would otherwise go to waste, and on encouraging voluntarism, whereas those run by unions can place greater emphasis on feeding the hungry by any means available, on providing work for the unemployed, and on education, especially on explaining to users their civil rights.In the US, cities will often have a single food bank that acts as a centralized warehouse and will serve several hundred front-line agencies."
 Operational models ,,"Like a blood bank, that warehouse serves as a single collection and distribution point for food donations. A food bank operates a lot like a for-profit food distributor, but in this case, it distributes food to charities, not to food retailers. There is often no charge to the charities, but some food banks do charge a small ""shared maintenance"" fee to help defray the cost of storage and distribution. For many US food banks, most of their donated food comes from food left over from the normal processes of for-profit companies."
 Operational models ,,"It can come from any part of the food chain, e.g. from growers who have produced too much or whose food is not sufficiently visually appealing; from manufacturers who overproduced; or from retailers who over-ordered. Often the product is approaching or past its ""sell by"" date. In such cases, the food bank liaises with the food industry and with regulators to make sure the food is safe and legal to distribute and eat."
 Operational models ,,"Other sources of food include the general public, sometimes in the form of ""food drives"", and government programs that buy and distribute excess farm products mostly to help support higher commodity prices. Food banks can also buy food either at market prices or from wholesalers and retailers at discounted prices, often at a cost. Sometimes farmers will allow food banks to send gleaners to salvage leftover crops for free once their primary harvest is complete."
 Operational models ,,"A few food banks have even taken over their farms, though such initiatives have not always been successful.Many food banks don't accept fresh produce, preferring canned or packaged food due to health and safety concerns, though some have tried to change this as part of a growing worldwide awareness of the importance of nutrition."
 Operational models ,,"As an example, in 2012, London Food Bank (Canada) started accepting perishable food, reporting that as well as the obvious health benefits, there were noticeable emotional benefits to recipients when they were given fresh food.Summer can be a challenging time for food banks, particularly in regions where school children are usually given regular free meals during term time. Spikes in demand can coincide with periods where donations fall due to folk being on holiday."
 North America , History ,"In the U.S. and sometimes in Canada, food banks don't typically give food direct to the hungry. Instead, they act as warehouses, supplying front-line agencies like this Californian soup kitchen. (Picture taken in 2009, and shows members of the United States Navy serving visitors.) The world's first food bank was St. Mary's Food Bank in Phoenix, Arizona, founded by John van Hengel in 1967. According to sociology professor Janet Poppendieck, the hunger within the US was widely considered to be a solved problem until the mid-1960s."
 North America , History ,"By the mid-sixties, several states had ended the free distribution of federal food surpluses, instead providing an early form of food stamps which had the benefit of allowing recipients to choose food of their liking, rather than having to accept whatever happened to be in surplus at the time."
 North America , History ,"However, there was a minimum charge and some people could not afford the stamps, leading to severe hunger.One response from American society to the rediscovery of hunger was to step up the support provided by soup kitchens and similar civil society food relief agencies – some of these dated back to the Great Depression and earlier. In 1965, while volunteering for a community dining room, van Hengel learned that grocery stores often had to throw away food that had damaged packaging or was near expiration."
 North America , History ,"He started collecting that food for the dining room but soon had too much for that one program. He thought of creating a central location from which any agency can receive donations. Described as a classic case of ""if you build it they will come"", the first food bank was created with the help of St. Mary's Basilica, which became the namesake of the organization. Food banks spread across the United States, and Canada. By 1976, van Hengel had established the organization known today as Feeding America."
 North America , History ,"As of the early 21st century, their network of over 200 food banks provides support for 90,000 projects. Other large networks exist such as AmpleHarvest.org, created by CNN Hero and World Food Prize nominee Gary Oppenheimer which lists nearly 9,000 food pantries (1 out of every 4 in America) across all 50 states that are eager to receive surplus locally grown garden produce from any of America's 62 million home or community gardeners. In the 1980s, U.S. food banks began to grow rapidly."
 North America , History ,"A second response to the ""rediscovery"" of hunger in the mid-sixties had been extensive lobbying of politicians to improve welfare. Until the 1980s, this approach had a greater impact. In the 1970s, U.S. federal expenditure on hunger relief grew by about 500%, with food stamps distributed free of charge to those in greatest need. According to Poppendieck, welfare was widely considered preferable to grassroots efforts, as the latter could be unreliable, did not give recipients consumer-style choice in the same way as did food stamps, and risked recipients feeling humiliated by having to turn to charity."
 North America , History ,"In the early 1980s, Ronald Reagan's administration scaled back welfare provision, leading to a rapid rise in activity from grassroots hunger relief agencies. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, over 90% of food banks were established in the US after 1981. Poppendieck says that for the first few years after the change, there was vigorous opposition from the left, who argued that state welfare was much more suitable for meeting recipients needs. But in the decades that followed, food banks have become an accepted part of America's response to hunger."
 North America , History ,"Demand for the services of US food banks increased further in the late 1990s, after the ""end of welfare as we know it"" with Bill Clinton's Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. In Canada, foodbanks underwent a period of rapid growth after the cutbacks in welfare that took place in the mid-1990s. As early as the 1980s, food banks had also begun to spread from the United States to the rest of the world. The first European food bank was founded in France in 1984."
 North America , History ,"In the 1990s and early 2000s, food banks were established in South America, Africa, and Asia, in several cases with van Hengel acting as a consultant. In 2007, The Global FoodBanking Network was formed."
 North America , Food aid for pets ,"Some U.S. cities have organizations that provide dog and cat food for pets whose owners qualify for food assistance. For example, Daffy's Pet Soup Kitchen in Lawrenceville, Georgia is considered the largest pet food aid agency in Georgia, distributing over 800,000 pounds of dog and cat food in 2012. Daffy's Pet Soup Kitchen was started in 1997 by Tom Wargo, a repairman who was working in an elderly woman's home when he noticed her sharing her Meals On Wheels lunch with her pet cat because she could not afford cat food."
 North America , Food aid for pets ,"Daffy's was one of seven non-profits recognized by Barefoot Wine in 2013 through a $10,000 donation and by being featured on labels of the vintner's Impression Red Blend wines. Pet Buddies Food Pantry in Atlanta, Georgia is another example of an establishment that provides food aid for pets. The St. Augustine Humane Society in St. Augustine, Florida, distributes over 1,600 pounds of pet food each month to families who are experiencing economic hardship and cannot afford to feed their pets."
 North America , Food pantries for students ,"The college and University Food Bank Alliance, which was formed in 2012, has 570 campus food pantries nationwide. On-campus food pantries were available at 70% of State University of New York locations by 2019."
 North America , After the 2007 financial crisis ,"Following the financial crisis of 2007–08, and the lasting inflation in the price of food that began in late 2006, there has been a further increase in the number of individuals requesting help from American and Canadian food banks. By 2012, according to Food Banks Canada, over 850,000 Canadians needed help from a food bank each month."
 North America , After the 2007 financial crisis ,"For the United States, Gleaners Indiana Food bank reported in 2012 that there were then 50 million Americans struggling with food insecurity (about 1 in 6 of the population), with the number of individuals seeking help from food banks having increased by 46% since 2005. According to a 2012 UCLA Center for Health Policy Research study, there has been a 40% increase in demand for Californian food banks since 2008, with married couples who both work sometimes requiring the aid of food banks."
 North America , After the 2007 financial crisis ,"Dave Krepcho, director of the Second Harvest Food Bank in Orlando, has said that college-educated professional couples have begun to turn to food pantries.By mid-2012, US food banks had expressed concerns about the expected difficulty in feeding the hungry over the coming months. Rapidly rising demand has been coinciding with higher food prices and with a decrease in donations, partly as the food industry is becoming more efficient and so has less mislabelled and other slightly defective food to give away. Also, there has been less surplus federal food on offer."
 North America , After the 2007 financial crisis ,"Additionally, there have been recent decreases in federal funding, and Congress has been debating possible further cuts, including potentially billions of dollars from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamp program). In September 2012, Feeding America launched Hunger Action Month, with events planned all over the nation. Food banks and other agencies involved hoped to raise awareness that about one in six Americans are struggling with hunger and to get more Americans involved in helping out."
 North America , Food banks and COVID-19 ,"The COVID-19 outbreak impacted European food banks since value chains were notably disrupted and food banks lacked the support of volunteers. Compared to 2019, the amount of food distributed increased in 2020. Possibly through an increase in people in need. At the same time, the deliveries of shelf-stable food decreased by 20% due to panic shopping/Hoarding, especially at the beginning of the crisis.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on hunger in the United States. With many people losing their jobs and struggling to make ends meet, the demand for food assistance has increased dramatically."
 North America , Food banks and COVID-19 ,"According to Feeding America, the largest hunger relief organization in the United States, the number of people facing hunger in 2020 could reach as high as 54 million, including 18 million children. Food banks have been working tirelessly to respond to this increased need, while also facing their own challenges due to the pandemic."
 North America , The Impact of the Pandemic on Hunger ,"The pandemic has had a ripple effect on the economy, leading to widespread job loss and financial hardship for many families. As a result, more people are turning to food banks for assistance. In addition, school closures have left many children without access to the free or reduced-price meals they normally receive at school. This has further increased the demand for food assistance, particularly for families with children."
 North America , How Food Banks Have Responded ,"Food banks have had to adapt quickly to meet the increased demand for their services while also implementing safety protocols to protect staff, volunteers, and clients from the spread of COVID-19. Many food banks have shifted from their traditional model of distributing food through pantries and soup kitchens to a drive-through or curbside pickup model to minimize contact between people. Others have implemented home delivery services for seniors and others who are unable to leave their homes."
 North America , New Challenges and Opportunities ,"The pandemic has also presented new challenges and opportunities for food banks. On the one hand, they are facing a significant increase in demand for their services at a time when many traditional sources of food donations, such as grocery stores and restaurants, are facing their own challenges due to the pandemic. On the other hand, the pandemic has also led to an outpouring of support from individuals and organizations looking to help their communities. Food banks have been able to leverage this support to find new sources of food and funding to support their programs."
 North America , New Challenges and Opportunities ,"The first European food bank was opened in France in 1984. The first food bank in Italy was established in 1989. Similar to the UK's experience, food banks have become much more common across continental Europe since the crisis that began in 2008. In Spain, food banks can operate on the warehouse model, supplying a network of surrounding soup kitchens and other food relief agencies. The Spanish federation of food banks helped to feed about 800,000 people during 2008–11, according to the Carrefour Foundation."
 North America , New Challenges and Opportunities ,"By October 2014, Spain had 55 food banks in total, with the number who depend on them having increased to 1.5 million.In Belgium, food banks helped about 121,000 people in 2012. That was an increase of about 4,500 compared with 2011, the biggest increase since the start of the 2008 crisis. Belgian food banks account for about 65% of all food aid given out within the country.The number of food banks has increased rapidly in Germany, a country that weathered the crisis relatively well, and did not implement severe austerity measures."
 North America , New Challenges and Opportunities ,"In 2012, professor Sabine Pfeiffer of Munich University of Applied Sciences said there has been an ""explosion"" of food bank usage."
 Europe , European Union programs ,"While many European food banks have long been run by civil society with no government assistance, an EU-funded project, the Most deprived persons program (MDP), had specialized in supplying food to marginalized people who are not covered by the benefits system, who were in some cases reluctant to approach the more formal food banks. The program involved the EU buying surplus agricultural products, which were then distributed to the poor largely by Catholic churches."
 Europe , European Union programs ,"The MDP was wound down in late 2013 and was replaced by the Fund for European Aid to Most Deprived (FEAD), which is set to run until at least 2020. The FEAD program has a wider scope than the MDP, helping deprived people not just with food aid, but with social inclusion projects and housing. The actual methods employed by FEAD tend to vary from country to country, but in several EU states, such as Poland, its activities include helping to fund local food bank networks."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"In 2022 there were over 2,572 UK food banks in the UK.Professor Jon May, of Queen Mary University of London and the Independent Food Aid Network said statistics showed a rapid rise in several food banks during the last five years. ""There are now food banks in almost every community, from the East End of London to the Cotswolds. The spread of food banks maps growing problems of poverty across the UK, but also the growing drive among many thousands of people across the country to try and do something about those problems""."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"Though foodbanks were rarely seen in the UK in the second half of the twentieth century, their use has started to grow, especially in the 2000s, and have since dramatically expanded. The increase in the dependency on food banks has been blamed by some, such as Guardian columnist George Monbiot, on the 2008 recession and the Conservative government's austerity policies. These policies included cuts to the welfare state and caps on the total amount of welfare support that a family can claim."

 Europe , United Kingdom ,"have enough money to buy food that you or your family needed?' decreased from 9.8% in 2007 to 8.1% in 2012, with Spectator editor Toby Young speculating in 2015 that the initial rise was due to both more awareness of food banks, and Jobcentres referring people to food banks when they were hungry.Rachel Loopstra, lecturer on nutrition at King’s College London and food insecurity expert, said: “Recent national survey data suggests that 8% of adults experienced not having enough money for food over 2016 – this figure is likely to be many times more than the number helped by food banks."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"We need ongoing national survey monitoring to understand the scale of food insecurity, who is at risk, and the implications for child and adult health and wellbeing.” Those who are short of food are likely to frequently also be short of other essential products, like shampoo and basic hygiene products (e.g. soap, toilet rolls and sanitary products). Some people must choose between buying food and buying basic toiletries.As of January 2014, the largest group co-ordinating UK food banks was The Trussell Trust, a Christian charity based in Salisbury."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"About 43% of the UK's food banks were run by Trussell, about 20% by smaller church networks such as Besom and Basic, about 31% were independent, and about 4% were run by secular food bank networks such as Fare Share and Food Cycle.Before the 2008 credit crunch, food banks were ""almost unheard of"" in the UK. In 2004, Trussell only ran two food banks, but in 2022 the number had risen to over 1,400. In 2011, about one new food bank was being opened per week."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"In 2012, the Trussell Trust reported that the rate of new openings had increased to three per week. In August, the rate of new openings spiked to four per week, with three new food banks being opened in that month for Nottingham alone.Most UK food banks are hosted by churches in partnership with the wider community. They operate on the ""frontline"" model, giving out food directly to the hungry. Over 90% of the food given out is donated by the public, including schools, churches, businesses and individuals."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"The Trussell Trust had aimed to provide short-term support for people whose needs have not yet been addressed by official state welfare provision; those who had been ""falling into the cracks in the system"". The Trussell franchise has procedures which aim to prevent long-term dependency on their services and to ensure that those in need are referred to qualified outside agencies. The charity suggests that the credit crunch caused an upsurge in the number of people needing emergency food."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"Since 2010, demand for foodbanks continued to increase, and at a more rapid rate, partly as austerity began to take effect, and partly as those on low incomes began to draw down savings and run out of friends of whom they were willing to ask for help. Unlike soup kitchens, most, but not all UK food banks are unable to help people who come in off the street without a referral – instead, they operate with a referral system."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"Vouchers are handed out to those in need by various sorts of frontline care professionals, such as social workers, health visitors, Citizens Advice Bureaux, Jobcentres and housing officials. The voucher can typically be exchanged at the food bank for a package of food sufficient to last three days."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"The year to April 2013 saw close to 350,000 referrals to Trussell Trust foodbanks, more than double the amount from the previous year.Several food banks have been set up outside of the Trussell system, some faith-based, others secular, in part as they do not like having to turn away people without referrals, although Trussell Trust foodbanks do help clients in need without vouchers to get one as quickly as possible. There is also FareShare, a London-based charity which operates some nineteen depots on the American-style warehouse model."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"Rather than giving out food directly to individuals, FareShare distributes food to over 700 smaller agencies, mainly smaller independent operations like soup kitchens and breakfast clubs. Great emphasis is placed on reducing food waste as well as relieving food poverty. Fareshare operates on a business basis, employing several managers to oversee operations alongside their army of volunteers. Employee costs constituted over 50% of their expenditure in both 2011 and 2012.People who turn to food banks are typically grateful both for the food and for the warmth and kindness they receive from the volunteers."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"However, sometimes food banks have run out of supplies by the time they arrive. Some find it humiliating to have to ask for food, and the packages they receive do not always seem nutritious."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,Some food banks have tried to respond with innovative programs; London Street Foodbank for example began asking donors to send in supermarket vouchers so that those they serve will be able to choose food that best meets their nutritional needs.The Trussell Trust revealed a 47% increase in several three-day emergency supplies provided by their food banks in December 2016 compared to the monthly average for the 2016–17 financial year.
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"Public donations in December 2016 meant foodbanks met the increased need in that month, but donations in January, February and March 2017 all fell below the monthly average of 931 tonnes for the 2016-17 financial year. Although going for a few years by various small charities around the world, 2017 saw a significant increase in media coverage and take up of the reverse advent calendar. The UK Money bloggers campaign encouraging the public to give something to a food bank every day for 25 days was covered by The Mirror, The Guardian and others."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"Emma Revie of the Trussell Trust said, ""for too many people staying above water is a daily struggle"".Food bank use has increased since Universal Credit was implemented as part of the Welfare Reform Act 2012. Delays in providing the first payment force claimants to use food banks, also Universal Credit does not provide enough to cover basic living expenses. Claiming Universal Credit is complex and the system is hard to navigate, many claimants cannot afford internet access and cannot access online help with claiming."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"A report by the Trussell Trust says: ""Rather than acting as a service to ensure people do not face destitution, the evidence suggests that for people on the very lowest incomes … the poor functioning of universal credit can actually push people into a tide of bills, debts and, ultimately, lead them to a food bank. People are falling through the cracks in a system not made to hold them."
 Europe , United Kingdom ,"What little support available is primarily offered by the third sector, whose work is laudable, but cannot be a substitute for a real, nationwide safety net."" UK food banks appealed for volunteers and supplies, fearing an increase in demand for food as Universal Credit was rolled out further."
 Europe , UK food bank users ,"According to a May 2013 report by Oxfam and Church Action on Poverty, about half a million Britons had used food banks. The Trussell Trust reports that their food banks alone helped feed 346,992 people in 2012–13. Numbers using food banks more than doubled during the period 2012–13. ""Foodbanks help prevent crime, housing loss, family breakdown and mental health problems."" Reasons why people have difficulty getting enough to eat include redundancy, sickness, delays over receiving benefits, domestic violence, family breakdown, debt, and additional fuel costs in winter."
 Europe , UK food bank users ,Some clients of foodbanks are at work but cannot afford everything they need due to low pay.Close to half of those needing to use food banks have had issues with their benefit payments.
 Europe , UK food bank users ,Sanctioning

 Europe , UK food bank users ,was
 Europe , UK food bank users ,"the single most frequent reason for food bank referrals and there has been criticism over sanctions being imposed for allegedly spurious reasons.A joint report from the Trussell Trust, the Church of England, and the charities Oxfam and Child Poverty Action Group found that food bank users were more likely to live in rented accommodation, be single adults or lone parents, be unemployed, and have experienced a “sanction”, where their unemployment benefits were cut for at least one monthDelays in payment of housing benefit, disability benefit and other benefits and general bureaucratic issues with benefits can force people to use food banks."
 Europe , UK food bank users ,"Many further people who need food banks have low-income jobs but struggle to afford food after making debt repayments and all other expenses. Low-paid workers, part-time workers and those with zero-hour contracts are particularly vulnerable to financial crisis and sometimes need the assistance of food banks. As had been predicted, demand for food banks further increased after cuts to welfare came into effect in April 2013, which included the abolition of Crisis loans. In April 2014, Trussell reported that they had handed out 913,000 food parcels in the last year, up from 347,000 the year before."
 Europe , UK food bank users ,"Several councils have begun looking at funding food banks to increase their capability, as cuts to their budgets mean they will be less able to help vulnerable people directly.Sabine Goodwin, an Independent Food Aid Network researcher, said most food bank workers reported increasing demand for food aid. ""Many feel they are firefighting, finding a way to deal with the logistics of feeding more and more people, with no time to advocate for changes that would eradicate the need for food banks in the first place."""
 Europe , UK government ,"According to an all-party parliamentary report released in December 2014, key reasons for the increased demand for UK foodbanks are delays in paying benefits, welfare sanctions, and the recent reversal of the post-WWII trend for poor people's incomes to rise above or in line with increased costs for housing, utility bills and food.In 2013, the UK Government blocked a £22,000,000 European Union fund to help finance food banks in the UK. This disappointed Labour MEP, Richard Howitt, who assisted in negotiating the fund."
 Europe , UK government ,"Howitt stated: , sadly, our government is opposing this much-needed help for food banks on the basis that it is a national responsibility when in reality it has no intention of providing the help itself. The only conclusion is that Conservative anti-European ideology is being put before the needs of the most destitute and deprived in our society. Haroon Siddiqui said that the rise in food bank use coincided with the imposition of austerity and feels the government is reluctant to admit the obvious link."
 Europe , UK government ,"Siddiqui said that during the 2017 general election campaign, Conservative Prime Minister, Theresa May was asked about even nurses (then subject to a 1% annual pay freeze) using food banks and May merely reply, ""There are many complex reasons why people go to food banks."" Siddiqui wrote further, ""(...) the reasons people turn to food banks are quite plain (and there have been studies that support them). The Trussell Trust, the UK's biggest food bank network, has said that they help people with ""nowhere else to turn""."
 Europe , UK government ,"Earlier [in 2018] it said that food banks in areas where the full Universal Credit service had been in place for 12 months or more were four times as busy.Then-UK Prime Minister David Cameron said in the House of Commons in 2012 that he welcomed the efforts of food banks. Caroline Spelman, his Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, has described food banks as an ""excellent example"" of active citizenship."
 Europe , UK government ,"Labour MP Kate Green has a different view, feeling that the rise of food banks reflects people being let down by the state welfare system, saying: ""I feel a real burning anger about them ..."
 Europe , UK government ,"People are very distressed at having to ask for food; it's humiliating and distressing."" Cookery writer and poverty campaigner Jack Monroe wrote that those referred to food banks or given vouchers were ""the lucky ones with a good doctor or health visitor who knows us well enough to recognize that something has gone seriously wrong"" and expressed concern for those who lack this support.Food banks need extra donations during the summer holidays because school children do not receive free school meals during that time. The rising cost of living and the rollout of Universal Credit are also blamed."
 Europe , Germany ,"As of 2013, there were over 900 food banks in Germany, up from just 1 in 1993. In 2014, 1.5 million people a week used food banks in Germany."
 Europe , France ,"In total, around 3.5 million people rely on food banks in France. One provider, the Banque Alimentaire has over 100 branches in France, serving 200 a million meals a year to 1.85 million people. Several Asian places have begun to use food banks; these include Nepal, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan."
 Asia , India ,"Delhi Food Bank is an organization that feeds, empowers and transforms lives in the New Delhi–NCR Region. They hold that their shared capabilities can make the basic aspiration of universal access to food a reality. They attempt to pursue this vision through high quality and standards for processes leveraged by technology to get the right aid to the right people at the right time."
 Asia , Hong Kong ,"The first food bank in Hong Kong is Feeding Hong Kong, which was founded in 2009. Food Angel is also a food bank in Hong Kong. The Foodlink Foundation is also a food bank in Hong Kong."
 Asia , Japan ,"According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Japan, the number of such organizations stood at 178 in the FY2022 through March, marking a significant increase from the 120 seen two years earlier. As of 2022, there is at least one food bank organization in every prefecture in Japan. The importance of food banks has become more recognized during the Covid-19 pandemic."
 Asia , Japan ,"The Egyptian Food Bank was established in Cairo in 2006, and less than ten years later, food banks run on similar principles spread to other Arab countries in North Africa and the Middle East.In Sub-Saharan Africa, there are charity-run food banks that operate on a semi-commercial system that differs from both the more common ""warehouse"" and ""frontline"" models. In some rural LDCs such as Malawi, food is often relatively cheap and plentiful for the first few months after the harvest but then becomes more and more expensive."
 Asia , Japan ,"Food banks in those areas can buy large amounts of food shortly after the harvest, and then as food prices start to rise, they sell it back to local people throughout the year at well below market prices. Such food banks will sometimes also act as centres to provide smallholders and subsistence farmers with various forms of support.Formed in 2009, FoodBank South Africa (FoodBank SA) is South Africa's national food banking network and a member of The Global FoodBanking Network. FoodBank SA's vision is ""A South Africa without hunger and malnutrition"". Since the 1980s food banking has spread around the world."
 Asia , Japan ,"There are over 40 countries and regions with active food bank groups under the umbrella of The Global FoodBanking Network. Countries and regions in the international network include Australia, Israel, Turkey, Russia, India, Taiwan, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Guatemala, South Africa, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and the UK. There are also several countries with food banks which have not yet joined the network, either as they do not yet meet the required criteria or as they have not applied. Food banking and related models have been proposed as a key solution to the reduction greenhouse gas emissions."
 Asia , Japan ,"Around 8% of total emissions are due to food loss and waste. Through food rescue programs, food banks help reduce emissions by ensuring the productive use of energy involved in the production of food and by diverting food away from landfills, where it would have spoiled and generated methane and other greenhouse gasses. One estimate puts the greenhouse gas avoidance from food banks at more than 1.7 million tons in 2021. The rise of food banks has been 'broadly welcomed'."
 Asia , Japan ,"For it is said that, 'not only do they provide a solution to the problem of hunger that does not require resources from the state', but they can be viewed 'as evidence of increasing community spirit and of active, caring citizenship'. In the UK for example, Patrick Butler, society editor for The Guardian, has said that: ""Many politicians and campaigners are fascinated by the possibilties of food banks. After the initial shock that ""things have come to this"" there is, on the left of the political spectrum, a nervous excitement about the potential for community self-help."
 Asia , Japan ,"On the right, there is outright enthusiasm for what is seen as ""big society"" welfare in its purest form.""There has also been concern expressed about food banks by some researchers and politicians. Drawing on the United States's experience after the rapid rise of food banks in the 1980s, American sociology professor Janet Poppendieck warned that the rise of food banks can contribute to the long-term erosion of human rights and support for welfare systems. Once food banks become well established, it can be politically impossible to return responsibility for meeting the needs of hungry people to the state."
 Asia , Japan ,"Poppendieck says that the logistics of running food banks can be so demanding that they prevent kind-hearted people from having time to participate in public policy advocacy; yet she also says if they can be encouraged to lobby politicians for long-term changes that would help those on a low income, they often have considerable credibility with legislators."

 Definition ,,"Food loss and waste occurs at all stages of the food supply chain – production, processing, sales, and consumption. Definitions of what constitutes food loss versus food waste or what parts of foods (i.e., inedible parts) exit the food supply chain are considered lost or wasted vary. Terms are often defined on a situational basis (as is the case more generally with definitions of waste). Professional bodies, including international organizations, state governments, and secretariats may use their own definitions."
 Definition , United Nations ,"The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations defines food loss and waste as the decrease in quantity or quality of food along the food supply chain. Within this framework, UN Agencies distinguish loss and waste at two different stages in the process: Food loss occurs along the food supply chain from harvest/slaughter/catch up to, but not including, the sales level Food waste occurs at the retail and consumption level.Important components of this definition include: Food redirected to nonfood chains (including animal feed, compost, or recovery to bioenergy) is not counted as food loss or waste."
 Definition , United Nations ,"Inedible parts are not considered as food loss or waste (these inedible parts are sometimes referred to as unavoidable food waste)Under Sustainable Development Goal 12, the Food and Agriculture Organization is responsible for measuring food loss, while the UN Environmental Program measures food waste."
 Definition , European Union ,"In the European Union (EU), food waste is defined by combining the definitions of food and waste, namely: ""any substance or product, whether processed, partially processed or unprocessed, intended to be, or reasonably expected to be ingested by humans (...)"" (including things such as drinks and chewing gum; excluding things such as feed, medicine, cosmetics, tobacco products, and narcotic or psychotropic substances) ""which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard"".: 2–3 Previously, food waste was defined by directive 75/442/EEC as ""any food substance, raw or cooked, which is discarded, or intended or required to be discarded"" in 1975."
 Definition , European Union ,"In 2006, 75/442/EEC was repealed by 2006/12/EC, which defined waste as ""any substance or object in the categories set out in Annex I which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard""."

(2017) compared four definitions from:: 4 a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 2016 report: ""Food loss is defined as ‘the decrease in quantity or quality of food.’ Food waste is part of food loss and refers to discarding or alternative (nonfood) use of food that is safe and nutritious for human consumption along the entire food supply chain, from primary production to end household consumer level""; an Economic Research Service (ERS; a USDA agency) 2014 report: ""Food loss represents the amount of food postharvest, that is available for human consumption but is not consumed for any reason."

 Definition , Other definitions ,"Pre-consumer food generated during the manufacturing and packaging of food products is not included in EPA's food waste estimates.""According to Bellemare et al., the inclusion of food that goes to nonfood productive use is flawed for two reasons: ""First, if recovered food is used as an input, such as animal feed, fertilizer, or biomass to produce output, then by definition it is not wasted. However, there might be economic losses if the cost of recovered food is higher than the average cost of inputs in the alternative, nonfood use."
 Definition , Other definitions ,"Second, the definition creates practical problems for measuring food waste because the measurement requires tracking food loss in every stage of the supply chain and its proportion that flows to nonfood uses."": 4 They argued that only food that ends up in landfills should be counted as food waste, pointing to the 2016 EPA definition as a good example.: 4 Bellemare et al. also noted that ""the FAO and ERS definitions only apply to edible and safe and nutritious food, whereas the definitions of FUSIONS and the EPA apply to both edible and inedible parts of food."
 Definition , Other definitions ,"Finally, the ERS and EPA definitions of food waste exclude the food that is not harvested at the farm level."": 4 A 2019 FAO report stated: 'The notion of food being lost or wasted is deceptively simple, but in practice there is no commonly agreed definition of food loss and waste. FAO has worked towards the harmonization of concepts related to food loss and waste, and the definitions adopted in this report are the result of a consensus reached in consultation with experts in this field."
 Definition , Other definitions ,"This report understands food loss and waste as the decrease in quantity or quality of food along the food supply chain. Empirically it considers food losses as occurring along the food supply chain from harvest/slaughter/catch up to, but not including, the retail level. Food waste, on the other hand, occurs at the retail and consumption level. This definition also aligns with the distinction implicit in SDG Target 12.3. This report also asserts that, although there may be an economic loss, food diverted to other economic uses, such as animal feed, is not considered as quantitative food loss or waste."
 Definition , Other definitions ,"Similarly, inedible parts are not considered as food loss or waste.': 9–10"
 Definition , Methodology ,"The 2019 FAO report stated: ""Food loss and waste has typically been measured in physical terms using tonnes as reporting units. This measurement fails to account for the economic value of different commodities and can risk attributing a higher weight to low-value products just because they are heavier. [This] report acknowledges this by adopting a measure that accounts for the economic value of produce."": 10 Hall et al."
 Definition , Methodology ,"(2009) calculated food waste in the United States in terms of energy value ""by comparing the US food supply data with the calculated food consumed by the US population."" The result was that food waste among American consumers increased from ""about 30% of the available food supply in 1974 to almost 40% in recent years"" (the early 2000s), or about 900 kcal per person per day (1974) to about 1400 kcal per person per day (2003). A 2012 Natural Resources Defense Council report interpreted this to mean that Americans threw away up to 40% of food that was safe to eat."
 Definition , Methodology ,"Buzby & Hyman (2012) estimated both the total weight (in kg and lbs) and monetary value (in USD) of food loss in the United States, concluding that 'the annual value of food loss is almost 10% of the average amount spent on food per consumer in 2008'."
 Sources , Production ,"In the United States, food loss can occur at most stages of the food industry and in significant amounts. In subsistence agriculture, the amounts of food loss are unknown, but are likely to be insignificant by comparison, due to the limited stages at which loss can occur, and given that food is grown for projected need as opposed to a global marketplace demand."
 Sources , Production ,"Nevertheless, on-farm losses in storage in developing countries, particularly in African countries, can be high although the exact nature of such losses is much debated.In the food industry of the United States, the food supply of which is the most diverse and abundant of any country in the world, loss occurs from the beginning of food production chain. From planting, crops can be subjected to pest infestations and severe weather, which cause losses before harvest. Since natural forces (e.g. temperature and precipitation) remain the primary drivers of crop growth, losses from these can be experienced by all forms of outdoor agriculture."
 Sources , Production ,"On average, farms in the United States lose up to six billion pounds of crops every year because of these unpredictable conditions. According to the IPCC sixth assessment report, encouraging the development of technologies that address issues in food harvesting and post-harvesting could have a significant impact on decreasing food waste in the supply chain early-on.The use of machinery in harvesting can cause loss, as harvesters may be unable to discern between ripe and immature crops, or collect only part of a crop."
 Sources , Production ,"Economic factors, such as regulations and standards for quality and appearance, also cause food waste; farmers often harvest selectively, preferring to leave crops not to standard in the field (where they can be used as fertilizer or animal feed), since they would otherwise be discarded later. This method of removing undesirable produce from harvest collection, distribution sites and grocery stores is called culling. However, usually when culling occurs at the production, food processing, retail and consumption stages, it is to remove or dispose of produce with a strange or imperfect appearance rather than produce that is spoiled or unsafe to eat."
 Sources , Production ,"In urban areas, fruit and nut trees often go unharvested because people either do not realize that the fruit is edible or they fear that it is contaminated, despite research which shows that urban fruit is safe to consume."
 Sources , Food processing ,"Food loss continues in the post-harvest stage, but the amounts of post-harvest loss involved are relatively unknown and difficult to estimate.: 1 Regardless, the variety of factors that contribute to food loss, both biological/environmental and socio-economical, would limit the usefulness and reliability of general figures.: 1, 7–8 In storage, considerable quantitative losses can be attributed to pests and micro-organisms. This is a particular problem for countries that experience a combination of heat (around 30 °C) and ambient humidity (between 70 and 90 per cent), as such conditions encourage the reproduction of insect pests and micro-organisms."
 Sources , Food processing ,"Losses in the nutritional value, caloric value and edibility of crops, by extremes of temperature, humidity or the action of micro-organisms, also account for food waste. Further losses are generated in the handling of food and by shrinkage in weight or volume.Some of the food loss produced by processing can be difficult to reduce without affecting the quality of the finished product.: 3 Food safety regulations are able to claim foods that contradict standards before they reach markets."
 Sources , Food processing ,"Although this can conflict with efforts to reuse food loss (such as in animal feed), safety regulations are in place to ensure the health of the consumer; they are vitally important, especially in the processing of foodstuffs of animal origin (e.g. meat and dairy products), as contaminated products from these sources can lead to and are associated with microbiological and chemical hazards."
 Sources , Retail ,"Packaging protects food from damage during its transportation from farms and factories via warehouses to retailing, as well as preserving its freshness upon arrival. Although it avoids considerable food waste, packaging can compromise efforts to reduce food waste in other ways, such as by contaminating waste that could be used for animal feedstocks with plastics.In 2013, the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) performed research that suggests that the leading cause of food waste in America is due to uncertainty over food expiration dates, such as confusion in deciphering best-before, sell-by, or use-by dates."
 Sources , Retail ,"Joined by Harvard's Food Law and Policy Clinic, the NRDC produced a study called The Dating Game: How Confusing Food Date Labels Leads to Food Waste in America. This United States-based study looked at the intertwining laws which lead labeling to end up unclear and erratic. This uncertainty leads to consumers to toss food, most often because they think the food may be unsafe or misunderstand the labeling on the food completely. Lack of regulation on labeling can result in large quantities of food being removed from the market overall.Retail stores throw away large quantities of food."
 Sources , Retail ,"Usually, this consists of items that have reached either their best-before, sell-by, or use-by dates. Some stores make an effort to markdown these goods with systems like discount stickers, stores have widely varying policies to handle the excess food. Much of the food discarded by stores is still edible. Some stores put effort into preventing access to poor or homeless people, while others work with charitable organization to distribute food. Retailers also contribute to waste as a result of their contractual arrangements with suppliers. Failure to supply agreed quantities renders farmers or processors liable to have their contracts cancelled."
 Sources , Retail ,"As a consequence, they plan to produce more than actually required to meet the contract, to have a margin of error. Surplus production is often simply disposed of.Retailers usually have strict cosmetic standards for produce, and if fruits or vegetables are misshapen or superficially bruised, they are often not put on the shelf. In the United States, some of the estimated six billion pounds of produce wasted each year are discarded because of appearance. The USDA publishes guidelines used as a baseline assessment by produce distributors, grocery stores, restaurants and other consumers in order to rate the quality of food."
 Sources , Retail ,"These guidelines and how they rate are readily available on their website. For example, apples get graded by their size, color, wax residue, firmness, and skin appearance. If apples rank highly in these categories and show close to no superficial defects, they are rated as ""U.S. Extra Fancy"" or ""U.S. Fancy"", these are the typical ratings sought out by grocery stores when purchasing their produce. Any apples with suboptimal levels of appearance are ranked as either ""U.S. Number 1"" or ""Utility"" and are not normally purchased for retail, as recommended by produce marketing sources, despite being safe and edible."
 Sources , Retail ,"A number of regional programs and organizations have been established by the EPA and USDA in an attempt to reduce such produce waste. Organizations in other countries, such as Good & Fugly in Australia and No Food Waste in India, are making similar efforts worldwide."
 Sources , Retail ,"The popular trend of selling ""imperfect"" produce at retail has been criticized for overlooking existing markets for these foods (eg the food processing industry and bargain grocery stores) and downplaying the household-level wasting of food that is statistically a larger part of the overall problem.The fishing industry wastes substantial amounts of food: about 40–60% of fish caught in Europe is discarded as the wrong size or wrong species. This comes to about 2.3 million tonnes per annum in the North Atlantic and the North Sea."
 Sources , Food-service industry ,"Addressing food waste requires involving multiple stakeholders throughout the food supply chain, which is a market-driven system. Each stakeholder and their food waste quantification can be dependent on geographical scales. This geographical scale then results in the production of different definitions of food waste, as mentioned earlier, with respect to the complexities of food supply chains and then create a narrative that further shows the needs for specific research on important stakeholders. The food service industry suggests to be a key stakeholder to achieve mitigation."
 Sources , Food-service industry ,"The key players within the food service industry include the manufacturers, producers, farmers, managers, employees, and consumers. The key factors relating to food waste in restaurants include the food menu, the production procedure, the use of pre-prepared versus whole food products, dinnerware size, type of ingredients used, the dishes served, opening hours, and disposal methods."
 Sources , Food-service industry ,"These factors then can be categorized in the different stages of operations that relate to pre-kitchen, kitchen-based, and post-kitchen processes.In restaurants in developing countries, the lack of infrastructure and associated technical and managerial skills in food production have been identified as the key drivers in the creation of food waste currently and in the future. Comparatively, the majority of food waste in developed countries tends to be produced post-consumer, which is driven by the low prices of food, greater disposable income, consumers' high expectations of food cosmetic standards, and the increasing disconnect between consumers and how food is being produced (Urbanization)."
 Sources , Food-service industry ,"That being said, in United States restaurants alone, an estimated 22 to 33 billion pounds are wasted each year.Serving plate size reduction has been identified as an intervention effective at reducing restaurant food waste. Under such interventions, restaurants decrease the size of plates for meals provided to diners. Similar interventions which have been found to be effective at reducing restaurant food waste include utilizing reusable rather than disposable plates and decreasing serving size."
 Sources , Consumption ,"Consumers are directly and indirectly responsible for wasting a lot of food, which could for a large part be avoided if they were willing to accept suboptimal food (SOF) that deviates in sensory characteristics (odd shapes, discolorations) or has a best-before date that is approaching or has passed, but is still perfectly fine to eat. In addition to inedible and edible food waste generated by consumers, substantial amounts of food is wasted through food overconsumption, also referred to as metabolic food waste, estimated globally as 10% of foods reaching the consumer."
 Extent , Global extent ,"Efforts are underway by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to measure progress towards SDG Target 12.3 through two separate indices: the Food Loss Index (FLI) and the Food Waste Index (FWI).According to FAO's The State of Food and Agriculture 2019, globally, in 2016, around 14 percent of the world's food is lost from production before reaching the retail level. Generally, levels of loss are higher for fruits and vegetables than for cereals and pulses."
 Extent , Global extent ,"However, even for the latter, significant levels are found in sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, while they are limited in Central and Southern Asia.Estimates from UN Environment's Food Waste Index suggest that about 931 million tonnes of food, or 17 percent of total food available to consumers in 2019, went into the waste bins of households, retailers, restaurants and other food services.According to a report from Feedback EU, the EU wastes 153 million tonnes of food each year, around double previous estimates."
 Extent , Earlier estimates ,"In 2011, an FAO publication based on studies carried out by The Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology (SIK) found that the total of global amount of food loss and waste was around one third of the edible parts of food produced for human consumption, amounting to about 1.3 billion tonnes (1.28×109 long tons; 1.43×109 short tons) per year.: 4 As the following table shows, industrialized and developing countries differ substantially. In developing countries, it is estimated that 400–500 calories per day per person are wasted, while in developed countries 1,500 calories per day per person are wasted."
 Extent , Earlier estimates ,"In the former, more than 40% of losses occur at the post-harvest and processing stages, while in the latter, more than 40% of losses occur at the retail and consumer levels."
 Extent , Earlier estimates ,"The total food waste by consumers in industrialized countries (222 million tonnes or 218,000,000 long tons or 245,000,000 short tons) is almost equal to the entire food production in sub-Saharan Africa (230 million tonnes or 226,000,000 long tons or 254,000,000 short tons).: 4 A 2013 report from the British Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IME) likewise estimated that 30–50% (or 1.2–2 billion tonnes or 1.18×109–1.97×109 long tons or 1.32×109–2.20×109 short tons ) of all food produced remains uneaten."
 Extent , Australia ,"Each year in New South Wales, more than 25 million meals are delivered by charity OzHarvest from food that would otherwise be wasted. Each year, the Australian economy loses $20 billion in food waste. This has a crucial environmental impact through the waste of resources used to produce, manufacture, package, and distribute that food.In addition, it is estimated that 7.6 million tonnes of CO2 is generated by the disposed food in landfills. It is also the cause of odour, leaching, and potential generation for diseases."
 Extent , Australia ,"In March 2019, the Australian ministry of the environment shared the key findings of Australia's National food waste baseline, which will facilitate the tracking of the progress towards their goal to halve Australian food waste by 2030.Many initiatives were taken by the Australian government in order to help achieve this goal. In fact, they financed $1.2 million in organization that invest in renewable energies systems to store and transport food. They also funded more than $10 million for research on food waste reduction."
 Extent , Australia ,"Local governments have also implemented programs such as information sessions on storing food and composting, diversion of waste from restaurants and cafes from landfills to shared recycling facilities and donation of food to organization that would otherwise be wasted."
 Extent , Canada ,"In Canada, 58% of all food is wasted, amounting to 35.5 million tonnes of food per annuum. The value of this lost food is equivalent to CA$21 billion. Such quantities of food would be enough to feed all Canadians for five months. It is estimated that about one third of this waste could be spared and sent to those in need. There are many factors that contribute to such large-scale waste. Manufacturing and processing food alone incur costs of CA$21 billion, or 4.82 million tons. Per household, it is estimated that $1,766 is lost in food loss and waste."
 Extent , Canada ,"The Government of Canada identifies three main factors contributing to household waste: (1) buying too much food and not eating it before it spoils, (2) malfunctioning or poorly-designed packaging that does not deter spoilage rates or contamination, and (3) improper disposing of food – using garbage bins instead of those intended for organic waste."
 Extent , Canada ,"Canada, Mexico, and the United States are working together under the Commission for Environmental Cooperation in order to address the severe problem of food waste in North America.Canada specifically is working in the following ways to reduce food waste: Canada pledged to consult on strategies in the Strategy on Short-lived Climate Pollutants to reduce avoidable food waste within the country. This will help to reduce methane emissions from Canadian landfills. The government has implemented a Food Policy for Canada, which is a movement towards a more sustainable food system."
 Extent , Canada ,"In February 2019, the government brought together several experts from different sectors to share ideas and discuss opportunities for measuring and reducing food loss and waste across the food supply chain.During the 2022 Quebec general election, Québec solidaire party spokesman Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois stated that ending food waste in Quebec would be a priority of the party if in government. The party seeks to cut food waste by 50% by mandating large businesses and institutions to give unsold food to groups that would distribute the food, or to businesses that would process the food."
 Extent , China ,"In 2015 the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported that in big cities there was 17 to 18 million tons of food waste, enough to feed over 30 million people. About 25% of the waste was staple foods and about 18% meat.In August 2020 the Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping said the amount of food waste was shocking and distressing."
 Extent , China ,"A local authority campaign ""Operation empty plate"" (Chinese: 光盘行动) was started to reduce waste, including encouraging food outlets to limit orders to one fewer main dish than the number of customers.As of December 2020, a draft law is under consideration to penalise food outlets if they encourage or mislead customers to order excessive meals causing obvious waste, first with a warning and then fines of up to 10,000 yuan. It would allow restaurants to charge customers who leave excessive leftovers. Broadcasters who promote overeating or food waste could also be fined up to 100,000 yuan."
 Extent , Denmark ,"According to Ministry of Environment (Denmark), over 700,000 tonnes per year of food is wasted every year in Denmark in the entire food value chain from farm to fork. Due to the work of activist Selina Juul's Stop Wasting Food movement, Denmark has achieved a national reduction in food waste by 25% in 5 years (2010–2015)."
 Extent , France ,"In France, approximately 1.3–1.9 million tonnes of food waste is produced every year, or between 20 and 30 kilograms per person per year. Out of the 10 million tonnes of food that is either lost or wasted in the country, 7.1 million tonnes of food wasted in the country, only 11% comes from supermarkets. Not only does this cost the French €16 billion per year, but also the negative impact on the environment is also shocking. In France, food waste emits 15.3 million tonnes of CO2, which represents 3% of the country's total CO2 emission."
 Extent , France ,"In response to this issue, in 2016, France became the first country in the world to pass a unanimous legislation that bans supermarkets from throwing away or destroying unsold food. Instead, supermarkets are expected to donate such food to charities and food banks. In addition to donating food, many businesses claim to prevent food waste by selling soon-to-be wasted products at discounted prices. The National Pact Against Food Waste in France has outlined eleven measures to achieve a food waste reduction by half by 2025."
 Extent , Hungary ,"According to the research of National Food Chain Safety Office in 2019 based on the official EU methodological framework, an average Hungarian consumer generates 68 kg food waste annually. 49% of this amount would be avoidable. The research team (Wasteless project) replicated the study in 2019 involving 165 households. According to the data, food waste generated by the Hungarian households was estimated to be 65.5 kg per capita annually. Between the two periods, a 4% decrease was observed, despite significant economic expansion. In 2021, The Fidesz government of Viktor Orbán passed a law dealing with food waste."
 Extent , Italy ,"According to REDUCE project, which produced the first baseline dataset for Italy based on official EU methodological framework, food waste is 530 g per person per week at household stage (only edible fraction); food waste in school canteens corresponds to 586 g per pupil per week; retail food waste per capita, per year corresponds to 2.9 kg.

 Extent , New Zealand ,Research done on household food waste in New Zealand found that larger households and households with more young people created more food waste. The average household in this case study put 40% of food waste into the rubbish.
 Extent , Singapore ,"In Singapore, 788,600 tonnes (776,100 long tons; 869,300 short tons) of food was wasted in 2014. Of that, 101,400 tonnes (99,800 long tons; 111,800 short tons) were recycled. Since Singapore has limited agriculture ability, the country spent about S$14.8 billion (US$10.6 billion) on importing food in 2014. US$1.4 billion of it ends up being wasted, or 13 percent.On January 1, 2020, Singapore implemented the Zero Waste Masterplan which aims to reduce Singapore's daily waste production by 30 percent. The project also aims to extend the lifespan of the Semaku Landfill, Singapore's only landfill, beyond 2025."
 Extent , Singapore ,"As a direct result of the project, food waste dropped to 665,000 tonnes, showing a significant decrease from 2017's all-time high of 810,000 tonnes."
 Extent , United Kingdom ,"In the UK, 6,700,000 tonnes (6,590,000 long tons; 7,390,000 short tons) per year of wasted food (purchased and edible food which is discarded) amounts to a cost of £10.2 billion each year. This represents costs of £250 to £400 a year per household."
 Extent , United States ,"Estimates of food waste in the United States range from 35 million tons to 103 million tons. In a study done by National Geographic in 2014, Elizabeth Royte indicated more than 30 percent of food in the United States, valued at $162 billion annually, is not eaten. The University of Arizona conducted a study in 2004 that indicated that 14% to 15% of United States edible food is untouched or unopened, amounting to $43 billion worth of discarded, but edible, food."
 Extent , United States ,"In 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture came forth with estimations from the Economic Research Service that approximates food waste in the United States to be equivalent to 141 trillion calories.USDA data from 2010 shows that 26% of fish, meat, and poultry were thrown away at the retail and consumer level. Since then, meat production has increased by more than 10%. Data scientist Harish Sethu says this means that billions of animals are raised and slaughtered only to end up in a landfill."
 Extent , United States ,"Empirical evidence at the global level on the environmental footprints for major commodity groups suggests that, if the aim is to reduce land use, the primary focus should be on meat and animal products, which account for 60 percent of the land footprint associated with food loss and waste. If the aim is to target water scarcity, cereals and pulses make the largest contribution (more than 70 percent), followed by fruits and vegetables."
 Extent , United States ,"In terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with food loss and waste, the biggest contribution is again from cereals and pulses (more than 60 percent), followed by roots, tubers and oil-bearing crops. However, the environmental footprint for different commodities also varies across regions and countries, due, among other things, to differences in crop yields and production techniques. According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, the reduction of food waste would be beneficial for improving availability of resources such as ""water, land-use, energy consumption"" and the overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere."
 Extent , United States ,"In 2022 United Nations Biodiversity Conference nations adopted an agreement for preserving biodiversity, including a commitment to reduce food waste by 50% by the year 2030.According to FAO's The State of Food and Agriculture 2019, the case for reducing food loss and waste includes gains that society can reap but which individual actors may not take into account, namely: (i) increased productivity and economic growth; (ii) improved food security and nutrition; and (iii) mitigation of environmental impacts of losing and wasting food, in particular terms of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG emissions as well as lowering pressure on land and water resources."
 Extent , United States ,"The last two societal gains, in particular, are typically seen as externalities of reducing food loss and waste.Response to the problem of food waste at all social levels has varied hugely, including campaigns from advisory and environmental groups, and concentrated media attention on the subject.As suggested by the food waste hierarchy, prevention and reuse pathways for human consumption have the highest priority levels for food waste treatment. The general approach to food waste reduction comprise two main pathways: prevention and valorisation."
 Extent , United States ,"Prevention of food waste infers all actions that reduce food production and ultimately prevent food from being produced in vain, such as food donations or re-processing into new food products. Valorisation on the other hand comprise actions that recover the materials, nutrients or energy in food waste, for instance by producing animal feed, fuel or energy. Multiple studies have studied the environmental benefits of food waste prevention measures, including food donations, recovery of unharvested vegetables for re-use in food production, re-processing of surplus bread for beer production, and producing chutney or juice from leftovers."
 Extent , United States ,"Food waste can also be used to produce multiple high-value products, such as a fish oil substitute for food or feed use via marine micro algae, without compromising the ability to produce energy via biogas. The general consensus currently suggest that reducing food waste by either prevention or valorisation, for human consumption, infers higher environmental benefits compared to the lower priority levels, such as energy production or disposal."
 Extent , United States ,"Multiple private enterprises have developed hardware and software solutions dealing mainly with the prevention of food waste within foodservice production facilities (contract catering, hotels & resorts, cruise ships, casinos etc.), by gathering quantitative and qualitative data about the specific food waste, helping chefs and managers reduce food waste by up to 70% by improving and optimising their workflows and menus."
 Prevention and valorisation , Food rescue ,"There are multiple initiatives that rescue food that would otherwise not be consumed by humans anymore. The food can come from supermarkets, restaurants or private households for example. Such initiatives are: food banks, online platforms like Too Good To Go and Olio, public foodsharing shelves like those from foodsharing.de and dumpster diving."
 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"One way of dealing with food waste is to reduce its creation. Consumers can reduce spoilage by planning their food shopping, avoiding potentially wasteful spontaneous purchases, and storing foods properly (and also preventing a too large buildup of perishable stock). Widespread educational campaigns have been shown to be an effective way to reduce food waste.A British campaign called ""Love Food, Hate Waste"" has raised awareness about preventative measures to address food waste for consumers."

 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"storage and preparation and in-store education, the UK observed a 21% decrease in avoidable household food waste over the course of 5 years.Another potential solution is for ""smart packaging"" which would indicate when food is spoiled more precisely than expiration dates currently do, for example with temperature-sensitive ink, plastic that changes color when exposed to oxygen, or gels that change color with time.An initiative in Curitiba, Brazil called Cambio Verde allows farmers to provide surplus produce (produce they would otherwise discard due to too low prices) to people that bring glass and metal to recycling facilities (to encourage further waste reduction)."
 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"In Europe, the Food Surplus Entrepreneurs Network (FSE Network), coordinates a network of social businesses and nonprofit initiatives with the goal to spread best practices to increase the use of surplus food and reduction of food waste.An overarching consensus exists on the substantial environmental benefits of food waste reduction. However, rebound effects may cause substitutive consumption as a result of economic savings made from food waste prevention, potentially offsetting more than half of the avoided emissions (depending on the type of food and price elasticities involved)."
 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"In areas where the waste collection is a public function, food waste is usually managed by the same governmental organization as other waste collection. Most food waste is combined with general waste at the source. Separate collections, also known as source-separated organics, have the advantage that food waste can be disposed of in ways not applicable to other wastes. In the United States, companies find higher and better uses for large commercial generators of food and beverage waste."
 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"From the end of the 19th century through the middle of the 20th century, many municipalities collected food waste (called ""garbage"" as opposed to ""trash"") separately. This was typically disinfected by steaming and fed to pigs, either on private farms or in municipal piggeries.Separate curbside collection of food waste is now being revived in some areas."
 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"To keep collection costs down and raise the rate of food waste segregation, some local authorities, especially in Europe, have introduced ""alternate weekly collections"" of biodegradable waste (including, e.g., garden waste), which enable a wider range of recyclable materials to be collected at reasonable cost, and improve their collection rates. However, they result in a two-week wait before the waste will be collected. The criticism is that particularly during hot weather, food waste rots and stinks, and attracts vermin. Waste container design is therefore essential to making such operations feasible."
 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"Curbside collection of food waste is also done in the U.S., some ways by combining food scraps and yard waste together. Several states in the U.S. have introduced a yard waste ban, not accepting leaves, brush, trimmings, etc. in landfills. Collection of food scraps and yard waste combined is then recycled and composted for reuse. As alternatives to landfill, food waste can be composted to produce soil and fertilizer, fed to animals or insects, or used to produce energy or fuel. Some wasted fruit parts, can also be biorefined to extract useful substances for the industry (i.e."
 Prevention and valorisation , Consumer marketing ,"succinic acid from orange peels, lycopene from tomato peels)."
 Disposal , Landfills and greenhouse gases ,"Dumping food waste in a landfill causes odour as it decomposes, attracts flies and vermin, and has the potential to add biological oxygen demand (BOD) to the leachate. The European Union Landfill Directive and Waste Regulations, like regulations in other countries, enjoin diverting organic wastes away from landfill disposal for these reasons."
 Disposal , Landfills and greenhouse gases ,"Starting in 2015, organic waste from New York City restaurants will be banned from landfills.In countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, food scraps constitute around 19% of the waste buried in landfills, where it biodegrades very easily and produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.Methane, or CH4, is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas that is released into the air, also produced by landfills in the U.S. Although methane spends less time in the atmosphere (12 years) than CO2, it's more efficient at trapping radiation."
 Disposal , Landfills and greenhouse gases ,It is 25 times greater to impact climate change than CO2 in a 100-year period. Humans accounts over 60% of methane emissions globally.
 Disposal , Fodder and insect feed ,"Large quantities of fish, meat, dairy and grain are discarded at a global scale annually, when they can be used for things other than human consumption. The feeding of food scraps or slop to domesticated animals such as pigs or chickens is, historically, the most common way of dealing with household food waste. The animals turn roughly two thirds of their ingested food into gas or fecal waste, while the last third is digested and repurposed as meat or dairy products. There are also different ways of growing produce and feeding livestock that could ultimately reduce waste."
 Disposal , Fodder and insect feed ,"Bread and other cereal products discarded from the human food chain could be used to feed chickens. Chickens have traditionally been given mixtures of waste grains and milling by-products in a mixture called chicken scratch. As well, giving table scraps to backyard chickens is a large part of that movement's claim to sustainability, though not all backyard chicken growers recommend it. Ruminants and pigs have also been fed bakery waste for a long time.Certain food waste (such as flesh) can also be used as feed in maggot farming. The maggots can then be fed to other animals."
 Disposal , Fodder and insect feed ,"In China, some food waste is being processed by feeding it to cockroaches."
 Disposal , Composting ,"Food waste can be biodegraded by composting, and reused to fertilize soil. Composting is the aerobic process completed by microorganisms in which the bacteria break down the food waste into simpler organic materials that can then be used in soil. By redistributing nutrients and high microbial populations, compost reduces water runoff and soil erosion by enhancing rainfall penetration, which has been shown to reduce the loss of sediment, nutrients, and pesticide losses to streams by 75–95%.Composting food waste leads to a decrease in the quantity of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere."
 Disposal , Composting ,"In landfills, organic food waste decomposes anaerobically, producing methane gas that is emitted into the atmosphere. When this biodegradable waste is composted, it decomposes aerobically and does not produce methane, but instead produces organic compost that can then be utilized in agriculture. Recently, the city of New York has begun to require that restaurants and food-producing companies begin to compost their leftover food."
 Disposal , Composting ,"Another instance of composting progress is a Wisconsin-based company called WasteCap, who is dedicated towards aiding local communities create composting plans.Municipal Food Waste (MFW) can be composted to create this product of organic fertilizer, and many municipalities choose to do this citing environmental protection and economic efficiency as reasoning. Transporting and dumping waste in landfills requires both money and room in the landfills that have very limited available space."
 Disposal , Composting ,"One municipality who chose to regulate MFW is San Francisco, who requires citizens to separate compost from trash on their own, instituting fines for non-compliance at $100 for individual homes and $500 for businesses. The city's economic reasoning for this controversial mandate is supported by their estimate that one business can save up to $30000 annually on garbage disposal costs with the implementation of the required composting."
 Disposal , Home composting ,"Composting is an economical and environmentally conscious step many homeowners could take to reduce their impact on landfill waste. Instead of food scraps and spoiled food taking up space in trashcans or stinking up the kitchen before the bag is full, it could be put outside and broken down by worms and added to garden beds."
 Disposal , Anaerobic digestion ,"Anaerobic digestion produces both useful gaseous products and a solid fibrous ""compostable"" material. Anaerobic digestion plants can provide energy from waste by burning the methane created from food and other organic wastes to generate electricity, defraying the plants' costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency states that the use of anaerobic composting allows for large amounts of food waste to avoid the landfills."
 Disposal , Anaerobic digestion ,"Instead of producing these greenhouse gasses into the environment from being in a landfill, the gasses can alternatively be harnessed in these facilities for reuse.Since this process of composting produces high volumes of biogas, there are potential safety issues such as explosion and poisoning. These interactions require proper maintenance and personal protective equipment is utilized. Certain U.S. states, such as Oregon, have implemented the requirement for permits on such facilities, based on the potential danger to the population and surrounding environment.Food waste coming through the sanitary sewers from garbage disposal units is treated along with other sewage and contributes to sludge."
 Disposal , Commercial liquid food waste ,"Commercially, food waste in the form of wastewater coming from commercial kitchens' sinks, dishwashers and floor drains is collected in holding tanks called grease interceptors to minimize flow to the sewer system. This often foul-smelling waste contains both organic and inorganic waste (chemical cleaners, etc.) and may also contain hazardous hydrogen sulfide gases. It is referred to as fats, oils, and grease (FOG) waste or more commonly ""brown grease"" (versus ""yellow grease"", which is fryer oil that is easily collected and processed into biodiesel) and is an overwhelming problem, especially in the US, for the aging sewer systems."
 Disposal , Commercial liquid food waste ,"Per the US EPA, sanitary sewer overflows also occur due to the improper discharge of FOGs to the collection system. Overflows discharge 3–10 billion U.S. gallons (11–38 million cubic meters) of untreated wastewater annually into local waterways, and up to 3,700 illnesses annually are due to exposure to contamination from sanitary sewer overflows into recreational waters.

 Objectives ,,"Food Angel claims to have the goals of reducing food waste at source, alleviating hunger, relieving poverty, and educating the next generation. The idea of Food Angel originated from the pressure on landfills in Hong Kong. When the organization started to grow, it began addressing other food-related social problems, such as poverty. Food Angel works with 150 partners, including celebrity partners. It hopes that by large scale promotion, it can raise citizens’ attention to food wastage and the importance of food waste recycling."
 Objectives ,,"The goal of the organization is to minimize food waste and to encourage volunteers to give a hand to people in need. Food Angel's vision is to reduce food waste and ensure everyone in Hong Kong is fed three meals a day. Food Angel rescues surplus food to relieve the landfill pressure in Hong Kong. The organisation collects surplus food from suppliers, supermarket, wet markets, and donation partners."
 Objectives ,,"It receives food donations, including fresh food, canned/non-perishable food, oils and seasoning, cooked foods, and frozen/chilled foods, to prepare meal boxes to then distribute to people in need.Besides distributing meal boxes at the center, Food Angel also visits the elderly and delivers meal boxes to those who are disabled. It also provides elderly care workshops like literacy classes, Chinese opera, and Erhu performances. It receives support from more than 60 companies and organizations."
 Services , Corporate Angel ,"Corporate Angel support Food Angel's campaign ""Waste Not, Hunger Not"". It organizes internal fundraising events to raise money for Food Angel's program."
 Services , Green Angel ,"Green Angel teaches children to cherish food and preserve the natural resources on Earth. The program offers school-based educational activities over an academic year, including introductory talks, puppet shows, animations, green lessons, food upcycling workshops, field trips, inter-school competitions, and a rewards system."
 Services , Outreach Angel ,"Outreach Angel delivers free and nutritious hot meals in boxes and non-perishable food packs, and provides loving care to singletons and deprived elderly living in the Eastern District. Outreach Angel provides home delivery service and regular home visits to the single, physically frail, or disabled elderly five days a week."
 Services , Community Angel ,"Community Angel provides free dine-in food assistance service in the Sham Shui Po District for the vulnerable and frail elderly who are aged 65 or above. Food Angel was founded in 2011 and has started several campaigns since. News about Food Angel's activities has been in the media since 2012. For example, there was wide media coverage about the plan to give lunch boxes to the people in need by using food waste, which was introduced in 2015. The three events of Construction Hong Kong appeared in newspapers, such as Apple Daily, Oriental Daily, and Skypost."
 Background and principles ,,"Food Not Bombs is an all-volunteer global movement sharing free vegan meals as a protest against war and poverty. Each chapter collects surplus food from grocery stores, bakeries, and that would otherwise go to waste and occasionally collects items from garbage dumpsters when stores are uncooperative. FNB also accepts donations from local farmers, then prepares free community meals which are offered to anyone who is hungry. According to FNB, the group's central beliefs are: Meals are always vegan or vegetarian. Meals are free to anyone. Each chapter is independent and autonomous and makes decisions via consensus. Dedication to nonviolence."
 Background and principles ,,"Views ""food as a right not a privilege.""Coinciding with these beliefs, the groups' goals are: To combat poverty and homelessness To facilitate community gatherings of hungry people To allow anyone to volunteer to help cook, and then eat."
 Activity , 1980s ,"Food Not Bombs was founded in 1980 in Cambridge, Massachusetts by anti-nuclear activists Keith McHenry, Jo Swanson, Mira Brown, Susan Eaton, Brian Feigenbaum, C.T. Lawrence Butler, Jessie Constable and Amy Rothstien. According to Keith McHenry, the name came about when he discovered that they were distributing food to the poor just across the street from a new building development for Draper Labs where, rumor had it, they were designing nuclear weapons. McHenry says that it made the group realize that ""there are hungry people on one side of the street."
 Activity , 1980s ,"There are people on the other that are making money making nuclear weapons. We should be called 'Food Not Bombs.'"" Co-founder, Keith McHenry has volunteered for 35 years and can be found sharing food almost every week in various cities including Santa Cruz, California and Taos, New Mexico. The members' activities included providing food, marching, and protesting. They protested such things as nuclear power, United States' involvement in the Salvadoran Civil War, and discrimination against the homeless.The first arrests for sharing free food (aka 'sharing') occurred on August 15, 1988 at the entrance to Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California."
 Activity , 1980s ,"Nine people were arrested that day, including McHenry. The city made over 1,000 arrests, and Amnesty International declared these volunteers 'prisoners of conscience'."
 Activity , 2000s ,"In the summer of 2007, the Fort Lauderdale, FL FNB chapter began receiving systematic harassment from local law enforcement culminating in an ultimatum presented by the Fort Lauderdale police. The police demanded the arrest of volunteers responsible for the public 'sharings'. The following week, hundreds of supporters for FNB managed to compel local law enforcement to relent, which lasted until the 2010s.The city of Orlando, FL enacted an ordinance prohibiting the serving of food to more than a specified number[how many?] of people without a permit."
 Activity , 2000s ,"In the fall of 2007, Eric Montanez of Orlando's FNB was charged with violating Orlando's city ordinance. On October 10, 2007, Montanez was acquitted by a jury of the charge. FNB along with a church for the homeless (First Vagabonds Church of God) sued the city on the grounds that their food service is covered under the first amendment as a part of protected political speech and religious activity. The groups won the lawsuit and the city ordinance was overturned. The city of Orlando appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and subsequently won."
 Activity , 2000s ,"On August 31, 2010, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the decision, barring Orlando from enforcing the ordinance until another hearing before a 10-judge panel could take place.In May 2008, local business owners attempted to stop the Kitchener, Ontario, FNB group from serving meals in a highly-visible downtown location, describing the group as ""supporting meat-free diets, anti-capitalism, and an end to Canada's military intervention in Afghanistan.""In April 2009, the city of Middletown, Connecticut, issued a cease-and-desist order to the local chapter of FNB."
 Activity , 2000s ,"Prior to the order, the city health inspector cited the organization for distributing food without a license. In August 2009, the chapter began operating through a licensed kitchen provided by the Middletown First Church of Christ Congregational as state hearings into the matter were held. The most widely publicized restrictions on food sharing involving FNB were the 2011 feeding bans in Florida. Similar laws have been enacted in other jurisdictions, including Philadelphia and Houston."
 Activity , 2010s ,"On April 20, 2011, an en banc panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Orlando ordinance as a valid ""time, place and manner"" regulation, reversing the initial ruling of First Vagabonds Church of God, An Unincorporated Association, Brian Nichols v. City of Orlando, Florida and removing the permanent injunction against the Orlando ordinance that was first attempted in 2007."
 Activity , 2010s ,"The lawyer for Orlando FNB issued a cease and desist order to the city, saying that violating the ordinance was not an arrestable offense, and hackers claiming to be affiliated with Anonymous began issuing threats to the city of Orlando. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer received heavy criticism for referring to Food Not Bombs activists as ""food terrorists.""On June 20, Ben Markeson was cited for holding a sign without a permit, and hackers carried through with their threats and took down the Orlando Chamber of Commerce site and a Universal Studios website in ""Operation Orlando""."
 Activity , 2010s ,"On June 22, more arrests took place including a second arrest of McHenry. On July 1, after national and international attention and further hacks, OFNB accepted the Mayor's suggestion to move sharings to City Hall, which stopped arrests and resulted in a new, stable arrangement for Orlando's FNB.Homeless hacktivist Christopher Doyon, also known as ""Commander X"", was eventually arrested for ""Operation Orlando"" and other activity. Soon after his arraignment he held a press statement where he admitted to all charges, but argued that the distributed denial of service attacks constituted acts of cyber-civil disobedience."
 Activity , 2010s ,"On August 19, 2011, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer held a press conference to announce that charges against food sharers arrested in Lake Eola Park, Orlando, were dropped, resulting in a new state of compromise between Buddy Dyer's administration and Orlando Food Not Bombs.An ordinance in Sarasota, Florida, in 2011 required a special event permit for gatherings of 75 or more people. Local condominium residents petitioned to require permits for even smaller groups of 12, as well as a permit for vending in public. Numerous other ordinances targeted the homeless, including the banning of smoking and removing park benches."
 Activity , 2010s ,"At the time, homeless shelters in Gainesville, Florida could feed only 130 people at a time, leading to the formation of the Coalition To End The Meal Limit, who successfully lifted the meal limit and other rules in 2011. Food Not Bombs groups were heavily involved in supporting occupation camps across the US during the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement. A FNB kitchen was removed in a late night police confrontation with Occupy San Francisco in mid-October. C.T. Lawrence Butler joined Occupy Boston."
 Activity , 2010s ,"Keith McHenry participated in many camps and released a new FNB handbook.A Food Not Bombs World Gathering took place August 20–26, 2012, in Tampa, Florida - the week before the Republican National Convention."
 Activity , 2010s ,"In conjunction with Occupy Tampa and many other organizations, FNB activists collected and prepared food for hundreds of RNC protesters and offered workshops, cultural events, and protest activities from August 20–30.Near the end of 2012, FNB activists, in particular, Long Island FNB, fed thousands of people in the wake of Superstorm Sandy alongside ""Occupy Sandy."" The outpouring of food going to waste and support for disaster-stricken, impoverished communities culminated in the ""Largest Food Not Bombs Ever"" at the ""Hempstead Food Share Bonanza"" on Nov. 18th.In November 2014, the city of Fort Lauderdale enacted a sharing ban."
 Activity , 2010s ,"Several Food Not Bombs activists were arrested sharing food and other acts of civil disobedience, for which they received ""Civil Liberties Arrest"" medals from the Broward County ACLU. Other FNB activists went on hunger strike against enforcement of the law. A court injunction stopped enforcement of the sharing ban in early December 2014 pending several court cases. On August 22, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled that outdoor food sharing by Food Not Bombs was protected under the First Amendment. ""Politics: Food Not Bombs Book"".

 The food system ,,"In most cases, rescued food is being saved from being thrown into a dumpster and, ultimately, landfills or other garbage disposals. Food recovered on farms is kept from being plowed under. On farms, the donations often must be harvested, or gleaned, by volunteers. Also, to help rescue food that would otherwise be wasted, the USDA has expanded their Farm Storage Facility Loan Program."
 The food system ,,"The Farm Storage Facility Loan Program helps farmers obtain low-cost loans for more farm storage so they can protect more food from becoming waste.In the United States, businesses that source food rescue programs have received tax benefits for their donations and have been protected from liability lawsuits by the federal Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act since 1996.The benefit of many food rescue programs is they offer healthy food to those in need but who may not meet the application requirements of state food-assistance programs. Many programs also provide immediate emergency assistance, without having to wait through an application process."
 The food system ,,"Food rescue organizations are less restricted by cost and availability of food, as so much edible food is thrown out and free for the taking, so eligibility requirements are generally unnecessary. This organizational model often allows food rescues to provide nutritional assistance more quickly, with more flexibility and accessibility than other types of hunger relief programs. There are various ways to rescue food that would otherwise go to a landfill, as described in the priority levels of the Waste hierarchy."
 The food system ,,"The United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends actions such as (in order of preference): source reduction, feeding hungry people, feeding animals, industrial use, and composting, all of which are preferred to the least desirable options, incineration and landfill."
 Food reuse strategies , Source reduction ,"Reduce the amount of food that is generated and potentially wasted. At an individual level, food waste results from choices made during the planning, shopping, storing, preparing, cooking, eating, and discarding of food. Individuals can for example make shopping lists so they do not buy more food than they really need, to reduce food waste at the household level. They can also buy smaller amounts of produce more frequently, to avoid spoilage at home."
 Food reuse strategies , Source reduction ,"Studies of food waste behaviors suggest that another reason that people waste food is misconceptions about date labeling, so learning about food labels can help to reduce waste. A useful tactic is to use visual prompts such as brightly colored tape to mark foods that need to be used soon. Reminders that cue people about what to use can be particularly helpful in large households.Source reduction is often advocated at all stages of the Food supply chain, and could be achieved via Prevention and valorisation pathways for human consumption, such as food donations, or upcycling and re-processing into new food products."
 Food reuse strategies , Source reduction ,"This can also include measures to overcome current hinders that limits the food potential per produced unit of food, such as unharvested ""ugly"" vegetables at farms, ""best-before"" dates at retail level, or under utilized by-products from food processing. Via source reduction, by either recovering food resources for human consumption or preventing waste generation, the food potential can be increased. A higher food potential can support self-sustainability and self-sufficiency, which in turn can infer both environmental, economic and social benefits."
 Food reuse strategies , Source reduction ,"The Flashfood app, designed by Josh Domingues, is being used in Canada and the United States to keep edible food from becoming waste. It notifies users of deeply discounted groceries, encouraging shoppers to buy soon-to-be-remaindered foods. They can make their purchase online, then go by the store to pick up their food. Initially focusing on restaurants and bakeries, the Too Good to Go app enables customers to buy discounted Surprise Bags of food. Too Good to Go was first used in Denmark in 2015 and was in use in 15 countries as of 2022."
 Food reuse strategies , Human consumption ,"Organizations can donate both non-perishable and unspoiled perishable food at the end of its shelf life to food banks, food pantries, food rescue programs, homeless shelters, and other organizations that redistribute food.Individuals who practice food rescue are sometimes referred to as freegans or dumpster divers."
 Food reuse strategies , Feeding animals ,"Many animals can eat food scraps. However, with animals as well as humans, spoiled or contaminated foods may cause illness. As described in a standard for animal care: ""Food must be fresh, palatable, uncontaminated with biological or chemical agents, and nutritionally adequate for the intended species."" Some farmers, solid waste collectors and recycling centers collect discarded food for use by animals. Local laws for the collection and use of such foods will vary."
 Food reuse strategies , Industrial uses ,"Anaerobic digestion is a conversion process that converts food waste and other types of organic waste into renewable energy. Food is separated from any packaging before being broken down into a more digestible state and mixed with bacteria in oxygen free holding tanks known as digesters. The bacteria work to break down the waste converting it into methane biogas which can be used to generate electricity.Hydrothermal liquefaction is the process of heating food waste under high pressure, converting the food waste into an oil that can then be refined into fuel."
 Food reuse strategies , Industrial uses ,"Once the initial liquefaction is complete, the watery waste left over then goes through anaerobic digestion where the microbes break down the waste into methane and carbon dioxide biogas. This biogas can be used for heat and electricity.It is also possible to use fats, oils, grease, and meat products for rendering and biodiesel production."
 Food reuse strategies , Composting ,"Add remaining food waste to an existing compost. Composting has many benefits over general waste landfills, including reduced methane gas production and improving the quality of the soil. Organizations in communities around the world, and national and international agencies, are concerned with rescuing food, minimizing food waster, and preventing the release of greenhouse gases from decomposing wastes. The 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for a 50% reduction of global food waste at the retail and consumer levels worldwide by 2030."
 Countries , Australia ,"As of 2022 an estimated one in six Australians experiences food insecurity. Australia was the first country to adopt the Sustainable Development Goal of a 50% reduction in food waste, with the Australian government providing some support for food rescue initiatives. Australia’s leading food rescue organization is OzHarvest. OzHarvest works with over 3,000 food donors and 1,800 charities in Australia and has provided over 210 million meals. Locations can be found using its online resource locator.OzHarvest was launched in November 2004 by Ronni Kahn."
 Countries , Australia ,"As an event manager in the hospitality industry, Kahn had first-hand experience of the amounts of food being wasted at events. In addition to founding and directing OzHarvest, Kahn organized lobbying of the Australian government. In July 2005, Australia's Civil Liability Act was changed to enable OzHarvest and other organizations to repurpose food for charitable purposes without risk of liability."
 Countries , Canada ,"Food Banks Canada is a national charitable organization for food banks across Canada. In 2017, one in eight families (12.5%) in Canada were reported to be short of food. As of June 2022, Food Banks Canada researchers found that one in five Canadians (20%) reported going hungry. University students in Canada are a particularly high risk group for food insecurity. Meal Exchange, a Canadian charity, surveyed students at 13 Canadian universities. They reported that 56.8% of the 6,167 students surveyed in October 2021 experienced food insecurity, compared to 41.7% of respondents in 2020."
 Countries , Canada ,"Indigenous, LGBTQ+ and international students were even more likely to be in need of food.Second Harvest Toronto was started in Toronto, Canada in 1985 by Ina Andre and Joan Clayton. They began working with restaurants, then moved up the supply chain to distribution centres, gathering donations that would have been landfilled before reaching grocery stores or restaurants. Second Harvest has developed partnerships with companies such as Canada’s largest food retailer, Loblaw's. Loblaw has donated over 1.5 million pounds of surplus food."
 Countries , Canada ,"Harvest Kitchens use donated food to prepare meals, which are then taken and redistributed to programs that serve seniors, the homeless, children, and others. Some Harvest Kitchens train volunteers in food service skills that they can then use to find work. Second Harvest supplies food to children and youth at summer camps through its Feeding Our Future program. In 2022, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the charity received requests for food for 6,000 children compared to the previous summer's 2,000 children, with demand outstripping supply."
 Countries , Canada ,"The Second Harvest Food Rescue App is used to connect businesses with surplus food directly to local nonprofits. The current CEO of Second Harvest Toronto is Lori Nikkel.Leftovers was started by Lourdes Juan in Calgary, Alberta in 2012, and has expanded to Edmonton and Hinton, Alberta and Winnipeg, Manitoba. By providing higher nutritional quality food, food rescue programs like LeftOvers can improve people's health.In Squamish, British Columbia, the Squamish Helping Hands Society works to combat homelessness through Under One Roof, a community centre with both supportive housing and food programs."
 Countries , Canada ,"It was developed in cooperation with the District of Squamish, BC Housing, Helping Hands, Vancouver Coastal Health, and the Food Bank. The Market and kitchen at Under One Roof receive donations of rescued food and provide food to the community for free or what the buyer can afford. The food hub of the building is planned to generate zero waste. Maureen Mackell became executive director of Squamish Helping Hands in 2010."
 Countries , China ,"China’s first food bank, the Green Food Bank in Shanghai, was launched In 2014. The food bank collects food that would be wasted and redistributes it to those in need. A recent initiative is an online marketplace where items are priced at RMB0.01, less than a US cent. People can shop privately from their homes, but are asked to provide government-issued documentation to verify that those using the system are in need (low income, disabled, etc.)"
 Countries , France ,"The French government has introduced national legislation to cut down on food waste. As of 2012, private sector companies producing more than 120 tons of organic waste per year were required to recycle it. Subsequent legislation requires recycling by all businesses producing at least 10 tons of organic waste per year. In 2016 France required supermarkets to donate their unsold food rather than throw it away."
 Countries , Guatemala ,"About 8% of the population of Latin America identify as Indigenous peoples. They are nearly three times as likely to live in extreme poverty than non-Indigenous people. In Guatemala, the food bank Desarrollo en Movimiento (DEM) partners with community organizations throughout the country, including communities that are predominantly Indigenous like the K’iche’ or Qʼeqchiʼ. The food bank has recognized that it needs to train its personnel and adapt its services to what is culturally appropriate for different regions."
 Countries , Guatemala ,"This can involve supplying different herbs and vegetables that are locally grown and used in different areas; avoiding foods with lactose, since many Indigenous people are lactose intolerant; and working with community leaders."
 Countries , India ,"No Food Waste started in 2014 in the city of Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. The organization has developed a food rescue and waste management network that recovers excess food from weddings, parties, and other events. In its Community Kitchens, No Food Waste makes and sells inexpensive hot meals for daily wage earners and others. Women from shelters and self-help groups help to staff the community kitchens and receive training in employable skills. No Food Waste serves over 5,000 people a day in 15 cities."
 Countries , Israel ,"Leket Israel is Israel's National Food Bank. It was started in 2003 by Joseph Gitler, an immigrant from the United States, in response to the waste he saw after weddings and other celebrations. Initially known as Table to Table, Leket Israel redistributes agricultural produce and cooked meals to those in need. Among its programs, Leket Israel's Soup Program delivers meals to the housebound. With the help of dietitians from the Ministry of Health of Israel, Leket holds nutrition workshops in Hebrew, Arabic, Russian and Amharic."
 Countries , New Zealand ,"New Zealand's first food rescue organization, Kaibosh, was founded in Wellington in August 2008 by Robyn Langlands. Langlands began by picking up food one night a week from a local store for the Wellington Women’s Refuge. Kaibosh has opened warehouses to store and organize food, hired drivers to transport donations, and helped to change legislation in 2014 to enable businesses to donate food without liability. As of 2022, Kaibosh operates three branches in Wellington, redistributing 60 tonnes of surplus food each month to more than 130 charities and organisations. Their goal is to achieve ‘Zero food poverty. Zero food waste’."
 Countries , New Zealand ,"The General Manager of Kaibosh is Matt Dagger.KiwiHarvest (originally FoodShare Dunedin) was established in the city of Dunedin on the South Island of New Zealand in March 2012. KiwiHarvest is part of the Aotearoa Food Rescue Alliance. It has received some support from the Ministry for the Environment through the Waste Minimisation Fund. A national food waste campaign, ""Love Food, Hate Waste"", is credited with popularizing FoodShare's model and helping it to expand to cities such as Auckland.Fair Food, Auckland's first food rescue organisation, was founded in 2011."
 Countries , New Zealand ,"Other organizations work in cities such as Hamilton, Tauranga, Palmerston North, and Christchurch.In Australia, initiatives for food rescue have been linked to a broader ""Fair Food"" or ""Community Food"" movement. Discussions of how food systems work include food security, food rescue, poverty, fair prices for farmers and producers, community and home gardening, locally-sourced food, buying Australian, and food sovereignty."
 Countries , Norway ,"A 2015 study listed 53 charitable organisations that were actively running food rescue programs in Norway. The largest donors were supermarkets (59%), followed by bakeries and other food producers. As of 2017, 98% of Norwegian supermarkets sold discounted food with a short shelf life in special areas, but only 48% of the supermarkets donated surplus foods to charity. Two supermarkets were highly active in donating surplus food: KIWI (90% of stores) and REMA 1000 (80% of stores). The distributors of rescued food were mainly charitable organizations, often religious, like the Salvation Army and the Church City Mission."
 Countries , Norway ,"Most of the work was done by volunteers, giving away food as prepared meals or bags of groceries. Distribution of free food was often used as a method for charitable organizations to enter into contact with people who need further help.On June 23, 2017 five Norwegian government Ministries and twelve of the country’s food industry organizations signed a binding agreement to halve food waste by 2030. The goal applies to all sectors of the food value chain from primary production to consumer. Responsibility was placed on those in the food industry to determine steps to be taken."
 Countries , Norway ,"Both authorities and the food industry are responsible for monitoring impact. Initiatives taken include the education of consumers about the meaning of ""use by"" and ""best before"" sale dates, the transfer of remaindered foods to charitable organizations for food rescue, and the development of a chain of grocery stores selling discounted foods that near their ""best before"" dates."
 Countries , Singapore ,"In Singapore the Foodbank Singapore is running their own Food rescue project, by collecting food excess in various places around the island state. After identifying a need for food accessibility 24 hours a day, Foodbank Singapore introduced Food Pantry 2.0 in 2019, distributing food through vending machines at locations that are accessible 24/7 to those with a special food credit card."
 Countries , South Africa ,"In South Africa, the Department of Environment, Forestry & Fisheries reports that about 1/3 of the country's food production is wasted annually: over 10 million tonnes of food. An estimated 30 million people are food insecure. FoodForward SA provides 950,000 meals daily to people in disadvantaged communities across the country. Its food distribution model connects with farmers, manufacturers, and retailers throughout the food chain. FoodForward SA was established in 2009 and as of 2019, developed a system of distribution points or Mobile Rural Depots (MRD) to better reach under-served rural communities in South Africa."
 Countries , South Africa ,"Each depot receives monthly food supply deliveries from FoodForward SA trucks. Local partner organizations collect and distribute food at the depots. In 2020, the MRD program worked with 108 organizations to feed over 50,000 people in remote areas."
 Countries , South Korea ,"Beginning in Seoul, South Korea in 2013, households were assessed a fee for recycling, based on the amount of food waste they discarded. The volume of waste in Seoul decreased by 10% over four years, and the program was expanded to 16 more Korean cities."
 Countries , United Kingdom ,"One estimate of waste in the United Kingdom suggests that 13.1 Mt of food waste is generated annually across the supply chain. The average household is estimated to discard the equivalent of eight meals per week. Organizations such as Fareshare and Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) work directly with food manufacturers to minimize food wastage in the United Kingdom. WRAP reported that over 106,000 tonnes of surplus food was redistributed in 2021, representing 253 million meals with a value of over £330 million. 69% of the surplus food was redistributed via charitable channels."
 Countries , United States ,"The EPA estimated that in 2015, the USA produced over 39 million tons of food waste. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) supported the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals of a 50% reduction of food waste. In supermarkets in 2018, 20-40% of produce was thrown away for not meeting cosmetic standards, even though much of it was edible.Numerous food rescue organizations and volunteers throughout the United States pick up and deliver food from companies and individuals, using refrigerated trucks where necessary."
 Countries , United States ,"Recipient agencies tend to serve people of low and no income.Sustainable America manages a directory of food rescue organizations that can be searched online, The Food Rescue Locator.

 Bacteria ,,"Some bacteria are responsible for the spoilage of food. When bacteria breaks down the food, acids and other waste products are generated in the process. While the bacteria itself may or may not be harmful, the waste products may be unpleasant to taste or may even be harmful to one's health. There are many species of pathogenic bacteria that target different categories of food. For example, Clostridium botulinum spoils food such as meat and poultry, and Bacillus cereus, which spoils almost all type of food."
 Bacteria ,,"When stored or subjected to unruly conditions, the organisms will begin to breed apace, releasing harmful toxins that can cause severe illness, even when cooked safely. Fungi have been seen as a method of food spoilage, causing only an undesirable appearance to food, however, there has been significant evidence of various fungi being a cause of death."
 Bacteria ,,"Fungi are caused by acidifying, fermenting, discoloring and disintegrating processes and can create fuzz, powder and slimes of many different colors, including black, white, red, brown and green.Mold is a type of fungus, but the two terms are not reciprocal of each other; they have their own defining features and perform their own tasks. Very well known types of mold are Aspergillus and Penicillium, and, like regular fungi, create a fuzz, powder and slime of various colors."
 Bacteria ,,"Yeast is also a type of fungus that grows vegetatively via single cells that either bud or divide by way of fission, allowing for yeast to multiply in liquid environments favoring the dissemination of single celled microorganisms. Yeast forms mainly in liquid environments and anaerobic conditions, but being single celled, it oftentimes cannot spread on or into solid surfaces where other fungus flourish. Yeast also produces at a slower rate than bacteria, therefore being at a disadvantage in environments where bacteria are. Yeasts can be responsible for the decomposition of food with a high sugar content."
 Bacteria ,,"The same effect is useful in the production of various types of food and beverages, such as bread, yogurt, cider, and alcoholic beverages. Signs of food spoilage may include an appearance different from the food in its fresh form, such as a change in color, a change in texture, an unpleasant odour, or an undesirable taste. The item may become softer than normal. If mold occurs, it is often visible externally on the item. Spoilage bacteria do not normally cause ""food poisoning""; typically, the microorganisms that cause foodborne illnesses are odorless and flavourless, and otherwise undetectable outside the lab."
 Bacteria ,,"Eating deteriorated food could not be considered safe due to mycotoxins or microbial wastes. Some pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus, are capable of causing spoilage.Issues of food spoilage do not necessarily have to do with the quality of the food, but more so with the safety of consuming said food. However, there are cases where food has been proven to contain toxic ingredients. 200 years ago, Claviceps purpurea, a type of fungus, was linked to human diseases and 100 years ago in Japan, yellow rice was found to contain toxic ingredients."
 Bacteria ,,"A number of methods of prevention can be used that can either totally prevent, delay, or otherwise reduce food spoilage. A food rotation system uses the first in first out method (FIFO), which ensures that the first item purchased is the first item consumed.Preservatives can expand the shelf life of food and can lengthen the time long enough for it to be harvested, processed, sold, and kept in the consumer's home for a reasonable length of time."
 Bacteria ,,"One of the age old techniques for food preservation, to avoid mold and fungus growth, is the process of drying out the food or dehydrating it. While there is a chance of it developing a fungus targeted towards dried food products, the chances are quite low.Other than drying, other methods include salting, curing, canning, refrigeration, freezing, preservatives, irradiation, and high hydrostatic pressure: Refrigeration can increase the shelf life of certain foods and beverages, though with most items, it does not indefinitely expand it. Freezing can preserve food even longer, though even freezing has limitations."
 Bacteria ,,"Canning of food can preserve food for a particularly long period of time, whether done at home or commercially. Canned food is vacuum packed in order to keep oxygen, which is needed by bacteria in aerobic spoilage, out of the can. Canning does have limitations, and does not preserve the food indefinitely. Lactic acid fermentation also preserves food and prevents spoilage.Food like meat, poultry, milk and cream should be kept out of the Danger Zone (between 4 and 60 °C (39 and 140 °F))."
 Bacteria ,,"Anything between that range is considered dangerous and can cause pathogenic toxins to be emitted, resulting in severe illness in the consumer. Another way to keep food from spoiling is by following a four step system: Clean, Separate, Cook, Chill. The detection of spoiled food can be crucial in preventing Foodborne illnesses, and various methods have been developed to detect spoilage. One such method is the use of biosensors, which are devices that use biological components to detect specific substances or changes in the environment."
 Bacteria ,,"Biosensors can detect spoilage by identifying the byproducts produced by bacteria or fungi during the spoilage process.Another method of detecting spoilage is through the use of gas sensors. Bacterial contamination of food and drinks can generate unpleasant odours and toxic substances, and e-noses(gas sensor) can perform odour detection continually and are not subject to individual sensitivity.Lastly, colorimetric analysis can also be used to detect spoilage in food products. Biogenic amines are the important markers for food spoilage, therefore, an on-package sensor for biogenic amine detection is crucial for food quality control."
 Bacteria ,,"The colorimetric sensors use a chemical reaction between a substance in the food product and a reagent to produce a color change. The color change can indicate the presence of spoilage, as well as the extent of the spoilage.These methods of detecting spoilage can be used in combination to provide more accurate results, while it is important to note that these methods are still in the research and development phase, and may not be available for commercial use. However, the development of these methods shows promise in improving food safety and reducing food waste."

 Household food waste ,,"A Waste Not Consulting report to the Ministry for the Environment “Household Waste Data 2008”, calculated that, in 2008, 1,048,993 tonnes of waste were generated by the residential sector, an average of 260 kg per person or 676 kg per household per annum. Over 44% of this household waste was organic, with 24.7% (or 258,886 tonnes) of the total being kitchen waste, and 19.6% being greenwaste (205,526 tonnes).More detailed research into food waste generated by households, that was disposed of through curbside rubbish collections, was conducted by Waste Not Consulting in 2014 on behalf of WasteMINZ."
 Household food waste ,,"The rubbish bins of 1,402 households were studied with their food waste sorted, weighed and costed. The study found that 229,022 tonnes of food is sent to landfill by households annually. Of this approximately 50% or 122,547 tonnes is avoidable food waste. The national cost of avoidable household food waste disposed of to landfill in 2014/2015 was $872 million pa. Eliminating this food waste would have the same effect as reducing CO2 equivalent emissions by 325,975 tonnes – equivalent to planting 130,390 trees or taking 118,107 cars off the road for a year."
 Household food waste ,,"Research done by Massey University academics in 2015 found that certain households created more food waste. These were households with more young people and households with larger numbers.This research was repeated in 2018 with the rubbish bins of 600 households audited. The study found that on average, New Zealand households were throwing away 3.15 kg of food a week via their domestic kerbside collection. This is down from 3.17 kg of food waste from bin audits conducted in 2014-2015 by Waste Not Consulting."
 Household food waste ,,"Due primarily to population growth over that time period 157,398 tonnes of avoidable food waste is being landfilled each year. The average New Zealand household in 2018 wasted $644 worth of food pa approximately 86 kilos. The top ten foods wasted in 2018 were: Bread 10% Left overs 8% Oranges and Mandarins 4% Apples 3% Bananas 3% Potatoes 3% Poultry 3% Rice 3% Lettuces 2% Beef 2%.Statistics on exactly how much edible food is wasted by households and composted, fed to animals or disposed of through a kitchen waste disposal unit is not known."
 Household food waste ,,"A 2014 survey of 1,365 households found that 66% of those surveyed disposed of some of their food through the council kerbside collection, with 47% disposing of some of their food through composting, 35% through feeding animals and 28% through a kitchen disposal unit. The Love Food Hate Waste Campaign launched in New Zealand on 1 June 2016. The campaign supports families to waste less food by encouraging behaviours to reduce food waste such as using leftovers and correct storage of food."
 Household food waste ,,"An evaluation of the campaign conducted in 2018 found that households who had heard of the campaign have decreased their food waste to landfill by 27.1%.Perceptions of food waste In 2014 a survey of 1,354 households was undertaken by WasteMINZ and people were asked how much food they thought they wasted and how much their weekly shopping bill was. People thought they bought $140 worth of food per week in their grocery shop and they estimated they wasted 5%."
 Household food waste ,,"So the total amount they thought they wasted was $390 per household per year which equates to $600 million per year A study was undertaken in 2017 by Rabobank with similar questions asked. People thought they bought $180 worth of food per week in their grocery shop and they estimated they wasted 12%. So the total amount they thought they wasted was $1,071 per household which equates to $1.8 billion per year. It is unclear whether this increased perception of the amount wasted correlates to an actual increase in the amount wasted."
 Household food waste ,,"The survey conducted by WasteMINZ in 2014 was repeated using the same survey methodology. People thought they bought $150 worth of food per week in their grocery shop a $10 increase and they estimated they wasted 5% no change with 2014. This suggests that the increased estimate of food waste by Rabobank is due to a difference in survey methodology rather than an actual increase. Research has been conducted into supermarket food waste in New Zealand by the University of Otago. Physical waste audits were conducted at New World, Countdown and PAK'nSAVE supermarkets around New Zealand in 2017."
 Household food waste ,,"In total it is estimated that 60,500 tonnes of food are wasted per annum by supermarkets in New Zealand. This equates to approximately 160 tonnes per store per annum. 15% of supermarket food waste is donated to food rescue groups and only 23% is sent to landfill with the balance sent to animal feed 46% or protein reprocessing 15%."
 Household food waste ,,"The most wasted foods are Vegetables 27% Bakery 23% Meat and Fish 19% Fruit 17%In New Zealand it is permitted to send food waste to pig farmers though the Biosecurity (Meat and Food Waste for Pigs) Regulations 2005, passed under the Biosecurity Act 1993, prohibits feeding pigs with uncooked meat or food that has been in contact with uncooked meat. In Auckland Ecostock Supplies collects & recycles food waste from manufacturers, retailers, importers and transport companies to make high-quality stock feed."
 Household food waste ,,"Supermarkets do not sell foods that are past their use by date or best before dates for legal reasons and perceived danger to health. Many supermarkets have partnered with food banks around the country and now donate tinned and packaged food which has passed its best before date, but it still safe to eat. There are 15 food rescue groups operating around the country as at 2019 such as KiwiHarvest in Auckland and Dunedin, Kaibosh in Wellington, Kaivolution in Hamilton, to rescue fresh food and produce. This is then distributed to local food banks and social agencies."
 Household food waste ,,"Most food banks do not report on how much dried or tinned food they have been donated, however 14 of the food rescue groups kept records of the tonnages of fresh food donated from supermarkets, manufacturers, growers and sometimes hotels and restaurants. In 2017 2,777 tonnes of food was rescued. In Wellington the Kai to Compost scheme addresses commercial food waste in the city. It was initially a trial scheme with government funding but is now a user pays scheme involving 50 businesses.Dumpster diving, especially at supermarkets, does still occur to gather discarded food."
 Household food waste ,,"Research conducted into hospitality food waste by the University of Otago and WasteMINZ in 2018 found that cafes and restaurants create 24,366 tonnes of food waste each year, of which 61% is avoidable. It is not known what percentage is sent to landfill as some businesses divert their food waste to composting facilities, food rescue collections or animals. For this research, food waste was divided into three categories: spoilage, preparation waste and plate waste. Spoilage occurs with the over-purchasing of ingredients or poor stock rotation, which causes food to spoil and be discarded before it is even used."
 Household food waste ,,"Preparation waste occurs in the kitchen and includes things like vegetable peelings, eggshells or toast that gets burnt. It also includes any unsold food that is left at the end of the day. Plate waste is whatever customers leave behind on their plate uneaten.Spoilage was found to be 7% of all food waste; preparation waste was 60% and plate waste was 33%. For cafés and restaurants, which offer prepared food such as scones, sandwiches, pies etc.; 30% of the preparation waste was unsold food."

 Background , Current situation of food waste in Hong Kong ,"The amount of food waste accounts for 38% of the municipal solid waste in Hong Kong. According to the statistics published by the Environmental Protection Department, Hong Kong generates approximately 3,648 tonnes of food waste each day. About one-third of the food waste comes from the commercial and industrial sectors while the remaining part is from households. The situation of food waste disposal in Hong Kong has become more serious in recent years. The amount of food waste from the commercial and industry sectors increased from 400 tonnes in 2002 to 1033 tonnes in 2014."
 Background , Three steps of food waste recycling in Hong Kong ,"Food waste recycling typically involves a three-step strategy that includes separation, collection and recycling. These three steps are interdependent and equally important in efficiently generating useful resources from food waste recycling."
 Background , Separation ,"The collected food waste is separated into two categories: pre-consumer food waste and post-consumer food waste. Pre-consumer food waste includes animal food waste, vegetable food waste, and waste from industrially-processed food. Post-consumer food waste refers to leftover food, such as from an unfinished restaurant order. Source separation also involves removing any food packaging and utensils."
 Background , Collection ,"Food waste vehicles, managed by the government, collect and deliver food waste to governmental recycling facilities. These recycling facilities, known as Organic Waste Treatment Facilities (OWTFs), will be spread across Hong Kong's districts. The government plans to construct 5–6 OWTF networks, with a goal of recycling 1300–1500 tonnes of food waste between 2014–2024. The first facility is planned to be built in Siu Ho Wan to serve Lantau Island and districts nearby. The second and third are projected to be built in Sha Ling and Shek Kong so as to serve the New Territories and West Kowloon."
 Background , Collection ,The Environmental Protection Department also plans to construct two Organic Resources Recovery Centres (ORRCs) to collect the food waste and turn it into compost for recovery. These two centres will collectively be able to treat 500 tonnes of organic waste and divert 200–300 tonnes of waste from the landfills daily. The first Centre will also be located in Siu Ho Wan. The construction works commenced in December 2014 and it is expected to be commissioned in early 2018.
 Background , Recycling ,"Two technologies are used to turn food waste into biogas and useful products. The first technology is a low-carbon method that processes 100–300 tonnes of food waste per day. By applying this technology, it produces a source of the renewable energy biogas. It is estimated that the first Centre will be able to provide 14 million kWh of electricity to Hong Kong's power grid every year, which can power 3,000 households. The second technology converts food waste into succinic acid by using enzymes and bacteria. The residues can be processed to be animal feed, fertilizers and environmental-friendly cleansing products."
 Hong Kong Food Waste Recycling program , Food Waste Recycling Partnership Scheme ,Food waste recycling partnership scheme is introduced by the Environmental Protection Department in 2009. The scheme was designed to promote a good practice on food waste management and enhance people’s experiences of separating and recycling food waste sources. The scheme collaborated with commercial and industrial sectors. Some members from the Hong Kong Government and that of the commercial and industrial sectors formed a working group for planning and managing the operation of the project. There are about 20–30 public and private organizations that participate in the scheme every year.
 Hong Kong Food Waste Recycling program , Food Waste Recycling Partnership Scheme ,"In the project, all the participants will have a chance to practice separation process of food waste sources. The collection process of separated food waste will be carried out by the Environmental Protection Department and the Kowloon Bay Pilot Composting Plant will be responsible to the recycling part. The scheme also consists of discussion sessions for the participating parties to share their experience of recycling food waste. All participants will receive a commendation certificate at the end of the project."
 Hong Kong Food Waste Recycling program , Food Waste Recycling Projects in Housing Estates ,"From November 2012 to July 2014, The Hong Kong Housing Authority implemented a trial scheme, named as Food Waste Recycling Projects in Housing Estates, with an aim to promote waste recycling in housing estates. The scheme involved 14 estates with about 3,200 households. There were two modes adopted in the scheme: One is to convert food waste to fish grain by transporting them to a Central Food Waste Recycling plant. The other is to convert food waste into compost for farm by using micro-organisms."
 Hong Kong Food Waste Recycling program , Food Waste Recycling Scheme on Cheung Chau and Lamma Island ,"On 31 March 2012, The Environmental Protection Department introduced a recycling scheme on Cheung Chau and Lamma Island. The purpose of the scheme is to promote and encourage food waste recycling on both islands. Food waste collected from shops and restaurants would be transported to the food waste treatment facilities on the islands. The food waste would be converted to organic compost."
 Hong Kong Food Waste Recycling program , Hong Kong Organic Waste Recycling Centre ,"Hong Kong Organic Waste Recycling Centre (HKOWRC) was established in 2011 as the first organic waste management consulting firm in Hong Kong. It combines local and foreign technologies to provide one-stop organic recycling services to customers. The assistance in collection of food waste solves problems of companies in immature recycling. Through commitment to different types of people, HKOWRC can promote and provide waste management training for particular customers."
 Hong Kong Food Waste Recycling program , Daily Food Waste Recycling Service ,"The objectives of the collection and recycling routine are to educate the general public in cherishing food as well as making good use of resources. The service encourages two-way cooperation for food waste recycling. HKOWRC aims to provide 24 hour recycling services particularly to livestock breeders, farmers, catering industry, schools and large-scale housing estates. For most of the cases, the recycled food waste is to be used by the service targets again for other purposes, therefore avoiding wastage of resources."
 Hong Kong Food Waste Recycling program , Daily Food Waste Recycling Service ,"For livestock breeders and farmers, the recycled food waste is converted to animal feeds and fertilizers that contain richer nutritional values than the conventional ones. It possibly gives higher yield. For catering industry, the recycled food waste is converted to crops which are grown from organic compost from HKOWRC for latest organic food at a special prize. For schools and housing estates, it aims to raise the awareness of food waste reduction when the recycling service reveals the huge amount of food wastes accumulated.

 History ,,"Freegans' goal of reduced participation in capitalism and tactics of recovering wasted goods shares elements with the Diggers, an anarchist street theater group based in Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco in the 1960s that organized free housing and clinics and gave away rescued food. The word ""freegan"" itself was allegedly invented in 1994 by Keith McHenry, the co-founder of Food Not Bombs—an anarchist group that distributes free vegetarian meals as a protest against militarism and as a way of providing ""solidarity not charity""—to refer to non-vegans who never pay for animal products."
 History ,,"McHenry's account is consistent with other published accounts of freeganism that show the word as beginning to be used in the mid-1990s by participants in the antiglobalization and radical environmental movements. The pamphlet ""Why Freegan?""—written by former Against Me! drummer Warren Oakes in Gainesville, Florida, in 1999—defines freeganism as ""an anti-consumeristic ethic about eating"" and goes on to describe practices including dumpster diving, plate scraping, wild foraging, gardening, theft, employee scams, and barter as alternatives to paying for food."
 History ,,"The pamphlet also expanded the activities associated with ""freeganism"" with a long section on non-alimentary practices, including conserving water, pre-cycling, reusing goods, and using solar energy. More than just a set of behaviors, though, the pamphlet presents freeganism as having an overarching political goal: an ""ultimate boycott"" of ""all the corporations, all the stores, all the pesticides, all the land and resources wasted, the capitalist system, the all-oppressive dollar, the wage slavery, the whole burrito"" in favor of ""liv[ing] a full satisfying life...while treading lightly on the earth""."
 History ,,"The first organized group of self-described ""freegans"" formed in 2003 as an offshoot of the Wetlands Preserve nightclub and associated Activism Center in New York City. According to the group freegan.info, ""After years of trying to boycott products from unethical corporations responsible for human rights violations, environmental destruction, and animal abuse, many of us found that no matter what we bought we ended up supporting something deplorable."
 History ,,"We came to realize that the problem isn't just a few bad corporations but the entire system itself."" From 2005, freegan.info organized regular events including sewing and bicycle workshops, wild food foraging expeditions, and ""trash tours""—public dumpster dives open to the public and to media. Studies usually find that most people that participate in practices associated with freeganism, such as dumpster diving for food, do so for economic reasons."
 History ,,"Freegans are usually distinguished as being a subset of this population which has an ideological or political motivation for recovering waste or avoiding consumption, although some freegans also say that they do so for amusement, to acquire free goods, or out of religious conviction. Anthropologist Loretta Lou has demonstrated how freeganism is closely related to notions of freedom, especially ""ethical freedom"", among some freegan practitioners in Asia."
 Motivations and ideology , Anarchism and anti-capitalism ,"Freeganism's initial practitioners and forerunners like Food Not Bombs were explicitly anti-capitalist, arguing that capitalism is responsible for excessive consumption, the abuse of human laborers and non-human animals, and the waste of resources. Freegans' approach to anti-capitalism is broadly anarchist in orientation: rather than seeking to seize state power, freegans claim to be engaged in ""prefigurative politics"", using wasted resources to build a new society ""in the shell of the old"" based on values of ""community, generosity, social concern, freedom, cooperation, and sharing""."
 Motivations and ideology , Anarchism and anti-capitalism ,"Freegan practices in theory reject the commoditization of basic necessities, the imperative of economic growth, and an economy based on money exchange rather than free gifting or sharing. Freegan organizations also often use consensus-based decision-making, popularized by the anti-globalization movement and later visible in anarchist-inspired mobilizations like Occupy Wall Street."
 Motivations and ideology , Veganism and food waste ,"The word ""freegan"" originated as a play on the label ""veganism"" and research on freegan.info in New York found that most participants were vegetarian or vegan prior to becoming freegan. In many cases, though, freegans critique vegans by arguing that vegans ignore the environmental and labor impacts of the products they buy and corporate ownership of many vegan product lines.Freegans' rejection of veganism is often tied to their discovery of food waste, estimated as up to 40% of the food supply in the United States and other Western countries."
 Motivations and ideology , Veganism and food waste ,"For many, statistics about the ecological impacts of food waste—up to 12% of global cropland and 23% of global freshwater goes to produce food which is never consumed—serve as justification for a complete rejection of the capitalist food system. Moreover, the presence of food in supermarket dumpsters shows, according to some freegans, that the vegan theory of social change is flawed, because markets do not efficiently translate consumer preferences into changes in production."
 Motivations and ideology , Back-to-nature ,"Some freegans associate themselves with ""back-to-the-landers"" or ""anarcho-primitivism"", the latter of which asserts that human beings should reject not only capitalism but civilization itself. With some exceptions, though, freeganism is a largely urban or suburban phenomenon. Some research suggests that freegans overcome this apparent contradiction by attempting to re-naturalize the city, treating urban waste as a ""natural"" resource and approach dumpster diving as a practice analogous to hunting or gathering."
 Practices , Urban foraging ,"Freegans are best known for recovering discarded food from commercial establishments, a practice known as ""dumpster diving"" or ""urban foraging"" in North America, ""skipping"", ""bin raiding"", or ""skipitarianism"" in the UK, ""skip dipping"" in Australia, ""containern"" in Germany, or ""doing the duck"" in New Zealand. Freegan diets are thus made possible by the range of practices that produce commercial food waste that is nonetheless still edible, such as conservative sell-by dates, the deliberate overstocking of certain perishable products (like baked goods), or aesthetic criteria for fruits and vegetables."
 Practices , Urban foraging ,"However, dumpster diving is not limited to rummaging for food; freegans report recovering clothing, books, appliances, bicycles, and furniture from commercial dumpsters as well. Although some freegans are reluctant to share their sites and strategies for ""urban foraging"", others—like those in freegan.info—have organized public events to raise awareness of food waste and recruit other practitioners. These events attracted significant media coverage, particularly between 2005 and 2009, from outlets such as The New York Times, Oprah, and MSNBC."
 Practices , Wild foraging and urban gardens ,"Instead of buying conventionally grown foods, wild foragers find and harvest food and medicinal plants growing in their own communities. Some freegans participate in ""guerrilla"" or ""community"" gardens, with the stated aim of rebuilding community and reclaiming the capacity to grow one's own food. In order to fertilize those guerrilla gardens, food obtained from dumpster diving is sometimes also reused, and some use vermiculture instead of ordinary composting techniques in order to keep the required infrastructure small and adapted to urban areas."
 Practices , Wild foraging and urban gardens ,"Some rural freegans are also ""homesteaders"" who grow their own food and employ alternative energy sources to provide energy for their homesteads, occasionally living ""off the grid"" entirely."
 Practices , Sharing ,"""Sharing"" is also presented as a common freegan practice, associated with the anarchist idea of a ""gift economy"". For example, Food Not Bombs recovers food that would otherwise go to waste to serve warm meals on the street to anyone who wants them. Really, Really Free Markets are free social events in which freegans can share goods instead of discarding them, share skills, give presents and eat food. A free store is a temporary market where people exchange goods and services outside of a money-based economy."
 Practices , Sharing ,"In New York City, freegan.info often distributes recovered food items for free in an ad-hoc manner after trash tours.Freegans also advocate sharing travel resources. Carpools and hitchhiking reduce, but do not eliminate, use of cars. Community bicycle programs and collectives facilitate community sharing of bicycles, restore found and broken bikes, and teach people how to do their own bicycle repairs. In the process, they aim to build a culture of skill and resource sharing, reuse wasted bikes and bike parts, and create greater access to green transport."
 Practices , Squatting ,"Just as freegans argue food waste should be recovered and redistributed, many argue that unoccupied buildings are a form of ""waste"" to be reclaimed. Squatting was widespread in Western Europe as well as parts of the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, and activists used squatted buildings not only for housing but also to create community centers, pirate radio stations, or free schools. A widespread crackdown by municipalities closed many squats and legalized the remainder in the 1990s—the moment when freeganism was emerging—and so it is thus difficult to know how many people are involved in this activity."
 Practices , Squatting ,"While research with freegans consistently shows that they endorse squatting, in practice, freegan living situations vary, ranging from trading work for rent to traditional home ownership."
 Practices , Working less ,"Working less is another component of freeganism. Freegans oppose the notion of working for the sole purpose of accumulating material items. They claim that their need to work is reduced by only purchasing the basic necessities and acquiring the remainder for free from the garbage. According to freegans, not working frees up additional time for political action while avoiding tasks they see as sacrificing valuable time to ""take orders from someone else, stress, boredom, monotony, and in many cases risks to physical and psychological well-being"". As with squatting, however, the degree of concordance between freegan ideology and practices is variable."
 Practices , Working less ,"In surveys, self-described freegans vary from reporting working only irregularly, working consistently in social justice organizations, and being employed in more conventional, ""capitalist"" occupations."
 Responses and criticism , Sanitation and stigma ,"Contact with waste is seen as a taboo and socially unacceptable in most developed countries, and freegans are often associated with stigmatized and racialized groups like the homeless or even compared to scavenging ""pest"" animals like raccoons. Some public health officials, like those in New York City, have explicitly discouraged dumpster diving for sanitation reasons and media coverage occasionally focuses on the ""ick"" factor of dumpster diving while (explicitly or implicitly) ignoring its political content. This discourse has been deployed more broadly to discredit anarchist movements by claiming they are unhygienic and thus dangerous."
 Responses and criticism , Sanitation and stigma ,"While some freegans argue that dumpster dived food is safe—noting it is usually thrown out because it cannot be profitably sold, not because it is no longer edible—others embrace the ""dirtiness"" of recovered food as a symbolic rejection of capitalist norms. The group freegan.info has made the disgust attached to wasted food part of its messaging, arguing that social disapprobation should instead fall on those who throw out food, rather than those who recover it."
 Responses and criticism , Parasitism ,"Freeganism has also been critiqued both by other radical movements and by mainstream commentators for the fact that its signature practice—dumpster diving—depends on the capitalist food system that freegans claim to be rejecting. A typical response is that freegan practices are not limited to dumpster diving, but include also actions like guerilla gardening, wild food foraging, or sewing or bike repair ""skill shares"" that are more fully autonomous from the conventional economy."
 Responses and criticism , Racial and class composition ,"Although activities like dumpster diving or gleaning are traditionally seen as subsistence strategies for the poor, most research on freegans finds that individuals come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds and have high levels of education (even if their present lifestyles make them low-income). Freeganism has also been described as racially exclusive, because freeganism's voluntary association of waste would seem to confirm a ""globally ubiquitous racial construction"" that people of color are dirty and polluted."
 Responses and criticism , Racial and class composition ,"As one freegan of color wrote, ""I am extremely embarrassed for people to see me diving, because I can tell that I'm not just me, I'm also a representation of black people in general...I got harassed by security several times while diving on my own campus, until my white friends pop their heads out of the dumpsters."" In contrast, the portrait of the gender balance of freeganism is more mixed, with some accounts saying groups are majority men and others majority women."
 Responses and criticism , Legality and commercial responses ,"The legality of freegan practices of reclaiming wasted food, space, or buildings varies depending on local laws around property, trespassing, and waste removal. In some places, like New York City, freegans dumpster dive publicly; in other locations, urban foraging is a secretive activity. In recent years, there have been arrests of people dumpster diving for political reasons in the United Kingdom, Belgium, and France, although in most locations charges have eventually been dropped."
 Responses and criticism , Legality and commercial responses ,"These actions could be seen as part of a broader criminalization of acts of survival—like sleeping in public places, sharing food without a permit, or recovering aluminum cans to re-sell—that has affected freegans as well as affiliated groups like Food Not Bombs and the homeless. Freegans report that stores have responded to waste recovery as well, including deliberately destroying products prior to disposing of them, locking dumpsters, or pouring bleach on food to make it inedible. In France, a new national law bans the practice of destroying food in this way."
 Responses and criticism , Legality and commercial responses ,"Media coverage of freeganism in the United States peaked around the financial crisis in 2007-2009 and dropped off subsequently. More recently, freeganism has been discussed in the context of increasing public interest in food waste. Tristram Stuart, a prominent food waste campaigner and founder of the organization ""Feedback"" claims that media attention to freeganism was crucial in attracting attention to the problem. Other analyses of the origins of contemporary public policy initiatives around food waste have also concluded that freeganism contributed to new initiatives, like the French law on food waste or the U.S. food waste reduction challenge."

 History and timeline ,,"Second Harvest was founded in April 1985 in Toronto by Ina Andre and Joan Clayton. Under the direction of Andre and Clayton, the organization began small and consisted of picking up waste food in a hatchback from restaurants and grocery stores and distributing it across the city.1994 — Ontario Legislature passed the “Donation of Food Act” or Good Samaritan Legislation releasing those who donate food or distribute donated food from liability in the event that an individual is affected by the consumption of that food, provided that due diligence is exercised."
 History and timeline ,,"This act enabled Second Harvest to accept donations from large food corporations, helping the organization to grow substantially.April 2015 — Second Harvest marked 30 years of delivering fresh, surplus food to Toronto's hungry."
 History and timeline ,,"July 2, 2018 — Lori Nikkel becomes the organization's first chief executive officer.October 26, 2018 — Second Harvest launches the Second Harvest Food Rescue App, a free tool for businesses to donate excess food.January 17, 2019 — Second Harvest releases The Avoidable Crisis of Food Waste, a world-first report co-authored Value Chain Management International, identifying the amount of food that is lost and wasted across the Canadian supply chain and the approximately 30 root causes of food loss and waste and over 100 solutions to limit the amount lost and wasted."

 Types of materials ,,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has assembled tools and resources for food waste management to assist communities interested in launching their own food waste reduction and collection efforts. SSO materials are typically collected in wet-strength paper bags, unlined plastic bins, or compostable film-plastic liners that meet ASTM 6400 standards. The organic fraction of the waste stream is increasingly viewed as a resource."
 Types of materials ,,"The resulting products – renewable energy and compost – benefit the environment: reduce greenhouse gas emissions; reduce dependency on foreign energy imports; increase the nutrient composition of our soils; reduce the amount of waste going to landfills; reduce the amount of wet, sloppy waste going to other methods of disposal; reduce the leachate associated with stormwater management at landfills; reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from uncontrolled landfill operations; improve erosion and stormwater control through biofiltration (Schwab, 2000). Communities and businesses that want to implement SSO programs face a few challenges."
 Types of materials ,,"First, they need participation at the source of their organic waste generation. Second, they need a hauler willing to collect the organic waste. Third, they need a composting facility permitted to process the material. These challenges have been overcome by many successful SSO programs. Tactics for addressing barriers to adoption include creating outreach and education materials, forging partnerships between local businesses to share fixed collection costs, and creating incentives for organic diversion through regulated tip fees for solid waste and organics."
 Types of materials ,,"Organic materials collected in SSO programs typically get delivered to composting facilities where the waste is turned into nutrient-rich soil amendments known as compost. Organic feedstock can also be delivered to anaerobic digestion facilities that produce biogas, a source of renewable energy. The resulting biogas (methane) can then be used for cogeneration (electricity and heat preferably on or close to the site of production) and can be used in gas combustion engines or turbines."

 History ,,"The company was created in 2015 in Denmark by Brian Christensen, Thomas Bjørn Momsen, Stian Olesen, Klaus Bagge Pedersen, and Adam Sigbrand. In 2017, Mette Lykke (co-founder of Endomondo) joined as CEO.In February 2019, the company raised an additional 6 million euros in a new round of investment. In August 2019, Too Good To Go was re-launched in Austria. In September 2019, Too Good To Go acquired the Spanish startup weSAVEeat and merged it into its own brand. In November 2019, the offer of Too Good To Go extended to plants through a partnership with the French retail plants company Jardiland."
 History ,,"In December 2019, Too Good To Go partnered with the French grocery retail stores Intermarché, and donated 60K euros to the French charity Restaurants du Cœur. In October 2021, Bonnie Wright teamed up with Too Good To Go to drive the initiative to reduce food waste.As of July 2023 the company Web site covered Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. The purpose of Too Good To Go is to reduce food waste worldwide."
 History ,,"It developed a mobile application that connects restaurants and stores that have unsold, surplus food, with customers who can then buy whatever food the outlet considers surplus to requirements—without being able to choose—at a much lower price than normal. The food on the app is priced at one-third its original price. The company claims this reduces the waste of food that would otherwise be discarded; food waste is a global problem that affects the environment. In three years active, the app reached more than 9.5 million users."
 History ,,"As of 2022, more than 57.7 million users and 154,000 establishments have signed up, and 139 million meals have been collected. In 2019, the company had 350 employees in Europe. As of June 2023 the company was estimated to have 1,289 employees. Food outlets must notify the TGTG company about what they have available on each day, stating what sort of food they have (baked foods, meals, produce, vegan food), and the price for a 'magic bag', whose contents they determine; the user cannot choose, but the original prices will be three or more times the TGTG price."
 History ,,"Notification is made early based upon the quantity predicted to be left over, not at the end of a selling period. Users must register to use the service. A mobile phone with an Internet connection running Android or iOS is needed. The user runs the TGTG app, which lists outlets available within a chosen distance and time range. The customer can then order and pay for a 'magic bag'. The supplier can cancel an order at any time if the expected surplus is not available—the purchaser is notified by text message—and the purchaser can cancel with two hours' notice."
 History ,,"The phone must be taken to the food supplier in a specified pickup time window, often 30 or 60 minutes long, and the transaction is finalised by swiping the app—connected to the Internet—to confirm collection. Official website"
 Chemical composition ,,"Most used coffee grounds are similar in chemical composition, although coffee grounds used to make instant coffee have fewer chemicals in them due to a more extensive extraction process. Used coffee grounds are rich in sugars, which comprise about half of their weight. A further 20% is made up of proteins, and a further 20% is lignins. The dry coffee grounds contain significant amounts of potassium (11.7 g/kg), nitrogen (2.8 g/kg), magnesium (1.9 g/kg), and phosphorus (1.8 g/kg). The quantity of caffeine remaining in used coffee grounds is around 48% of that in fresh coffee grounds."
 Chemical composition ,,"There are significantly less tannins in used coffee grounds than fresh coffee grounds. On average, 1 tonne of green coffee produces approximately 650 kg of spent coffee grounds, and over 15 million tonnes of spent coffee grounds are generated annually. In keeping with a life cycle approach to sustainability, this large quantity of waste requires waste management plans. Due to the amount of spent coffee grounds generated and the chemical properties of spent coffee grounds, the usage of spent coffee grounds is avidly investigated."
 Usage , In gardens ,"In gardens, coffee grounds may be used for composting or as a mulch as they are known to slowly release nitrogen into the soil. They are said to be especially appreciated by worms and acid-loving plants such as blueberries, although due to acids being leached from the grounds while in use, they typically have a neutral pH, and red wiggler growth and survival has been experimentally tested and found to be reduced in treatments using used coffee grounds as the primary feedstock for the worms. Used coffee grounds are particularly noted as a soil amendment."
 Usage , In gardens ,"Spent coffee grounds have phytotoxic properties which can be reduced through composting. Gardeners have reported the use of used coffee grounds as a borer, slug and snail repellent, but this has not yet been scientifically tested. Some commercial coffee shops run initiatives to prevent the grounds from going to waste, including Starbucks' ""Grounds for your Garden"" project, and community sponsored initiatives exist, such as ""Ground to Ground"" or the 'Green Coffee Shop Scheme' in Cambridgeshire, UK."
 Usage , Use in fortune telling ,In divination and fortune-telling the patterns of coffee grounds are used for predictions.
 Usage , Other uses ,"Initiatives have succeeded using coffee grounds as a substrate for the cultivation of mushrooms (including oyster mushrooms). The use of spent coffee grounds in this application has the advantage of the used coffee grounds needing no pre-treatment to be usable as a mushroom substrate. Used coffee grounds have other homemade uses in wood staining, air fresheners, and body soap scrubs. They may also be used industrially in biogas production or to treat wastewater. Bioethanol may also be produced from the sugar content of spent coffee grounds, after it is defatted as a pre-treatment, it is typically hydrolysed by dilute acid."

 First appearance ,,"It is thought that TV stations first started showing the caption as a self-defense measure, anticipating complaints from viewers who disliked food being handled roughly on TV variety shows. It's not clear when this annotation began to be used, but according to TV producer Kenji Suga, when a performance using small watermelons was broadcast in Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!! on Nippon TV, a viewer complained, ""Don't waste food."" As a result, he says, the TV station displayed this annotation on the screen the following year."
 First appearance ,,"There are various theories as to whether staff actually eat the dishes and ingredients that appear in the programs.According to AOL News in 2014, the crew on one information program testified that ""It's difficult for the reporter to eat all the food provided by the restaurant, so the staff instructed the reporter not to eat it all."
 First appearance ,,"However, the staff ate the rest of the dish in obligation of the restaurant."" In ""Meshizanmai Hurusatonoaji"" (Meshizanmai Taste of Hometown), published by food comic artist Raswell Hosoki and others, Eriko Miyazaki, a reporter for the cooking show, claims that the annotation is true, saying ""At least on the show I'm on, the staff eats all the rest of the dishes."" In January 2018, Miwa Asao, former professional beach volleyball player and TV personality, published photos on her blog of staff eating food after recording ""Saturday Night! Otona na TV"" (TVQ Kyushu Broadcasting)."
 First appearance ,,"She wrote ""This is a photo of the location shoot. The staff will eat the rest of the dishes."".Hitoshi Matsumoto, a comedian and TV host, was asked by sociologist Noritoshi Furuichi about this note in 2014 at the ""Wide na Show"" (Fuji Television). He said, ""I don't know if it's true or not. However, I've never seen the staff eating the rest of a dish."" Beat Takeshi (also known as Takeshi Kitano), Japanese comedian, television presenter, actor, filmmaker, and author, stated that no one eats food that fell onto the floor of their own accord in his book ""Bakaron""."
 First appearance ,,"A commentator, Tsunehira Furuya, also stated that the dishes used in the show are not eaten by the staff later, and are thrown away after the show. Tetsuya Uetaki has commented on displaying the note. Broadcast writer Sotani states that TV programs have become more sensitive to dealing with ingredients in programs and display annotations on the screen to prevent complaints from viewers. TV producer Kenji Suga also says that the strict restrictions make TV programs unexciting. Columnist Takashi Matsuo argues that adults, not TV shows, should teach children the importance of saving food."
 First appearance ,,"He also argues that if the parent feels uncomfortable about the child watching what the comedian is expressing on TV, then the parent should switch to another channel or turn off the TV instead of complaining to the TV station. Matsuo also points out the inconsistency that the ""the staff ate it later"" caption is not displayed even in scenes where a large number of tomatoes are thrown at the festival of Tomatina in Spain or when athletes are doing champagne fights to celebrate their victory."
 History ,,"Rudolf Diesel was the father of the engine which bears his name. His first attempts were to design an engine to run on coal dust, but he later designed his engine to run on vegetable oil. The idea, he hoped, would make his engines more attractive to farmers having a source of fuel readily available."
 History ,,"In a 1912 presentation to the British Institute of Mechanical Engineers, he cited a number of efforts in this area and remarked, ""The fact that fat oils from vegetable sources can be used may seem insignificant today, but such oils may perhaps become in course of time of the same importance as some natural mineral oils and the tar products are now.""Periodic petroleum shortages spurred research into vegetable oil as a diesel substitute during the 1930s and 1940s, and again in the 1970s and early 1980s when straight vegetable oil enjoyed its highest level of scientific interest."
 History ,,"The 1970s also saw the formation of the first commercial enterprise to allow consumers to run straight vegetable oil in their automobiles, Elsbett of West Germany. In the 1990s Bougainville conflict, islanders cut off from oil supplies due to a blockade fueled their vehicles with coconut oil."
 Application and usability , Modified fuel systems ,"Most diesel car engines are suitable for the use of straight vegetable oil (SVO), also commonly called pure plant oil (PPO), with certain modifications. Principally, the viscosity and surface tension of the SVO/PPO must be reduced by preheating it, typically by using waste heat from the engine or electricity; otherwise, poor atomization, incomplete combustion, and carbonization may result. One common solution is to add a heat exchanger and an additional fuel tank for the petrodiesel or biodiesel blend and to switch between this additional tank and the main tank of SVO/PPO."
 Application and usability , Modified fuel systems ,"The engine is started on diesel, switched over to vegetable oil as soon as it is warmed up, and switched back to diesel shortly before being switched off to ensure that no vegetable oil remains in the engine or fuel lines when it is started from cold again. In colder climates it is often necessary to heat the vegetable oil fuel lines and tank as it can become very viscous and even solidify. Single-tank conversions were developed largely in Germany and are now used throughout Europe."
 Application and usability , Modified fuel systems ,These conversions are designed to provide reliable operation with rapeseed oil that meets the German rapeseed oil fuel standard DIN 51605. Modifications to the engine's cold start regime assist combustion on start up and during the engine warm up phase. Suitably modified indirect injection (IDI) engines have proven to be operable with 100% PPO down to temperatures of −10 °C (14 °F). Direct injection (DI) engines generally have to be preheated with a block heater or diesel fired heater. The exception is the VW TDI (Turbocharged Direct Injection) engine for which a number of German companies offer single-tank conversions.
 Application and usability , Modified fuel systems ,For long-term durability it has been found necessary to decrease the oil change interval and pay increased attention to engine maintenance.
 Application and usability , Unmodified indirect injection engines ,"Many cars powered by indirect injection engines supplied by in-line injection pumps, or mechanical Bosch injection pumps are capable of running on pure SVO/PPO in all but winter temperatures. The most popular of these are the OM616 and OM617 engines found in the Mercedes-Benz W123 and W124 vehicles manufactured from 1980 through 1985. Indirect injection Mercedes-Benz vehicles with in-line injection pumps and cars featuring the PSA XUD engine tend to perform reasonably, especially as the latter is normally equipped with a coolant heated fuel filter. Engine reliability would depend on the condition of the engine."
 Application and usability , Unmodified indirect injection engines ,"Attention to maintenance of the engine, particularly of the fuel injectors, cooling system and glow plugs will help to provide longevity. Ideally the engine would be converted."
 Application and usability , Vegetable oil blending ,"The relatively high kinematic viscosity of vegetable oils must be reduced to make them compatible with conventional compression-ignition engines and fuel systems. Cosolvent blending is a low-cost and easy-to-adapt technology that reduces viscosity by diluting the vegetable oil with a low-molecular-weight solvent. This blending, or ""cutting"", has been done with diesel fuel, kerosene, and gasoline, among others; however, opinions vary as to the efficacy of this. Noted problems include higher rates of wear and failure in fuel pumps and piston rings when using blends."
 Application and usability , Home heating ,"When liquid fuels made from biomass are used for energy purposes other than transport, they are called bioliquids or biofuels.With often minimal modification, most residential furnaces and boilers that are designed to burn No. 2 heating oil can be made to burn either biodiesel or filtered, preheated waste vegetable oil (WVO). New standard oil burners are certified to operate on 20% biodiesel (B-20). Higher blends are possible with care, since biodiesel tends to liberate existing tarry deposits in fuel tank, which may tend to clog one or more filters."
 Application and usability , Home heating ,"Conventional oil burners tend to clog and char if more than a smaller fraction of vegetable oil is mixed with conventional oil fuel. If the vegetable oil is cleaned at home by the consumer, WVO can result in considerable savings. Many restaurants will receive a minimal amount for their used cooking oil, and processing to a biofuel is fairly simple and inexpensive. Making the oil into biodiesel involves some toxic and hazardous chemical transformations."
 Application and usability , Home heating ,"Burning filtered WVO directly is somewhat more problematic, since it is more viscous and has a higher ignition temperature; nonetheless, its burning can be accomplished with suitable preheating or burners designed to operate on it. WVO can thus be an economical heating option for those with the necessary mechanical and experimental aptitude."
 Application and usability , Combined heat and power ,"A number of companies offer compression ignition engine generators optimized to run on plant oils where the waste engine heat is recovered for heating. The main form of SVO/PPO used in the UK is rapeseed oil (also known as canola oil, primarily in the United States and Canada) which has a freezing point of −10 °C (14 °F). However the use of sunflower oil, which gels at around −12 °C (10 °F), is currently being investigated as a means of improving cold-weather starting."
 Application and usability , Combined heat and power ,"However, oils with lower gelling points tend to be less saturated (leading to a higher iodine number) and polymerize more easily in the presence of atmospheric oxygen."
 Properties , Material compatibility ,"Polymerization also has been consequentially linked to catastrophic component failures such as injection pump shaft seizure and breakage, injector tip failure leading to various and/or combustion chamber components damaged. Most metallurgical problems such as corrosion and electrolysis are related to water-based contamination or poor choices of plumbing (such as copper or zinc) which can cause gelling – even with petroleum-based fuels."
 Properties , Temperature effects ,"Some Pacific island nations are using coconut oil as fuel to reduce their expenses and their dependence on imported fuels while helping stabilize the coconut oil market. Coconut oil is only usable where temperatures do not drop below 17 degrees Celsius (63 degrees Fahrenheit), unless two-tank SVO/PPO kits or other tank-heating accessories, etc. are used. The same techniques developed to use, for example, canola and other oils in cold climates can be implemented to make coconut oil usable in temperatures lower than 17 degrees Celsius (63 degrees Fahrenheit)"
 Availability , Recycled vegetable oil ,"Recycled vegetable oil, also termed used vegetable oil (UVO), waste vegetable oil (WVO), used cooking oil (UCO), or yellow grease (in commodities exchange), is recovered from businesses and industry that use the oil for cooking. As of 2000, the United States was producing in excess of 11 billion liters (2.9 billion U.S. gallons) of recycled vegetable oil annually, mainly from industrial deep fryers in potato processing plants, snack food factories, and fast food restaurants."
 Availability , Recycled vegetable oil ,"If all those 11 billion liters could be recycled and used to replace the energy equivalent amount of petroleum (an ideal case), almost 1% of US oil consumption could be offset. Utilizing recycled vegetable oil as a replacement for standard petroleum-derived fuels like gasoline would reduce the price of gasoline by preserving the supply of petroleum."
 Availability , Virgin vegetable oil ,"Virgin vegetable oil, also termed pure plant oil or straight vegetable oil, is extracted from plants solely for use as fuel. In contrast to used vegetable oil, is not a byproduct of other industries, and thus its prospects for use as fuel are not limited by the capacities of other industries. Production of vegetable oils for use as fuels is theoretically limited only by the agricultural capacity of a given economy. However, doing so detracts from the supply of other uses of pure vegetable oil."
 Legal implications , Taxation of fuel ,"Taxation on SVO/PPO as a road fuel varies from country to country. It is possible that the revenue departments in many countries are even unaware of its use or consider it too insignificant to legislate. Germany used to have 0% taxation, resulting in it being a leader in most developments of the fuel use."
 Mechanism and effects ,,"Staling is a chemical and physical process in bread and similar foods that reduces their palatability. Staling is not simply a drying-out process due to evaporation. One important mechanism is the migration of moisture from the starch granules into the interstitial spaces, degelatinizing the starch; stale bread's leathery, hard texture results from the starch amylose and amylopectin molecules realigning themselves causing recrystallisation. Stale bread is dry and hard. Bread will stale even in a moist environment, and stales most rapidly at temperatures just above freezing."
 Mechanism and effects ,,"While bread that has been frozen when fresh may be thawed acceptably, bread stored in a refrigerator will have increased staling rates."
 Stale bread , Culinary uses ,"Many classic dishes rely upon otherwise unpalatable stale bread. Examples include bread sauce, bread dumplings, and flummadiddle, an early American savoury pudding. There are also many types of bread soups such as wodzionka (in Silesian cuisine) and ribollita (in Italian cuisine). An often-sweet dish is bread pudding. Cubes of stale bread can be dipped in cheese fondue, or seasoned and baked in the oven to become croutons, suitable for scattering in salads or on top of soups."
 Stale bread , Culinary uses ,"Slices of stale bread soaked in an egg and milk mixture and then fried turn into French toast (known in French as pain perdu - lost bread). In Spanish and Portuguese cuisines migas is a breakfast dish using stale bread, and in Tunisian cuisine leblebi is a soup of chickpeas and stale bread. Stale bread or breadcrumbs made from it can be used to ""stretch"" meat in dishes such as haslet (a type of meatloaf in British cuisine, or meatloaf itself) and garbure (a stew in French cuisine)."
 Stale bread , Culinary uses ,"It can be a subsidiary ingredient in dishes such as fattoush (a type of salad in Levantine cuisine). Stale bread can be used as a base for dips such as skordalia (in Greek cuisine), or substituted with another ingredient. In medieval cuisine, slices of stale bread, called trenchers, were used instead of plates."
 Stale bread , Countermeasures ,"Anti-staling agents used in modern bread include wheat gluten, enzymes, and glycerolipids, mainly monoglycerides and diglycerides."
 Stale bread , Destaling ,"Stale bread can be partially made fresh again by heating to 60°C in a conventional oven or microwave oven. Gray, J.A.; Bemiller, J.N.

 History ,,"In December 1994, homelessness charity Crisis partnered with Sainsbury's to establish Crisis FareShare, a London-based operation which aimed to co-ordinate the redistribution of surplus food from industry donors to hostels and homeless shelters in the city. Marks & Spencer and Pret a Manger were among its first suppliers. By 1999, the charity was operating out of seven cities, including Birmingham, Manchester and Huddersfield.In 2004, FareShare became an independent charity, in order to expand its operation further and support others beside the homeless."
 History ,,"The FareShare network currently comprises more than twenty regional centres throughout the UK, although the majority of these are independently managed by local organisations. In 2015, FareShare launched its FareShare Go app, which connects frontline charities with local supermarkets that have surplus stock available. Participating supermarkets include Tesco, Waitrose and Asda, and in 2022, Booker became the first wholesaler to sign up to the scheme.In February 2018, Asda committed to a £20 million investment in FareShare and The Trussell Trust, with the aim of helping more than one million people out of food poverty over the following three years."
 History ,,"This included the funding of new refrigeration equipment and delivery vehicles.During the Covid-19 lockdowns starting on 23 March 2020, the FareShare network remained open and operational to continue to get food to vulnerable people. In the first month of lockdown, the amount of surplus food received and distributed by FareShare more than doubled, following the overnight closure of the restaurant, pub, hotel and catering trades. Supermarket partners such as the Co-op also provided additional food donations and funding to help FareShare meet the increased demand from frontline charity members."
 History ,,"In December 2020, the company received a £16 million government grant to support its operation through the winter.According to its annual report, FareShare redistributed 53,894 tonnes of food in 2021/2022, equivalent to 128.3 million meals. This food is delivered to a broad range of frontline charities and community groups across the UK including foodbanks, homeless shelters, day centres, women's refuge centres and children's breakfast clubs."
 History ,,"FareShare provides food for children's holiday clubs as part of its #ActiveAte campaign, which endeavours to raise the profile of the issue of ""Holiday Hunger"", where children eligible for a free school lunch do not have access to this meal during the 13 weeks of school holidays. In 2020, FareShare partnered with England and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford, who now works with the charity to raise awareness of this issue and to campaign for donations from industry suppliers."
 History ,,"Rashford also leads the Child Food Poverty Taskforce, of which FareShare is a founding member; the taskforce seeks the urgent implementation of the three recommendations focused on supporting children in the National Food Strategy published by Henry Dimbleby. In 2010, FareShare won ""Britain's Most Admired Charity"" at the Third Sector awards. In 2017, it won ""Charity of the Year"" at both the Charity Times awards and Third Sector Awards, and was selected for The Telegraph's Christmas Charity Appeal."
 History ,,"In 2019, the charity won the Food and Drink Federation's Campaign of the Year award for the Feed People First campaign, which helped to unlock £15 million of DEFRA funding to ""level the playing field"" for the food industry of the cost to redistribute food to vulnerable people, as opposed to sending it to landfill or anaerobic digestion. It also won the Charity Times 2019 award for ""Corporate National Partnership with a Retailer"" and the Business Charity Awards 2019 ""Consortium"" award, along with the Trussell Trust and Asda, for the ""Fight Hunger Create Change"" project."

 History ,,"Food waste was identified as a problem in the UK as early as World War I. Combating food waste was one of the initial goals of the Women's Institutes (WI), set up in 1915, and remains a subject of their campaigns. Rationing was adopted during World War I, although it was voluntary, from February 1917; it was only between December 1917 and February 1918 that rationing began, in stages, to be made compulsory. As well, there is no evidence to suggest that by 1918 fines were imposed on either individuals or businesses for wasting food."
 History ,,"Meanwhile, in the United States (where shortages were hardly comparable), legislators considered laws restricting the distribution of food in order to cut waste, breaches of which might be punishable by fines or imprisonment.During World War II, rationing was imposed almost immediately. Restrictions were immediately more stringent than in the Great War as with effect from 8 January 1940, ration books were issued and most foods were subject to ration. By August 1940, legislation was passed that made the wasting of food a prisonable offence. Posters encouraged kitchen waste to be used for feeding animals, primarily swine but also poultry."
 History ,,"Many of the methods suggested by current campaigns to prevent food waste have taken inspiration from those of World War II. Despite this, it remains debatable whether the waste campaigns and rationing, during and post-WWII, achieved any long-term change in people's attitudes towards waste; WRAP's report on domestic household waste found older people to waste as much avoidable waste as younger people. Further, as early as 1980, only twenty-five years after rationing was fully abolished, a journal article published that year found significant levels of waste at home, in restaurants and in sectors of the food industry."
 History ,,"However, the rising amount of food waste could also be attributed to a change of lifestyle, for instance the buying of produce which has a shorter shelf life; which would involuntarily lead to more food being thrown away.By the late-1990s, things had worsened, and the food manufacturing sector was estimated to be generating over 8,000,000 tonnes of food waste annually. A documentary in 1998 revealed tonnes of edible food being discarded at a Tesco store, provoking a renewed response on the issue of food waste."
 History ,,"In 2000, the UK Government created the Waste & Resources Action Programme (WRAP), a government-funded, not-for-profit company that advises on how to reduce waste and use resources efficiently. In 2007, WRAP launched the ""Love Food, Hate Waste"" campaign and returned food waste to the forefront of the news and public agenda."
 History ,,"Two years later, the ""Love Food, Hate Waste"" campaign claimed to have prevented 137,000 tonnes of waste being sent to landfill and saved £300,000,000.In 2005, facing ""limited information about the amounts and types of food waste produced"", WRAP launched a ""major research programme"" which would lead to the publishing of ""The food we waste report"" on 8 May 2008. Believed at the time to be ""the first of its kind in the world"", the report interviewed 2,175 householders and collected waste from 2,138 of them."
 History ,,"Since the developments of 2007-08, food waste has continued to be a subject of attention, discussed in almost every major UK newspaper, often with issues such as climate change and famine in African nations. To reduce the impact of the aforementioned, food waste has been among the topics of discussion at recent International Summits; food waste was debated during the 34th G8 summit in Hokkaidō, Japan, as part of the discussion on the 2007–2008 world food price crisis.In June 2009, then-Environment Secretary Hilary Benn announced the ""War on waste"", new government plans aimed at reducing Britain's food waste."
 History ,,"Planned is the removal of ""best before"" labels and the limiting of ""sell by"" labels on foods. New food packaging sizes are planned to be introduced, coming as EU rules on packaging sizes are lifted and people are increasingly living alone. Five flagship anaerobic digestion plants that will demonstrate ""cutting-edge technology"" are to be built before the end of March 2011; they will together receive a grant of £10,000,000 from WRAP's ""Anaerobic Digestion Demonstration Programme"". Liz Goodwin, WRAP Chief Executive Officer, said of the five projects: ""These projects are truly ground-breaking."
 History ,,"Between them, they demonstrate how anaerobic digestion can help the UK efficiently meet the challenges of reducing carbon emissions and improving sustainable food production.""The UK Government's ""Resources and Waste Strategy"", published in December 2018, set out current government policy on ""how we will preserve our stock of material resources by minimising waste, promoting resource efficiency and moving towards a circular economy""."

 Causes , Households ,"The single largest producer of food waste in the United Kingdom is the domestic household. In 2007, households created 6,700,000 tonnes of food waste – accounting for 19 per cent of all municipal solid waste. Potatoes account for the largest quantity of avoidable food disposed of; 359,000 tonnes per year are thrown away, 49 per cent (177,400 tonnes) of which are untouched. Bread slices account for the second food type most disposed of (328,000 tonnes per year), and apples the third (190,000 tonnes per year)."
 Causes , Households ,"Salad is disposed of in the greatest proportion - 45 per cent of all salad purchased by weight will be thrown away uneaten. Much of the food thrown away could have been avoided (4,100,000 tonnes, 61 per cent of the total amount of food waste) and with better management could have been eaten or used. Unavoidable foods, such as vegetable peelings and tea bags, account for 19 per cent of the total, with the remaining 20 per cent being unavoidable through preferences (e.g. bread crusts) and cooking types (e.g. potato skins)."
 Causes , Households ,"However, the vast majority of consumers (90%) are unaware of the amount of food they throw away; individuals who believed that their household wasted no food were shown to be throwing away 88 kg of avoidable food per year.The amount of food waste produced by a household and its occupants is affected by several factors; WRAP found the most impacting factors to be: firstly the size of the household, followed by the age of the individual occupants and finally the household composition (e.g. single occupant household)."
 Causes , Households ,"The other factors: job status, lifestage, ethnicity and occupation grouping of individuals were found to have less correlation between the amount of avoidable waste.Regarding household size, the relationship is not proportional (two occupants do not dispose of twice as much food waste as one occupant); single-occupancy households, on average, throw away 3.2 kilograms (7.1 lb): per week the least food waste by weight but the most proportionately. This disproportional wastage has been partially attributed to food packaging sizes being largely inappropriate for people living on their own."
 Causes , Households ,"Families with children (under the age of 16), on a per household per week basis, are shown to waste the most food by weight (7.3 kilograms (16 lb)); when taken individually however, members of a family that includes children waste the least food (1.8 kilograms (4.0 lb))."
 Causes , Households ,"Contrary to both previous research and conventional wisdom, the report discovered that older people waste as much avoidable food as younger people (1.2 kg per person per week); in terms of mean average cost and weight of food waste, older people do waste less, although for retired households this may be because they are smaller."
 Causes , Retailers ,"Other sectors also contribute food waste. The food industry produces large amounts of food waste, with retailers alone generating 1,600,000 tonnes of food waste per year. Supermarkets particularly have been criticised for wasting items which are damaged or unsold (what the industry calls 'surplus food'), but that often remain edible. However, exact statistics for the amount of food wasted by supermarkets is mostly unavailable; although a few voluntarily release data on food waste, it is not required by law. Similarly, limited information is available on amounts generated by the agricultural sector."
 Causes , Retailers ,"Before a reversal of European Union policy in 2008, which came into effect on 1 July 2009, misshaped or 'wonky' fruit and vegetables could not be sold by retailers and were required to be thrown away. Food waste puts a large burden on the finances of each household and local councils in the UK; wasted food is estimated to cost each British household £250–£400 per year, accumulating to £15,000–£24,000 over a lifetime. This comes from the total purchasing cost of the food against what is thrown away uneaten."
 Causes , Retailers ,"Additionally, households pay for the collection and disposal of food waste by their local council in the form of council tax. For councils, the cost of food waste comes from its collection and disposal as a part of the waste stream; this is especially an issue for councils that run separate food waste collections."
 Causes , Retailers ,"Food waste is generally considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy."
 Causes , Retailers ,"The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.Internationally, food waste's effect on the environment has been an issue. Ireland is facing fines of millions of euros if the amount of biodegradable waste it sends to landfill does not fall below the maximum quantity set by the European Union's Landfill Directive."
 Causes , Retailers ,"By 2010, the same directive will impose fines of £40m a year across England, rising to £205m by 2013, if its own targets on biodegradable municipal waste are not met; the amount of biodegradable municipal waste being sent to landfill in 2010 must be 75% of that sent in 1995, by 2013 it must be 50% and by 2020 it must be 35%.In the context of the 2007–2008 world food price crisis and potential food shortages, food waste is an important and impacting issue."
 Causes , Retailers ,"The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) identified food waste as being a critical problem, a view shared by a Cabinet Office report on food; it said that doing nothing to solve it would lead to severe food shortages, which may trigger food price climbs of up to 50%. With a third of food purchased in the UK never eaten, the country was singled out in the report. UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner said that: ""Over half of the food produced today is either lost, wasted or discarded as a result of inefficiency in the human-managed food chain."
 Causes , Retailers ,"There is evidence within the report [The Environmental Food crises: Environment's role in averting future food crises] that the world could feed the entire projected population growth alone by becoming more efficient while also ensuring the survival of wild animals, birds and fish on this planet."""
 Response , Prevention ,"To reduce the food waste produced (often unintentionally or unavoidably, due to lifestyle) by consumers, advisory campaigns and articles have put forward varying advice and suggestions."

 Response , Prevention ,"to purchase food items that are eventually thrown away; as part of its own campaign on food waste, supermarket retailer Morrisons is to offer “One Free to Freeze” as a replacement for BOGOFs, with hopes that these promotions will encourage customers to plan ahead.Understanding food storage and food date labels is an important, but currently problematic, measure; in 2008, research by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) showed that food dates were poorly understood by consumers; only 36 per cent of people interpreted a best before date as a use by date and only 55 per cent correctly interpreted use by dates."
 Response , Prevention ,"Food date labels are planned to undergo radical changes as part of the ""War on waste"".Leftover foods can and are encouraged to be used in other meals; currently this is not widely undertaken due to a ""lack of confidence"". Specialist cookbooks and waste campaigns include recipes which are designed to incorporate typical leftovers and require minimal cooking skill. Sectors of the food industry (manufacturing and retail) have pledged to reduce the amount of food they directly waste, and additionally what they cause households to waste indirectly."
 Response , Prevention ,"This is planned to happen through a combination of: effective labeling, pack size range, storage advice and packaging that extends the duration of food freshness. The latest initiative in May 2009, rather than a new policy, is seen as an expansion to ongoing attempts to reduce the wider food packaging."
 Response , Prevention ,"The aim is to cut UK household food waste by 155,000 tonnes (2.5% of total waste) before the end of 2010 by helping UK households prevent food going to waste.Food charities, the most widely known being FareShare, arrange the distribution of surplus food from the food industry among disadvantaged people in the community."
 Response , Collection ,"The majority of UK authorities (some have varying or specific policy) collect food waste together with municipal waste; estimates made in 2007 put the amount of food waste collected separately, for either composting or anaerobic digestion, at only 2% of what is available. Where food waste is collected separately, it is usually incorporated into an existing garden waste collection."
 Response , Collection ,"If applicable, separate collections for garden and food waste typically run on intervening fortnightly weeks to those of municipal waste and share infrastructure and transport.It has been suggested that given its proportion of the waste stream and the lack of distinct collections, food waste is not currently being targeted appropriately. However proposals by the European Union, which would require local authorities to provide separate collection of food and garden waste, have been met with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they serve, and that they should decide waste policy."
 Response , Collection ,"Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable waste from other materials.Figures from WRAP revealed the most efficient method of collecting food waste to be separate collections, followed by mixed green and food waste on a weekly basis. A mixed fortnightly collection was shown to be the worst performing. This was considered confirmation of earlier suspicions that, if carried out correctly, separate collections can result in less wastage of biodegradable waste."
 Response , Collection ,"A widespread pilot scheme for separate food waste collection, involving nineteen English local authorities, achieved success and 'high levels of satisfaction' from households.One option for separating food waste at source is the in-sink food-waste disposer (FWD). It was invented in 1928 and is used in 50% of households in the USA, 34% in New Zealand, 20% in Australia and increasingly in some European countries, notably Sweden."
 Response , Collection ,"A FWD has no blades or knives, it has a grind chamber, the floor of which is a spinning disc with lugs spin the waste against the perforated wall of the chamber, particles exit when they are small enough. measured particle size distribution and found 98% <2mm. They also measured settleability and found the ground waste would be carried/resuspended easily in conventionally designed sewers."
 Response , Collection ,"estimated the Global Warming Potentials (100 year) of options for food waste management were landfill +740 kgCO2e/t food waste, incineration +13, centralised composting -14 and that anaerobic digestion was about -170 kgCO2e/t food waste whether it was kerbside collected and transported by truck or FWD to sewer to AD at a wastewater treatment works. In a follow-up paper, analysed data from Surahammar, Sweden comparing the time when there were no FWD with the present when 50% of households have FWD. This study verified laboratory etc. work published earlier by other workers."
 Response , Collection ,"They found there was no increase in wastewater treatment works' cost, nor the volume of wastewater but that there was a 46% increase in biogas."
 Response , Disposal ,"Food waste remains primarily disposed to landfill (54 per cent of total municipal waste was disposed of in this way in 2007/8), although year-on-year the amount being sent to landfill is decreasing.Composting, the purposeful biodegradation of organic matter by microorganisms, is among the most simple ways of treating food waste and thereby preventing it being sent to landfill. Since all biodegradable materials will eventually oxidise to become compost, the process can be undertaken at home with no running costs, although equipment can accelerate the process."
 Response , Disposal ,"Most components of food waste are putrescibles and will be broken down in a compost, however some exceptions will not (e.g. cooked foods and feces) and can attract vermin. The effectiveness of composting food waste depends on the available space (or storage capacity in the case of a compost bin) and the method of composting. Unlike in landfill, where it is mixed with other (non-biodegradable) materials, food waste decomposing in a compost does not release harmful gases."
 Response , Disposal ,"Similarly to compost created from other waste sources, composted food waste can be used to return nutrients to the soil if spread on the garden (see uses of compost). Anaerobic digestion (AD), the breaking down of biodegradable material by microorganisms in the absence of oxygen, is recognised as an effective method of waste disposal, with the potential to address the food waste problem nationally. AD technology has a small environmental impact, producing less greenhouse gas emissions than composting. However, although the process is well established in the water industry, it is less so within the waste sector."
 Response , Disposal ,"Despite this, the AD industry is being (and planned to be further) expanded by local councils and retailers to deal with food waste; several local authorities in the UK are planning to build anaerobic digestion plants, with the largest, to be located in Selby, due to operate from 2010."
 Response , Disposal ,"Supermarket chains Tesco and Sainsbury's are both adopting AD technology to dispose of their waste, while Tesco's head of waste and recycling said: ""As renewable energy technologies now become mainstream, there is no excuse for sending waste to landfill that could actually be put to positive use."" AD technology remains an experimental field though, and there is potential for advancements to increase efficiency. In July 2014 Sainsbury's began powering one of its stores using anaerobic digestion. Incinerating waste has traditionally been viewed as a method with the main purpose being the destruction of the waste involved."
 Response , Disposal ,"Recovering the energy generated from this process has become of greater importance, and all incineration facilities in England now operate as energy-from-waste plants (with many operating as combined heat and power facilities). Critics question the safety of the pollutants emitted during the process and argue that, as incinerators require constant levels of waste to operate, it encourages more waste. However, the levels of emissions from the incinerating process has been greatly reduced by developments in technology and legislation.

 History ,,"The concept of an association to promote sustainability in the restaurant sector originated at the London-based consultancy, Good Business, and was developed by Simon Heppner and Giles Gibbons during 2008. The Garfield Weston Foundation, the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and the Mark Leonard Trust provided funding and in 2009 the association launched with founder members Carluccios, Feng Sushi and Wahaca. The organisation has continued to evolve and develop each year since then, increasing the number of restaurants it is working with from 52 at launch to over 12,000 in 2019. In 2012, Raymond Blanc became president of the association."
 History ,,"The challenge for many businesses working in food service was that while sustainability was seen as important, there was no consistency in the way it was defined or addressed. This created confusion the mind of customers about what constituted a sustainable restaurant, and a barrier to action for restaurateurs, who were unclear on where to focus attention.One of the key aims of the organization has been to demystify sustainability in food service by creating a framework, covering all the elements, which go towards making a business more sustainable."
 History ,,"This framework was developed in partnership with subject specific specialists such as RSPCA, Fair Trade, Soil Association, Compassion in World Farming and the Carbon Trust, as well as other organizations working more generally in the area of food service sustainability such as Sustain."
 History ,,"The framework is divided into three main sections: Environment, social and sourcing and forms the basis of the assessment process by which the SRA rates business.Since 2009, the SRA has rated the sustainability performance of thousands of restaurants against this framework and awarded one, two or three stars and these now appear in restaurant windows and on menus as a signal to diners that the business is taking the issues seriously."
 History ,,"In 2010 the SRA carried out research into food-waste in different types of restaurants, aiming to understand the scope of the issue and clarify what constituted plate-waste, spoilage and prep waste. The results indicated that on average restaurants were producing half a kilo of waste per diner and that 65% was prep waste, 30% plate waste and only 5% spoilage."
 History ,,"The publication of the results shed light on the issue for the first time, appearing in WRAP's report Understanding out of home consumer food waste, and prompted the SRA to develop the Too Good To Waste campaign, which encouraged diners to ask and restaurants to offer doggy boxes to take leftovers home. SRA Awards"
 History ,,"WRAP was established in 2000 as a company limited by guarantee and receives funding from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Northern Ireland Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, the Welsh Government and the European Union. WRAP developed the ""Recycle Now"", ""Love Food, Hate Waste"" and ""Love your Clothes"" initiatives. These aim to help businesses, local authorities, community groups and individuals recycle and reuse more, and reduce food waste."
 History ,,"Over recent years it has also brokered a number of voluntary agreements with business including: The construction sector – with more than 700 companies succeeding in halving their waste to landfill by 2012 The retail sector – through the Courtauld Commitments, food and drink organisations are working together to reduce their burden on the environment. The clothing industry – through the 'Sustainable Clothing Action Plan', working together to reduce the clothing industry footprint through sustainable design, reuse and recycling. The Courtauld Commitments were initiated in 2005 at an event at the Courtauld Gallery in London."
 The Courtauld Commitment , Courtauld Commitment one ,"During 2005-2009 the Courtauld Commitment looked particularly at food packaging, and brought food waste onto the agenda."
 The Courtauld Commitment , Courtauld Commitment two ,"During 2010-2012 the Courtauld Commitment sought to go beyond reducing primary packaging to include secondary and tertiary packaging, and supply chain waste. It advanced from assessing packaging by weight to considering its carbon impact."
 The Courtauld Commitment , Third phase ,"From 2013 to 2015, food and drink organisations worked together to reduce food, packaging and supply chain waste. Signatories to the Courtauld Commitment include industry leaders such as Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and big brands such as Unilever and Nestlé. The European Union praised phase one as an example of best practice. The phase three targets are: Reduce household food and drink waste by 5% – this represents a 9% reduction in real terms to counter the expected increase in food purchased."
 The Courtauld Commitment , Third phase ,"Reduce traditional grocery ingredient, product and packaging waste in the grocery supply chain by 3% – signatories will have to make an 8% reduction in real terms to counter the expected increase in production and sales. Improve packaging design through the supply chain to maximise recycled content as appropriate, improve recyclability and deliver product protection to reduce food waste, while ensuring there is no increase in the carbon impact of packaging – signatories will have to make a 3% reduction in real terms to counter the expected sales increase."
 The Courtauld Commitment , Courtauld Commitment 2025 ,"During 2015-2018, commitments sought to address the sustainability of food & drink production and consumption. The agreement looked at food waste, water and greenhouse gas emissions."
 The Courtauld Commitment , Courtauld Commitment 2030 ,"As of 2023, the current phase of the agreement (Courtauld Commitment 2030), encourages collaborative action across the entire UK food chain aiming for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, food waste and water stress. These commitments fall within WRAP's four main business areas: food and drink waste reduction, sustainable electricals, sustainable textiles and resource management. WRAP is extending its work internationally, having recently worked in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to develop a global food waste guidance tool, part of the UNEP Think.Eat.Save initiative."

 Work ,,"The Felix Project redistributes food that supermarkets, wholesalers and other suppliers cannot sell for a variety of reasons, ranging from seasonal gluts and packaging defects, to changes in customer orders. It sorts and delivers food, free of charge, direct to local kitchens, community halls, schools, day centres and food banks. The charities provide meals, snacks or food parcels for their clients who include the elderly, the homeless, those with mental health issues, refugees and asylum seekers, families and children.Ten staff and nearly 200 volunteers provide food for over 1 million meals a year, working with 90 suppliers and 120 charities."
 Work ,,"A fleet of 10 vans operate from depots in Park Royal (West London), Central London and Enfield (North London).As well as redistributing food Felix's Kitchen in Bow, East London, uses donated fresh produce to create circa 1,300 ""ready meals"" a day. Supervised by professional chefs the kitchen produces an ever changing menu of five or six different packaged meals daily, including vegetarian and vegan options. The Felix Project was founded in July 2016, in memory of Felix Byam Shaw who died suddenly from meningitis. It started with a van and a depot in West London."
 Work ,,"A new depot in North London opened in November 2017. In 2018, weekly food deliveries to primary schools started with Stanhope Primary School, and a green scheme for cyclists and walkers to collect and deliver food in a courier bag. The London Evening Standard and The Independent's 2017 Christmas Appeal raised £1,049,896 for the Felix Project's Help a Hungry Child Programme to establish 'market stalls' in primary schools, to help channel surplus food from suppliers directly to those young children and their families who are in the greatest need."
 Work ,,"The aim is to ensure no child in any primary school supported by the charity goes hungry.56 Team Felix runners took part in The Big Half, London’s new half-marathon. Collaboration with top London chefs aims to raise the profile of high-quality gastronomy and show the value of surplus food to encourage social inclusion. This includes partnering with Refettorio Felix at St Cuthbert’s Centre, a community kitchen founded by chef Massimo Bottura, and being the official charity partner for London Food Month which was attended by more than 100,000 people."
 Work ,,"The Felix Project is funded by donations from individuals, corporate supporters and the Felix Byam Shaw Foundation. The Evening Standard’s Food for London campaign had The Felix Project as its flagship charity. Corporate sponsors donate vans, fridges and contribute to running costs. Crowdfunding helped raise funds for a new depot in North London.Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs awarded funding in the first round of their Food Waste Fund, which was awarded to redistribution organisations to substantially reduce food waste from businesses."
