 Practices Eligible for Funding ,,The EQIP covers up to 75 percent of costs incurred and 100 percent of income foregone for implementing eligible conservation practices for awardees. There are a variety of conservation practices that are eligible for funding under EQIP.
 Practices Eligible for Funding , Grazing ,"Managed rotational grazing, a method of livestock production in which animals are moved between pastures in order to let pastureland rest, is included as an eligible practice under EQIP. Specifically, the most common managed grazing practices that may receive funding include: design plans and identification of infrastructure and materials needs such as fencing, planting, and water systems; prescribed grazing systems that improve or maintain water quality, plant communities, watersheds, or wildlife cover; and mechanical treatment to improve soil and plant conditions. At the national level, 50 percent of EQIP funding is reserved for livestock operations."

 History ,,"The contamination that makes up The Plume was discovered in 1993 during construction of the Retirement Systems of Alabama (RSA) Tower energy plant. In the late 1990s the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) became involved, and in 2000 the EPA proposed that the Capital City Plume Site be put on the National Priorities List (NPL). Although proposed, Capital City Plume never made it onto the NPL because the Alliance, an organization developed by the city, agreed to address the site effectively and in a timely manner.The first step the city took was in developing the Alliance."
 History ,,"The Alliance is composed of governmental agencies including the City of Montgomery, Montgomery County, Montgomery Water Works and Sanitary Sewer Board, the State of Alabama, and the Montgomery Advertiser who will be working in accordance with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management requirements. The Alliance has agreed to pay back 2.6 million dollars to the EPA, which is part of what was spent investigating the area over nearly 20 years.Through testing, the EPA named the Montgomery Advertiser and the state agencies as potential responsible parties."
 History ,,"Independent tests from Montgomery Advertiser's consultant had different conclusions than the EPA and pointed to nearby gas stations and dry cleaners as the culprits of the environmental contamination. Their President and Publisher stated that regardless of who was responsible, the issue and focus now had to be on the cleanup and the bettering of the city environmentally."
 History ,,"The city of Montgomery accepted public comments for a period of 30 days following their initial acceptance of the terms from the EPA, and during those 30 days, from July 30, 2015, to August 31, 2015, the comments would be considered in any modifications or amendments to the agreement. From 2008 to 2010 the United States Geological Surveys' Alabama and South Carolina Water Science Centers conducted tests on numerous things in and around the site of the plume in downtown Montgomery."
 History ,,"Contaminants had been found in groundwater, so the tests were conducted to reveal where the source of contamination was stemming from as well as the pathways the contamination was taking underground. Additionally, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) aimed to discover when the contamination occurred. In order to find answers to these questions the USGS conducted many tests and methods of sampling including but not limited to sampling of creek water, ground water, trees, and soil."
 History ,,"The USGS also looked at how the land was historically used so that a correlation could be drawn between locations of high concentrations of chemicals and the source polluters. Scientists used passive-diffusion bag samplers to collect pore water from Cypress Creek and groundwater from other locations, which would provide data and concentration levels of the contaminants in the creek. Scientists also took tissue samples from trees that were growing along the Alabama River, Cypress Creek, and downtown Montgomery so that the analysis and data could give a better idea of the big picture and the true reach of the pollution."
 History ,,"The tests concluded that the aquifer residing below the Capital City Plume site was contaminated with perchloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) and that the contamination was likely caused by the commercial printing industry that resided in downtown Montgomery in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The USGS scientists also concluded that the contamination likely was attributed to wastewater containing chlorinated solvents that had gotten into stormwater systems, thus polluting the aquifer. As part of the remediation action, the City of Montgomery planted two acres of poplar trees, which take up and break down contaminants from shallow groundwater through their roots."
 History ,,"The Alliance has submitted a work plan to complete the assessment of the plume area. During the years of analysis and cleanup, the downtown area has remained open for business and redevelopment. This includes the building of a new Riverfront Amphitheater, a Conference Complex, and parks and attracting new retail outlets, housing, offices, and industry.

 Train derailment ,,"On May 12, 1989, at 7:36 a.m. a 6-locomotive/69-car Southern Pacific freight train (SP 7551 East, computer symbol 1 MJLBP-11) that was transporting trona, lost control while descending Cajon Pass, derailed on an elevated curve and plowed into a residential area on Duffy Street. The location is just northeast of where the 210 Foothill Freeway crosses the Lytle Creek wash. The conductor, head-end brakeman, and two residents were killed in the wreck. Seven houses on the street immediately next to the tracks were demolished by the wreck, as were the lead locomotives and all of the freight cars."
 Train derailment ,,"Clerks in Mojave had miscalculated the weight of the train, while the engineer and crew at the head end were unaware that one of the rear helper engines had inoperative dynamic brakes. Hence there was not enough dynamic braking force available to maintain control of train speed during the descent. When the helper engineer realized that the train speed was not being adequately controlled, he made an emergency brake application, which deactivated dynamic braking, resulting in a runaway condition."
 Train derailment ,,"The train reached a speed of about 110 miles per hour (180 km/h) before derailing on an elevated 35 miles per hour (56 km/h) curve next to Duffy Street, sending the head-end locomotives and several cars off the high railroad bed and into houses on the street below, completely demolishing them. Data from the locomotives' ""black boxes"" (event recorders) showed that the third head end locomotive's dynamic brakes were not functioning at all, although the sound of the cooling fans misled crews into believing dynamic braking was functional."
 Train derailment ,,"It was also determined after the wreck that the engineer operating the helper locomotives knew of the faulty dynamic brakes on one of his units, but did not communicate that information to the head end crew. The combination of weight miscalculation, poor communication and faulty brake equipment resulted in a total train weight that was too great to adequately control on the down grade. Once dynamic braking had been defeated by the helper engineer's emergency brake application the enormous weight of the heavily loaded cars caused rapid acceleration that could not be resisted solely by mechanical braking."
 Train derailment ,,"The train catapulted from the 35 mph curve next to Duffy Street, at 110 mph, scattering locomotives and cars, as well as lading. It was composited by an SD40T-2, two SD45Rs, and an SD45T-2 on the head end, an SD40T-2 and SD45R on the helper end, and 69 hopper cars loaded with trona."

 Train derailment , Train and helper crews of Southern Pacific 7551 East ,"as follows: Frank Holland, Engineer (age 33) Everett Crown,† Conductor (age 35) Allan Riess,† Brakeman on 3rd locomotive (age 43) Lawrence Hill, Engineer on helper unit 7443 (age 42) Robert Waterbury, Brakeman on helper unit 7443 (age 57)(†=Killed in the wreck.) Killed in the wreck were Conductor Crown (fatally crushed in the nose of unit SP 8278) and Brakeman Riess (fatally crushed in the cab of unit SP 7549), along with two young boys, Jason Thompson (age 10 years) and Tyson White (age 7 years), who were crushed and asphyxiated when the train destroyed one of the houses on Duffy Street."
 Train derailment , Train and helper crews of Southern Pacific 7551 East ,"Engineer Holland remained in his seat at the control stand in unit SP 8278 at the head of the train, and suffered several cracked ribs and a punctured lung. However, he was able to crawl out of his wrecked locomotive and was helped down by eyewitnesses on the scene. Engineer Hill and Brakeman Waterbury, who were in the helper locomotives, received minor injuries. Buried six feet underground alongside the track is a 14-inch high-pressure petroleum pipeline operated by Calnev Pipeline. The pipeline was marked with stakes during cleanup to avoid the risk of it being accidentally damaged."
 Train derailment , Train and helper crews of Southern Pacific 7551 East ,"Pipeline officials remained on site as safety observers during the cleanup of the rail cars, but not during the cleanup of the trona material. Service on the track where the derailment happened was restored four days after the crash."
 Train derailment , Train and helper crews of Southern Pacific 7551 East ,"Thirteen days after the train wreck on May 25, 1989, at 8:05 a.m., shortly after eyewitnesses heard a train pass through the derailment site, the pipeline burst at a point on the curve where the derailment happened, showering the neighborhood with gasoline, which ignited into a large fire that burned for close to seven hours and emitted a plume of flames three hundred feet into the air. By the time the fire was out, it had fatally burned two people, and destroyed eleven more houses and 21 cars."
 Train derailment , Train and helper crews of Southern Pacific 7551 East ,"Of the houses destroyed, five were directly across the street from houses that had been destroyed in the derailment, while another was the only house on the track side of Duffy Street to have been spared damage during the derailment. Four more houses received moderate smoke and fire damage, while three others had only smoke damage. The total property damage was US$14.3 million (equivalent to $33.8 million in 2022), with more of this damage resulting from the fire than from the train derailment, although there were more fatalities from the derailment."
 Train derailment , Train and helper crews of Southern Pacific 7551 East ,"Attempts to have the Calnev pipeline kept shut off after its failure were unsuccessful.Many residents received settlements from Southern Pacific and/or Calnev and moved after this disaster. The plots on the south side of Duffy Street closest to the rail line were rezoned as open space by the city so they would not be rebuilt. Other nearby plots which could be redeveloped sat empty for years, though as of 2016, at least three houses have been rebuilt there."
 Train derailment , Train and helper crews of Southern Pacific 7551 East ,"Southern Pacific also changed its cargo weight procedures, which required that the clerks assume that every freight car on every train was carrying the maximum load it was designed to carry if the submitted paperwork did not indicate a weight. By assuming the maximum weight of the train, that would guarantee that the dispatcher would assign at least the minimum number of locomotives needed to ensure that the train would have enough braking capacity needed to keep the train under control on steep grades."
 Train derailment , Train and helper crews of Southern Pacific 7551 East ,"Seven years after the accident, Southern Pacific was bought up by Union Pacific, which still runs trains over the rails where the derailment happened."
 Aftermath , Disposal of the train's equipment ,"All four of the locomotives at the front of the train (SP 8278, SP 7551, SP 7549 and SP 9340) were damaged beyond repair. They were sold for parts to Precision National and scrapped at the crash site. Both helper units derailed, but were still operable. Unit SP 8317 was sold to Precision National, repaired, then resold to Helm Leasing for continued service. It was scrapped in 2013. Unit SP 7443 was repaired and repainted by SP and returned to service."
 Aftermath , Disposal of the train's equipment ,"It was finally retired on March 17, 2000 and sold to National Railway Equipment Company, who rebuilt it with 5′6″ gauge trucks for MRS Logística (in Brazil) #5313. All 69 hopper cars were destroyed and scrapped at the crash site. As a result of this and other runaway incidents involving locomotives with dynamic braking, the Federal Railroad Administration reversed its mandate that dynamic braking be disabled when train brakes are placed in emergency. The mandate now is that they must all remain functional."
 Investigation , Part 1a: Incorrect train weight ,"Much of the NTSB's investigation into the two disasters was focused on the activities surrounding the derailment. SP MJLBP1-11 was carrying trona that had been mined and loaded onto the freight cars for shipment to a buyer. The shipment would move by rail to the Port of Los Angeles, then by ship to Colombia, South America. This would be the second such shipment."
 Investigation , Part 1a: Incorrect train weight ,"The buyer had purchased 6,900 tons of trona; thus the mining company, Lake Minerals, contracted for 69 100-ton coal hopper cars (which had a combination of D&RGW and SP reporting marks), which were to be loaded by an outside contractor at Rosamond. When the mining company turned in the final contract to the clerk (Thomas Blair) for the bill of lading, they had not filled in any weight, under the assumption that the railroad would know that they had filled the 100-ton cars to capacity."
 Investigation , Part 1a: Incorrect train weight ,"The clerk filled in the bill of lading as 60 tons per hopper car, going by a visual comparison of 100 tons of coal. As a result, the train was listed as weighing about 6,151 tons total (2,011 tons from the freight cars themselves, 4,140 tons of cargo), significantly lighter than its actual weight (Warren, 3). At 9:00 p.m. on May 11, a three-man crew consisting of Frank Holland, an engineer; Everett Crown, a conductor; and Allan Riess, a brakeman, was brought on duty at SP's Bakersfield yard."
 Investigation , Part 1a: Incorrect train weight ,"They were transported by company van to Mojave to take charge of a three-unit set of locomotives, consisting of SP 7551, SP 7549 (both EMD SD45R units) and SP 9340 (an EMD SD45T-2). While at Mojave, the crew obtained the necessary paperwork for their train, including a Car and Tonnage Profile (a printout generated by SP's TOPS computer system that showed, among other things, the assumed train weight of 6,151 tons). Upon boarding the locomotives, it was discovered that the head unit, #7551, was dead and could not be started."
 Investigation , Part 1a: Incorrect train weight ,"The crew was then instructed to take unit SP 8278 (an EMD SD40T-2 ""Tunnel Motor"") from another consist and add it to theirs, ahead of the dead 7551. The crew departed Mojave at 12:15 a.m. on May 12, and headed south (railroad direction east) approximately three miles to Fleta, where they were to pick up the 69 freight cars."
 Investigation , Part 1a: Incorrect train weight ,"Due to maintenance equipment being parked on the track at the south end of the Fleta siding, it was necessary for the train crew to pick up the cars from the north end, take them back to Mojave and run around them, before heading south to Palmdale, where it was originally intended to pick up an additional helper that would be placed on the rear of the train to aid in braking after cresting Cajon Pass."
 Investigation , Part 1a: Incorrect train weight ,"After a shift change in the train dispatcher's office, the new dispatcher correctly recalculated the tonnage of the train to be approximately 8,900 tons, based on his previous experience with these types of moves. Braking ability diminishes exponentially for every degree of grade – at a 2.2% grade, the dynamic brakes of one fully operational locomotive was capable of maintaining the speed of 1,700 to 1,800 tons of weight (either in freight cars or freight) at a speed of 25 miles per hour (40 km/h)."
 Investigation , Part 1a: Incorrect train weight ,"Dynamic braking ability is most effective near a speed of 25 miles per hour (40 km/h) and diminishes if the train travels slower or faster than this optimal speed, so engineers try to maintain speeds between 25–30 miles per hour (40–48 km/h) on steep grades."
 Investigation , Part 1a: Incorrect train weight ,"The dispatcher determined that they would need the dynamic brakes of 5.23 functional engines (6 total) to maintain this optimal speed between 25 and 30 miles per hour (40 and 48 km/h), so picking up only the one additional helper locomotive at Palmdale, as originally planned, would not provide sufficient dynamic braking effort for the 2.2% grade on the west side of Cajon Pass where the derailment happened, so instead of adding the single unit at Palmdale, the dispatcher ordered a two-unit helper set dispatched from the helper pool in West Colton, California. Consequently, at 1:30 a.m."
 Investigation , Part 1a: Incorrect train weight ,"on May 12, a crew consisting of Lawrence Hill, an engineer, and Robert Waterbury, a brakeman (acting in a position known as a ""lookout"") was brought on duty at West Colton and transported by company van to Dike (located at Devore), where they boarded a two-unit helper locomotive consisting of units SP #7443 (an EMD SD45R) and SP 8317 (another EMD SD40T-2 Tunnel Motor). Their instructions were to first help a northbound train (timetable westward) up the hill to Oban, then bring MJLBP-11 back down Cajon Pass to West Colton."
 Investigation , Part 1b: Lack of dynamic braking power ,"The two critical factors in this runaway and subsequent derailment were (1) the incorrect train tonnage provided to the crew, and (2) the lack of fully operative dynamic brakes on all but two of the locomotives between the head-end and helper locomotives. Each hopper car had wheels that were equipped with an ordinary air brake. Critical parts of the air brakes consist of metal shoes that create friction by pressing against the wheel treads when the air brakes are activated. The slower a wheel moves, the more easily friction can induce slowing traction instead of heat."
 Investigation , Part 1b: Lack of dynamic braking power ,"The faster a wheel moves, the more difficult friction is converted to braking power versus heat. Thus, air brakes work optimally when traveling at speeds under 25 miles per hour (40 km/h) as this is the speed at which traction is obtained more than heat via the input of friction between the shoes and the wheels. The air brakes on MJLBP-11's fully loaded hopper cars (100 tons each on a 2.2% grade) had only a limited effect on the braking potential of the train, becoming exponentially weaker and hotter as the speed of the train increased."
 Investigation , Part 1b: Lack of dynamic braking power ,"The second locomotive in the head-end set, SP 7551, since it was dead-in-tow, did not have operative dynamic brakes, just air brakes. The event recorder downloaded from unit SP 7549 (the third locomotive), showed that it was producing traction current in motoring but no current in dynamic braking. The dynamic brakes of the fourth locomotive, SP 9340, operated sporadically and were of limited use. Unit SP 8317 (of the two-unit helper engine set coupled to the rear of the train) also did not have an operative dynamic brake."
 Investigation , Part 1b: Lack of dynamic braking power ,"Thus, among the four locomotives in front and the set of helpers on the end, only SP 8278 at the front of the train and SP 7443 at the back of the train had fully functioning dynamic brakes. This information was not passed on to the train dispatcher."
 Investigation , Part 1b: Lack of dynamic braking power ,"The train engineer knew only that the second unit of the head-end consist (SP 7551) had no brakes, but believed he had more than sufficient dynamic brakes to maintain the speed of 6,151 tons (as was still listed in the cargo manifest) because 6,151 tons would only require the dynamic braking effort of five engines."
 Investigation , Part 1b: Lack of dynamic braking power ,"With a true weight of 8,900 tons, however, the train would have needed the functioning dynamic brakes of at least six or seven engines (with moderate dependence on the air brakes), or five engines (with a heavy input from the air brakes) in order to maintain control. As soon as the train crested the apex of the grade at Hiland and started downgrade on the south side of Cajon Pass, it became apparent to Holland at the head end that he was having trouble controlling the speed of the train."
 Investigation , Part 1b: Lack of dynamic braking power ,"When he realized that the train was gathering too much speed, he did all he could to control the train speed using the train's air brakes and the dynamic brakes of the lead locomotives, and asked the helper engine's engineer to do as much as he could to help also, not knowing that he had only one working dynamic brake in his set."
 Investigation , Part 1b: Lack of dynamic braking power ,"As a last attempt to stop the train, the helper engineer initiated an emergency brake application from his helper locomotive, but this ended up disabling all of the dynamic brakes on the train, allowing the train to pick up speed. After the activation of the emergency brake, the only brakes which were operational were the air brakes, which were now melting from the friction and heat."
 Investigation , Part 1b: Lack of dynamic braking power ,"When the NTSB investigators arrived at the crash site (about twelve hours after the accident), they observed that the wheels had gotten so hot that they had started to expand off the wheel axles by the time they left the rails.The train was traveling at a calculated speed of 110 miles per hour (180 km/h) when it entered a four-degree curve just north of the Highland Avenue overpass which had a maximum authorized speed of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h) and derailed, plowing into the houses on the outside of the curve."
 Investigation , Part 1b: Lack of dynamic braking power ,"All but one of the houses on the side of Duffy Street nearer the tracks were destroyed. The one house on that side of the street that was spared damage during the derailment was destroyed in the pipeline rupture. Six hundred and eighty feet of track were also destroyed in the wreck. The NTSB report determined that if the train had started down the hill at a speed lower than 15 miles per hour (24 km/h), it might have been possible for the crew to regain control of their train and brakes."
 Investigation , Part 1b: Lack of dynamic braking power ,"It was also discovered that the SP's engineer training program did not have any material on how to regain control of a runaway train, and the railroad's oversight on mountain operations was inadequate. The report stated that the derailment was inevitable due to the number of unfortunate circumstances that happened during the trip. The engineers weren't found to be at fault at all, as they acted within reason."
 Investigation , Part 2: Undetected pipeline damage ,"The initial inspections of specific portions of the pipeline found no damage from the wreck, and so they deemed it safe to recharge the pipeline with product at full pressure. In particular, as this pipeline supplied Las Vegas, Calnev was under pressure to quickly resume the flow of product, and a San Bernardino resident later remarked that serving Las Vegas was worth more than everything in their California town. The pipeline operators monitored the initial flow in the pipeline, and as there was no leakage, everything was assumed to be fine."
 Investigation , Part 2: Undetected pipeline damage ,"After Calnev's initial inspection and product refill, cleanup of the train wreckage began. The hoppers were removed first, a process which took two days. On May 15, the locomotives were removed and the houses that had been damaged were also demolished, and 680 feet (210 m) of track was rebuilt. An excavator was then brought in to remove trona spilled from the freight cars, starting on May 16, the same day that SP resumed service on the track through the crash site, and ending on May 19, six days before the rupture."
 Investigation , Part 2: Undetected pipeline damage ,"Despite stakes being placed along the pipeline's route to show where it was to the crews cleaning up the spilled trona, the cleanup nonetheless caused undetected damage to the pipeline. NTSB investigators found gashes that were determined to have been left by a backhoe cleaning up the spilled cargo. Over time, these gashes caused the integrity of the pipeline to weaken and eventually rupture. During cleanup, Calnev only inspected short segments of the pipeline – generally around places where train wreckage had landed on top of the pipe. Other short excavations discovered other debris, including bogies from the hoppers."
 Investigation , Part 2: Undetected pipeline damage ,"They did not carry out an excavation of the pipeline through the entire length of the derailment site for a further inspection, or, a hydrostatic test, either of which, if done, would have found the damage and prevented the rupture. Immediately after the rupture, the pipeline control operators detected a sudden change in pumping pressure (indicating possible rupture or severe leakage) in the area, but failed to take immediate action to stop the flow of product."
 Investigation , Part 2: Undetected pipeline damage ,"Additionally, the stop-and-check valves downstream from the rupture failed to close, allowing product to flow back down the pipe through Cajon Pass, which strengthened the intensity and duration of the fire. The valves were already defective at the time of the derailment, and this was not rectified in the two weeks between the derailment and the rupture. During inspection of the pipeline after the rupture, more debris from one of the wrecked locomotives was discovered near the point of rupture."
 Investigation , Part 2: Undetected pipeline damage ,"At the point of the rupture, the pipeline was only buried 2+1⁄2 feet (0.76 m) underneath the ground, much closer to the surface than the pipeline had been at the time of the derailment. The disaster was featured in ""Runaway Train"", a Season 3 (2005) Crash Scene Investigation episode of the Canadian TV series Mayday. For broadcasters that do not use the series name Mayday, this is one of three Season 3 episodes labeled as Crash Scene Investigation spin-offs, examining marine or rail disasters. The dramatization was broadcast with the title ""Unstoppable Train"" in the United States."

 Explosion and fire ,,"At 6:11 pm PDT on September 9, 2010, a huge explosion occurred in the Crestmoor residential neighborhood of San Bruno, near Skyline Boulevard and San Bruno Avenue. This caused a fire, which quickly engulfed nearby houses. Emergency responders from San Bruno and nearby cities soon arrived at the scene and evacuated surrounding neighborhoods. Strong winds fanned the flames, hampering fire fighting efforts. The blaze was fed by a ruptured gas pipe, and large clouds of smoke soared into the sky."
 Explosion and fire ,,"It took 60 to 90 minutes to shut off the gas after the explosion, according to San Bruno Fire Chief Dennis Haag. The explosion and resulting fire leveled either 35 or 37 houses and damaged at least 8 more, according to conflicting sources. Three of the damaged houses, deemed uninhabitable, were torn down the following December. About 200 firefighters battled the eight alarm fire that resulted from the explosions."
 Explosion and fire ,,"The explosion excavated an asymmetric crater 167 feet (51 m) long, 26 feet (7.9 m) wide and 40 feet (12 m) deep along the sidewalk of Glenview Drive in front of 1701 Earl Avenue (a corner house), but many of the destroyed homes were eastward in the 1600 block of Claremont Drive. The fire continued to burn for several hours after the initial explosion. The explosion compromised a water main and required firefighters to truck in water from outside sources. Firefighters were assisted by residents who dragged fire hoses nearly 4,000 feet (1,200 m) to working hydrants."
 Explosion and fire ,,"Ordinary citizens drove injured people and burn victims to the hospital. Mutual aid responded from all over the Bay Area, including the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection who sent 25 fire engines, four airtankers, two air attack planes, and one helicopter. The fire was only fifty percent contained by 10 pm PDT and continued to burn until about 11:40 am PDT the next day.As of September 29, 2010, the death toll was eight people."
 Explosion and fire ,,"Among the eight deaths was 20-year-old Jessica Morales, who was with her boyfriend, Joseph Ruigomez, at the epicenter of the fire (his home) on the corner of Earl Ave. Despite his proximity to the epicenter of the fire, Ruigomez survived but spent nearly five months recovering in the Saint Francis Memorial Hospital Burn Center. Two other people at the Claremont address close to the explosion were among those killed: Jacqueline Greig, 44, and her daughter Janessa Greig, 13. Greig worked for the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), in a small unit that advocates for consumer rights pertaining to natural gas regulations."
 Explosion and fire ,,"She had spent part of the summer evaluating PG&E's expansion plans and investment proposals to replace out-of-date pipelines. Also killed in the blast were Lavonne Bullis, 82, Greg Bullis, 50, and Will Bullis, 17."
 Response , San Bruno ,"A Red Cross shelter was set up at the Veterans Memorial Recreation Center in San Bruno, and the Blood Centers of the Pacific issued an emergency appeal for blood donations. Some people were evacuated to Tanforan and Bayhill Shopping Centers. All elementary schools in the San Bruno Park Elementary School District, as well as Parkside Junior High, were closed on September 10. However, Capuchino High School remained open. Some residents who were evacuated from their homes were allowed to return to those undamaged on Sunday, September 12."
 Response , Pacific Gas and Electric Company ,"The Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is the owner of the pipeline. On September 10, 2010, PG&E's president, Christopher Johns, said the company was not able to approach the source of the explosion to investigate the cause. An official press release issued by PG&E on September 10 reported the pipe was a 30-inch (76 cm) steel transmission line."
 Response , Pacific Gas and Electric Company ,"Shares of PG&E stock fell eight percent on the Friday after the explosion, reducing the company's market capitalization by $1.57 billion.PG&E also reduced their operating pressures by 20 percent after investigations revealed the pipeline may have been improperly installed.After the San Bruno pipeline failure, PG&E was required to re-evaluate how it determines the maximum operating pressure for some 1,800 miles of pipeline throughout its system. Specifically, the CPUC asked PG&E officials to show their lines had been tested or examined in a way that could prove the pipeline can withstand the current maximum operating pressure."
 Response , Pacific Gas and Electric Company ,"At the March 15, 2011 deadline for this report, PG&E was unable to provide documentation for details of some of its gas transmission pipelines.In response to the disaster and a subsequent decision (D.11-06-017) by the CPUC, PG&E unveiled a plan in August 2011 to modernize and enhance safety of its gas transmission operations over several years, including automation of over 200 valves, strength-testing over 700 miles (1,100 km) of pipe, replacing 185 miles (298 km), and upgrading another 200 miles (320 km) or so to allow in-line inspection. The plan was divided into two phases."
 Response , Pacific Gas and Electric Company ,"The first phase, scheduled to end in 2014, targeted pipeline segments in urban areas, those not built to modern standards, and those that had not been strength-tested. Project funding of $769 million was the subject of a PG&E application (R.11-02-019) for a three-year increase in gas rates starting January 2012.On November 6, 2011, an explosion occurred near Woodside, California during strength testing of PG&E pipelines. The explosion caused a mudslide in the area; however, no casualties were reported."
 Response , California state government ,"Lieutenant Governor Abel Maldonado made a state of emergency declaration and signed an executive order to provide aid to victims. State regulators ordered PG&E to survey all natural gas lines the company controls in California. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger visited the site several days later, after returning from a trade mission in Asia."
 Response , Federal government ,"U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier called the devastation ""a very serious crisis"" and was asking Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to declare it a national disaster area."
 Response , Use of technology ,"The San Bruno explosion was notable for the fact that local technology companies such as Cisco Systems and Google dispatched their emergency response teams to provide emergency communications and enhanced mapping information at the request of responders at the scene. Coordinated through the nonprofit InSTEDD (Innovative Support to Emergencies, Diseases, and Disasters), with support from the Carnegie Mellon University Disaster Management Initiative, a number of unaffiliated technology volunteers were requested to support many of the GIS (Geographic Information Systems) response efforts, coordinated through the Planning Section Chief."
 Response , Use of technology ,"San Bruno Police declared the area a crime scene to determine if foul play was involved. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) began an investigation into the cause of the explosion. During the days prior to the explosion, some residents reported smelling natural gas in the area. A source within PG&E reported a break in natural gas line number 132 caused the explosion. At the time of the explosion, the pressure within that part of the pipeline was 386–386.4 psi (2.661–2.664 MPa)."
 Response , Use of technology ,"Although this was 11 psi (0.076 MPa) greater than PG&E's maximum rated operating pressure for that section of the pipeline, it was still 14 psi (0.097 MPa) below PG&E's specified maximum allowable rating of 400 psi (2.8 MPa). The gas line is a large 30-inch (76 cm) steel pipe."
 Response , Use of technology ,"NTSB vice chairman Christopher Hart said at a briefing that the segment of pipe that blew out onto the street was 28 feet (8.5 m) long, the explosion sent that piece of pipe about 100 feet (30 m) and the blast created a crater 167 feet (51 m) long and 26 feet (7.9 m) wide, though the NTSB Pipeline Accident Report would later size the crater to be 72 feet (22 m) long and 26 feet (7.9 m) wide."
 Response , Use of technology ,"He said that an inspection of the severed pipe chunk revealed that it was made of several smaller sections that had been welded together and that a seam ran its length. The presence of the welds did not necessarily indicate the pipe had been repaired, he said. Newer pipelines are usually manufactured into the shape needed for these applications, rather than having multiple weaker welded sections that could potentially leak or break.In January 2011, federal investigators reported that they found numerous defective welds in the pipeline. The thickness of the pipe varied, and some welds did not penetrate the pipes completely."
 Response , Use of technology ,"As PG&E increased the pressure in the pipes to meet growing energy demand, the defective welds were further weakened until their failure."
 Response , Use of technology ,"As the pipeline was installed in 1956, modern testing methods such as X-rays were not available to detect the problem at that time.The NTSB held a 3-day public hearing on March 1 through 3, 2011, to gather additional facts for the ongoing investigation of the pipeline rupture and explosion.Parties to the public hearing included: Pacific Gas & Electric California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) The City of San Bruno International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245The NTSB also published call logs from the Milpitas PG&E gas terminal to a gas control center."
 Response , Use of technology ,"An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) replacement was started at the Milpitas terminal several hours before the San Bruno explosion.It was revealed that PG&E had done pipeline replacement work on Line 132 along parts of the San Andreas Fault zone, near this area, to reduce the likelihood of the pipeline failing from an earthquake."
 Response , Use of technology ,"However, the replacement was stopped short of the area that failed in 2010.On January 13, 2012, an independent audit from the State of California issued a report stating that PG&E had illegally diverted over $100 million from a fund used for safety operations, and instead used it for executive compensation and bonuses."
 Litigation , Private party ,"Through more than 20 law firms, over 100 plaintiffs have sued Pacific Gas and Electric and/or its parent, PG&E Corporation, in the Superior Courts of California in over 70 separate lawsuits. Virtually all were filed in the local state court, the Superior Court of California for the County of San Mateo. All the cases were consolidated and transferred to Judge Steven L. Dylina on March 4, 2011, and designated as Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding (JCCP) No. 4648, PG&E ""San Bruno Fire"" Cases. On June 3, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated Master Complaint."
 Litigation , Private party ,"On July 5, 2011, PG&E's lawyers filed their Answer to the Master Complaint. A week later, the San Francisco Chronicle ran a front-page story attacking the defendants for invoking certain routine defenses in their answer, like state-of-the-art and comparative negligence.In July 2012, the plaintiffs lodged a deposition in San Mateo County Superior Court claiming that PG&E management ignored employee concerns about GIS data inaccuracies that impeded inspection of the pipeline.In September 2013, PG&E settled the claims of 347 victims. PG&E had previously settled with 152 victims; the additional settlements brought the total payment to $565 million for 499 victims."
 Litigation , Private party ,"Two victims' lawsuits remained after the settlement, but newspapers later reported the $565 million figure as the final settlement for all victim claims. PG&E stated in its 2015 annual report that it had paid $558 million in third-party claims, and $92 million in legal costs, and received $515 million from insurance."
 Litigation , State of California ,"In October 2012, public hearings on the San Bruno pipeline blast at the CPUC were suspended for state regulators and PG&E to strike a deal about the fines. Rene Morales, mother of Jessica Morales who was burned alive and one of eight people that was killed in the fire requested that California Governor Jerry Brown appoint a new president of the California PUC. Also in October 2012, former Senator George J. Mitchell was chosen to lead talks in the settlement of fines in the explosion."
 Litigation , State of California ,"In December 2012 the CPUC decided that 55% of the long term costs for PG&E pipeline inspection and safety upgrades of $229 million will be borne by electricity rate payers.On September 16, 2014, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Carol Brown, the chief of staff for the president of the CPUC, had communicated with PG&E executives to help move litigation to judges they expected would be friendly to PG&E's side. As of October 2014 the judge shopping scandal is under federal investigation."
 Litigation , State of California ,"In 2018, the CPUC fined PG&E $92.5 million for improper communication with CPUC commissioners and staff.On April 9, 2015, the Public Utilities Commission fined PG&E $1.6 billion."
 Litigation , Federal ,"On April 1, 2014, PG&E was indicted by a federal grand jury in United States District Court for the Northern District of California for multiple violations of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 relating to its record keeping and pipeline ""integrity management"" practices. An additional indictment was issued by the grand jury on July 29, 2014, charging the company with obstruction of justice for lying to the NTSB regarding its pipeline testing policy, bringing the total number of counts in the indictment to 28."
 Litigation , Federal ,"Under the new indictment, the company could be fined as much as $1.3 billion, based on profit associated with the alleged misconduct, in addition to $2.5 billion for state regulatory violations.On January 21, 2017, PG&E was fined $3 million and ordered to perform 10,000 hours of community service for criminal actions of violating the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act and for obstruction of justice. In addition, it must institute a compliance and ethics monitoring program and spend up to $3 million to ""publicize its criminal conduct""."
 Litigation , Federal ,These actions were imposed after the company was found guilty by a federal jury in August 2016 of six of the twelve charges against the company in US District Court.
 Litigation , Shareholders ,"In 2017, PG&E settled a shareholder class action lawsuit alleging ""gross mismanagement"" by agreeing to have its insurance company pay PG&E $90 million, and to budget $32 million for safety and governance improvements. Brigham McCown, the former head for the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, called for the creation of a national commission to examine the problems surrounding high-pressure fuel pipelines that have been built in residential areas."
 Litigation , Shareholders ,"McCown says it often takes an ""incident like this one to force change."" He also suggested installing a ""no man's land"" around some pipelines in hopes of preventing another disaster.On September 9, 2012, a memorial to the victims was unveiled in the San Bruno City Park.

 History of regulation ,,"Up until 1965, there was no federal legislation regulating the disposal of solid and hazardous waste in the United States. The Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) was passed by Congress in 1965. A major amendment to SWDA was the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), passed by Congress in 1976. The RCRA gives the EPA the ability to regulate the flow of hazardous waste for the entire lifetime of the product, including development, transport, and disposal."
 History of regulation ,,"In 1986, a cargo vessel carrying 14,000 tons of toxic waste left Philadelphia and traveled around the world for more than five months continually being turned away from areas where it attempted to dump its contents. Eventually, much of the toxic waste was dumped into the Indian Ocean. This event sparked some of the current efforts to regulate the flows of electronic waste and ensure the health and safety of the global environment. The U.S. has not enacted a federal law to regulate the domestic recycling of e-waste, but, some states are implementing policies to address its increasing accumulation."
 History of regulation ,,"When electronic products stop functioning, they are either incinerated, landfilled, or recycled to salvage materials and protect public health and the environment by removing its toxic materials. Despite attempts to push federal e-waste bills forward, which stem as far back as the 1990s, US states have held the most legislative agency on e-waste. So far, 25 states have enacted legislation to regulate statewide e-waste recycling initiatives, which means 65% of the population must uphold their state's e-waste recycling policies."
 History of regulation ,,"Every state with e-waste regulation laws, expect Utah and California, use the Producer Responsibility approach to hold manufacturers accountable by making them fund e-waste recycling. But, because state e-waste laws vary, the effectiveness of the laws in regulating environmental and health harms can differ. Because the US has not ratified the Basel Convention on hazardous waste, the US can export e-waste to countries where the dismantling and recycling of e-waste are cheaper due to lax environmental and workplace regulations."
 History of regulation ,,"Because the US does not have federal or intergovernmental e-waste policies and electronics producers still manufacture products with hazardous materials, e-waste is oftentimes dismantled without strict regulations or compliance so substances like heavy metals, flame retardants, and plastics produce public health risks. Due to the unregulated nature of the informal recycling sector in developing countries, US e-waste handlers are exporting resources which could have detrimental effects on not only humans handling the e-waste, but also the environment in areas where the e-waste is exported."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"Electronic devices are combinations of hundreds of different types of materials; many of them are considered to be toxic when exposed to humans. Although present within the device, these toxic heavy metals have only been documented to become a health hazard once the device is broken down. The process of electrical device breakdown occurs in a variety of locations and settings (recycling sites, storage locations), yet becomes a prominent health hazard when broken down in domestic or international sites that do not have the correct equipment or recycling methods."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"When taken apart without proper recycling methods, tools, or protective wear, workers and residents become exposed to the toxic chemicals in the devices. E-waste negatively impacts health primarily through the exposure of heavy metal dioxins. Incinerating e-waste without proper workplace and environmental regulations poses a risk because it generates dioxins, which can cause cancer and plague the human body and environment for long periods of time. Moreover, open burning, a common practice in developing countries receiving e-waste, releases toxic fumes and dust that can be easily inhaled and effect nearby food sources and water bodies."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"In addition to direct exposure through open burning and dismantling, e-waste storages and landfills can result in leakage of dioxins into the natural surroundings area."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"These dioxins are able to permeate the soil and contaminate ground water and nearby vegetation; not only does ecological contamination negatively affect overall ecosystem function, but it is another method in which all living organisms' health risks increase dramatically.A few of these chemicals include: Flame retardants: Some flame retardants like Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs), which can be found in e-waste plastic to make electronic products more flame resistant, are emitted into the environment through e-waste dismantling and become dust and air. BFRs are one of the materials that are used in the making of circuit boards and plastic casings."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"BFRs, which are fat-soluble, bioaccumulate causing short-term effects, such as seizures and mountain sickness, and long-term effects, such as neurological disorders and endocrine disruption. PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers), a class of BFRs, interfere with brain development of animals and in the hormones associated with sexual development. Specifically birds near processing sites who often carry these compounds in their shell. Long Term exposure to this toxin can result in problems concerning learning capability and memory function. Because of their toxicity, electronic manufacturers are phasing out BFRs."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"Lead: One can be exposed to lead through inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact, which could produce short-term effects, such as nausea, vomiting, convulsions, coma, or even death, and long-term effects, such as anemia, abdominal pain, encephalopathy, and nephropathy. Metallic lead exists in the electrical circuit boards and lead oxide is a component of the cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and is used to connect the glass face plate with funnel sections. Lead can be found in lead-acid batteries, solders, and in televisions and monitors."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"Lead can leach from CRTs in landfill conditions, be released into the air through incineration, glass crushing, or high temperature processing. Similar to other toxins, lead can accumulate in the human body and biomass over a long period of time and can have damaging impacts on the nervous, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. Lead is found in such high quantities of electronic waste that in the United States, prison recycling programs were found to have 50 times the safe level set by the EPA."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"Also, in China, children living near electronic waste processing sites are recorded to have 3 times the safe level of lead in their blood. Cadmium: Cadmium is another metal, which is found in rechargeable batteries and ""phosphor"" coatings in older cathode ray tubes (CRTs). Cadmium compounds are used in a variety of electronic products, their functions ranging from stabilizing PVC formations to serving as wire insulators. Cadmium is a rare metal that is very toxic to plants, animals, and humans and is released into the air by incineration or poorly executed dismantling."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"When released, cadmium commonly accumulates in nearby crops, resulting in the additional exposure to humans and animals. Occupationally, fumes and dust containing cadmium compounds, a known carcinogen, can be inhaled directly and long term exposure results in kidney failure and bone problems. Heart disease, hypertension, and lung cancer are other health effects of cadmium inhalation. Cadmium exposure can lead to developmental issues involving motor skills, cognition, and learning. It can also potentially cause harm to kidneys. Mercury: Mercury is primarily utilized in the lighting mechanisms for flat-screen devices."
 Environmental and health effects , Hazardous materials in electronic devices ,"Mercury is a highly toxic chemical that can have fatal or severely damaging effects on the human central nervous system, especially during early development ages. As one of the most toxic and popular metals used in electronic products, mercury is an e-waste pollutant that can affect humans through inhalation and skin contact. It is known to cause short-term effects, such as vomiting, fever, and diarrhea, and in the long-term, can cause tremors, nausea, neuroasthenia, and hypersensitivity. Because of its widespread application, mercury can be found in common household products like batteries, fluorescent lamps, and thermostats."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,"One end-of-life treatment for electronic products is land-filling. In the US, some states have implemented landfill bans to accompany e-waste laws to reach collection goals and ensure e-waste is funneled through the proper channels. The danger in landfilling e-waste is that hazardous materials can leach out into groundwater or run off and pollute nearby water bodies. To address this, the US e-waste recycling industry is growing and continuing to implement robust workplace and environmental standards. In 2011, US e-waste recycling added an estimated $20.6 billion to the US economy and created roughly 45,000 jobs."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,"Still, e-waste, that contain toxic materials like lead and cadmium, can pose risks for US e-waste workers when processed manually. For instance, when processing cathode ray tubes (CRTs), which are found in television and computer monitors, workers use handheld tools like hammers that expose them to hazardous materials. As a result, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) investigate e-waste recycling facilities for health and environmental compliance. At e-waste recycling facilities, manually dismantling and sorting e-waste is the most popular technique and shredding or other automated separation techniques are secondary."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,"One risk associated with manual dismantling is the potential for lead and cadmium contamination. Lead can disperse throughout e-waste recycling facilities covering surfaces, worker's uniforms, and areas outside the production floor, which can result in ingestion or inhalation of lead. Because of this, federal regulatory bodies like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) state that e-waste recycling facilities must provide uniforms, showers, and laundry services for workers."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,"When facilities don't meet these protocols, lead and cadmium exposures can leave the production floor with workers and enter their personal vehicles or homes, which can adversely affect the health of family members.Federal Prison Industries (FPI), also known as UNICOR, a government corporation that employs federal prison inmates, started an electronic-waste recycling program in 1994. UNICOR, a large government contractor, produced over $765 million in sales in 2005 and has accepted contracts for recycling e-waste since 1997. UNICOR has developed e-waste recycling operations in 10 federal prisons."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,"In addition, in 2009, UNICOR had 1,000 incarcerated individuals processing about 40 million pounds of e-waste. Since its inception, the e-waste recycling program has faced scrutiny regarding its lax safety enforcement, and has been subject to multiple health and safety investigations. Additionally, prisoners participating in this program are not protected under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and since they are not considered employees, they cannot formally organize and are not protected to speak out about unsafe working conditions."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,"This lack of legal protection leads workers to continue to operate in unsafe conditions, with fears of being fired or sent to another prison. In addition, OSHA is not permitted to conduct surprise inspections, which undermines their ability to investigate workplace safety violations. The UNICOR facility in Atwater was shut down in 2002 after an air quality test found lead and cadmium levels exceeding the standards set by OSHA. Between 2002 and 2005, a series of renovations and safety measures were taken to comply with safety standards, but the effectiveness of these efforts in reducing worker exposure to toxicants was debated."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,"In 2010, a report from the Inspector General revealed that UNICOR was in violation of e-waste recycling standards. The report found that UNICOR failed to provide protective workplace equipment or proper tools to dismantle electronic products, which resulted in staff and incarcerated individuals being exposed to lead and cadmium above permissible levels. Moreover, unspecified amounts of e-waste processed by UNICOR were also shipped overseas. Additionally, illegal storage and disposal of toxic waste, such as glass and electronic dust debris by UNICOR facilities, can lead to contaminated soil, air and water from wind and rainwater runoff."
 Environmental and health effects , Domestic effects ,Health and safety negligence within the prison e-waste program may contribute to the accumulation of toxics in surrounding communities that are often made up of predominately low-income and minority residents.
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"Anywhere from 50 to 70% of e-waste collected in the US for recycling is exported to developing countries, which commonly ends up in the informal recycling sectors of Asia and West Africa. China receives the largest e-recycling volume, followed by India, Nigeria, and Ghana. Burning and dismantling e-waste is a main driver of atmospheric pollution and along with manual disassembly, is the primary workplace practice that results in exposure to hazardous materials. Oftentimes workers don't have the workplace protective equipment, like uniforms and face masks, necessary to shield them from the toxic fumes and dust."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"As the e-waste export chain generally ends in rural, unregulated, and technically illegal burning or dismantling sites, the workers are often subjected to extremely poor and hazardous conditions and are unable to unionize or speak out for better rights. High poverty levels correlate with illegal e-waste dumping sites, which is why most e-waste workers don't have the option to speak out and lose business or their jobs. In rural areas, contaminating compounds can accumulate in agricultural areas and be taken in by grazing animals."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"As the chemicals in question generally have a slow metabolic rate in animals, the compounds have a tendency to bioaccumulate in tissues and further contaminate humans through eggs, milk, and other edible products. In addition to human health hazards, contamination of water and soil can kill off entire populations, thus harming or destroying the local ecosystem. United States e-waste is primarily shipped to the following areas:China: In China, a variety of simple and complex e-waste disposal and disassembly processes take place."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"E-waste management practices include melting printed circuit boards to recover solder (surrounding plastics are burned off in the process), manual disassembly, and the use of acid to extract metals from complex mixtures. Due to the rudimentary methods of disposal and the number of years of e-waste processing, rural areas in China are beginning to experience contaminated surface water and soil that can hinder communities from further living on the land. In the case of Guiyu China, the region with the world's highest levels of cancer-causing dioxins, discharge water runs off into Lianjiang River."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"The Lianjiang River is considered to be a category 5 river; meaning that according to the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection, the water quality is not safe for human consumption or agricultural function and use. Some open air workshops in China use acid to recover valuable materials from e-waste and wastewater is transported to drainage pits, which can run off into other water bodies and severely impact freshwater ecosystems and impact agricultural sources. In some cases, groundwater is contaminated from the acids of shredding and separating workshops."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"In Guiyu, 80% of the children suffer from respiratory diseases because children typically work in or live near waste disposal sites. Children in China also can experience elevated blood levels, skin damage, headaches, chronic gastritis, and duodenal ulcers due to e-waste recycling pollutants. In Guiyu China, e-waste workers adhere to the industry despite risks, as can make an equivalent of $600 a month, which pays more than other occupations.Africa: Certain African countries where U.S. e-waste is shipped to, are known for the use of child labour at e-waste dismantling sites."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"In Ghana at the Agbogbloshie e-waste site, the employment of children of ages 5–18 has been documented. Young girls between the ages of 9-12 have been reported to primarily work as collectors and vendors, while the other children directly assist in burning and dismantling processes. The UN's ""Solving the E-Waste Problem"" initiative, which was set up in 2007 to tackle the world's growing crisis of electronic waste, warned that the global volume of electronic waste refuse is set to grow by 33% over the next four years."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"Much of it will be dumped in sites such as those in Agbogbloshie, increasing the risk of land contamination with lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic and flame retardants. Currently several organizations are working towards creating better conditions to handle e-waste. These organizations include Global Alliance for Health and Pollution GAHP; Green Advocacy Ghana, an environmental NGO based in Ghana, West Africa that aims at upholding and enhancing the sustainability and integrity of Ghana's environment, and Pure Earth.Latin America: Similar to Africa, Latin American countries associated with U.S. e-waste export contain child labor at management sites."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"In Nicaragua in particular, studies have documented that children working at the sites have highly elevated levels of PBDE in the children's serum. The reports document, however, that low-income communities that surround (but not work at) the site, have similar raised levels of PBDE and heavy metal dioxins. Malnourishment is common in children in these surrounding areas, and increases children's susceptibility of developing fatal diseases from exposure to these chemicals. E-waste management is slowly been taken into the political agenda of some countries in Latin America."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"However, in most countries the present destinies of obsolete electrical and electronic equipment as well as quantitative figures are unknown. Only Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, Argentina and Chile have particular baseline studies available so far. Specific e-waste legislation is in development in Costa Rica. All other countries of Latin America still lag behind in drafting a legal framework for e-waste management. While drafting such legislation the roles of both government and industry need to be clarified."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"Traditional models for solid waste management have assigned the tasks of collection and disposal of waste to public authorities; however, an EPR model requires an adequate assignation and re partition of responsibilities along the reverse supply chain. A participatory process in designing the legal framework is therefore a prerequisite of a successful later implementation.India: In India, over 1 million urban poor workers, often with low literacy skills and awareness of the potential hazards of e-waste exposure, manually dismantle e-waste. A great portion of Indian e-waste workers are children and women."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"High levels of dioxin compounds, which are linked to cancer and developmental defects, have been commonly found in the breast milk and placentas of women exposed to e-waste, which can reveal improper disposal and handling of electronic products. Specifically, there are various reports that the city of Delhi contains several e-waste management sites that use concentrated hydrochloric and nitric acids to extract gold and copper. Recycling of e-waste is a very lucrative business in India and dominated by informal actors. E-waste in India is often processed to recover valuable materials in small workshops using rudimentary recycling methods."
 Environmental and health effects , Global effects ,"For instance, during the manual dismantling process in informal dismantling and recycling sites, e-waste recyclers use chisels, hammers, and cutting torches to open solder connections and separate various types of metals and components. Researchers have collected ashes from two waste burning operations in New Delhi, India, at Ibrahimpur and Shashtri Park which contained high levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc.Thailand: In Thailand, e-waste can also lead to human health risks, such as cancer and human developmental difficulties, if it is not properly disposed of. Also, the incinerators they use to burn e-waste can cause headaches, coughing, and nausea."
 United States legislation , Federal ,"The United States Congress considers a number of electronic waste bills, including the National Computer Recycling Act introduced by Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA). Meanwhile, the main federal law governing solid waste is the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976. It covers only CRTs, though state regulations may differ. There are also separate laws concerning battery disposal. Several trade organizations including the Consumer Electronics Association are lobbying for the implementation of comprehensive federal laws."
 United States legislation , Federal ,"On March 25, 2009, the House Science and Technology Committee approved funding for research on reducing electronic waste and mitigating environmental impact, regarded by sponsor Ralph Hall (R-TX) as the first federal bill to address electronic waste directly. On July 6, 2009, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) proposed the ""Electronic Device Recycling Research and Development Act""."
 United States legislation , Federal ,"Bill S.1397 not only focuses on stopping illegal e-waste dumping, but it also calls for sustainable design of electronic equipment as well as offers funding for research and development of more sustainable designs, which would reduce the amount of toxic waste and increase the reuse and recycling of electronic products.During Earth Day, April 22, 2009, two bills were passed by the House of Representatives: H.R. 1580 Electronic Device Recycling Research and Development Act, introduced by Rep. Bart Gordon on March 18, 2009, and H.R. 957 Green Energy Education Act, introduced by Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX.) H.R."
 United States legislation , Federal ,"1580 requires the Administration of EPA to give merit-based grants to consortia of universities, government labs and private industries to conduct research with the purpose of finding new approaches to recycling and reduction of hazardous materials in electronic devices and to ""contribute to the professional development of scientists, engineers, and technicians in the field of electronic device manufacturing, design, refurnishing, and recycling."" The bill will require the recipients of the grants to report every two years to Congress about the progress of their research, gaps in the advancement, risks and regulatory barriers that might hinder their progress."
 United States legislation , Federal ,"The Congressional Budget Office estimates that to put the bill in effect ""would cost $10 million in 2010 and $80 million over the 2010-2014 period."" The other billed passed, H.R. 957, authorizes the Department of Energy in partnership with the National Science Foundation to provide grants to Institutions of higher education to promote education and training for Engineers and Architects ""in high energy and high-performance building design."""
 United States legislation , State ,"A policy of ""diversion from landfill"" has driven legislation in many states requiring higher and higher volumes of electronic waste to be collected and processed separate from the solid waste stream. In 2001, Arkansas enacted the Arkansas Computer and Electronic Solid Waste Management Act, which requires that state agencies manage and sell surplus computer equipment, establishes a computer and electronics recycling fund, and authorizes the Department of Environmental Quality to regulate and/or ban the disposal of computer and electronic equipment in Arkansas landfills.California was the first state to legislate around the issue of e-waste."
 United States legislation , State ,"It implemented a broader waste ban, with advance recovery fee funding in 2003. Electronic waste in California may neither be disposed of in a landfill nor be exported overseas. The 2003 Electronic Waste Recycling Act in California introduced an Electronic Waste Recycling Fee on all new monitors and televisions sold to cover the cost of recycling. The fee ranges from six to ten dollars. California went from only a handful of recyclers to over 60 within the state and over 600 collection sites."
 United States legislation , State ,"The amount of the fee depends on the size of the monitor; it was adjusted on July 1, 2005, in order to match the real cost of recycling. Cellphones are ""considered hazardous waste"" in California; many chemicals in cellphones leach from landfills into the groundwater system."
 United States legislation , State ,"In 2016, California approved AB 1419, a bill that aims to recycle panel glass, which is used in different types of electronics, locally instead of shipping it to other countries for disposal.Colorado legislation requires education programs that address its electronic waste problem.In 2004, Maine passed Maine Public Law 661, An Act to Protect Public Health and the Environment by Providing for a System of Shared Responsibility for the Safe Collection and Recycling of Electronic Waste."
 United States legislation , State ,"It necessitates that after 2006, computer manufacturers take responsibility for handling and recycling computer monitors, and pay the handling costs as well.Massachusetts was the first of the United States to make it illegal to dispose of CRTs in landfills in April 2000, most similar to the European disposal bans of the 1990s. Minnesota enacted a law making vendors responsible for the disposal of their branded electronics."
 United States legislation , State ,"Minnesota legislation also outlaws the dumping of cathode ray tubes in landfills.A law in the state of Washington took effect on January 1, 2009, requiring manufacturers of electronic goods to pay for recycling, and establishing a statewide network of collection points. The program, called E-Cycle Washington, is managed by the Department of Ecology and the Washington Materials Management & Financing Authority.On January 28, 2010, Arizona introduced HB 2614, a producer responsibility law modeled on the Oregon law that would have covered computers, laptops and TV monitors for recycling."
 United States legislation , State ,"However, it was withdrawn on February 15, 2010.As of 2008, 17 states have producer responsibility laws in some form. In all, 35 states have or are considering electronic waste recycling laws. The United States, along with a number of economically developed countries, ships the majority of its e-waste across seas to economically developing countries. The United Nations estimates between 10% and 50% of US e-waste is exported, the EPA estimates 25%, and the International Trade Commission estimates that the number is closer to 13%."
 United States legislation , State ,"Despite the numerous reports existing that document the waste's movement and existence, there lacks a coherent presentation of the data; largely due to the difficulty of accessing this information. Studies indicate that this gap exists primarily because of: undifferentiated trade codes, inconsistent methods of marking and classifying electronic products, inconsistent records kept in waste destination countries, and a lack of pressure holding companies accountable. Shipment of e-waste is not a partisan issue since local governments and private industries collaborate to manage non-functioning electronics."
 United States legislation , State ,"Research indicates that while mobile cell phones make up the overall greatest used electronics flows, TVs account for the largest flow of used electronics that are collected, and monitors have the highest export rates. The data records available show that the largest hubs for mobile phone deportation are Asia (Hong Kong, HKSAR) and the Caribbean and parts of Latin America (Guatemala, Paraguay, Panama, Peru, and Colombia). Larger electronics, such as TVs and monitors, have a higher likelihood of being exported to countries such as Mexico, Paraguay, Venezuela, and China."
 United States legislation , State ,"In addition to directly shipping waste overseas, many developed countries ship their e-waste to ""transport sites"", which then re-export the waste to surrounding countries or rural areas within their own country and make an extra profit. The largest international transit ports reside in Asia (Hong Kong, China, United Arab Emirates), which results in large quantities of waste ending up in smaller regions in the area. A prime example of this is the Chinese town of Guiyu, which has been denoted as the e-waste capital of the world."
 United States' export of e-waste , Export results ,"TVs: Color TVs comprise the group with highest export rates. Higher transportation rates by vessel or over land rather than by air.Mobile Phones: Largest export destinations: Latin America, Asia, South America. 73% of exports occur by air.Computers: Split into two categories: Desktop and Laptop. Laptops have much higher export rates due to lower weight and higher re-use value. Largest export destinations include Asia and Europe.Monitors: Split into two categories: CRT Monitors and Flat Panel Monitors."
 United States' export of e-waste , Re-export destination flows: Transport Sites ,"Completely accurate data concerning E-waste export flows is difficult to acquire and accumulate. There is a difference between simply used electronics that are exported and re-used in different countries and used electronics that are broken down as waste, but the United States lacks reports distinguishing the two. Used electronic often are shipped to a hub, where they are exported to lower-income areas that break down the devices, thus exposing the community to toxins."
 United States' export of e-waste , Re-export destination flows: Transport Sites ,"According to the records that track the initial export of used electronics, the major re-export destination hubs are: Lebanon, Argentina, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, Chile, Mexico, and China."
 United States' export of e-waste , International unregulated e-waste junkyards ,"E-waste is primarily shipped to large international hubs, such as Hong Kong. However, the majority of waste that is not recycled in those hubs is exported to rural areas where the waste is often improperly managed and becomes a severe contaminant. Unregulated junkyards and processing sites are unlicensed and almost always in violation of the law. This results in a lack of worker protection and rights, generally indicating a lack of awareness of the risks and hazards. Aside from general improper dismantling of the devices, open burnings and waste storage commonly take place."
 United States' export of e-waste , Improper dismantling and processing ,"Unregulated e-waste processing junkyards do not contain proper equipment or employ safety precautions. The primary dismantling process generally includes manual separation of the plastic sections from the rest of the device; the plastic sections are then shredded into small portions if not re-usable themselves. If these plastic fragments are not directly resold to larger companies, they are further broken down into a fine powder. When this process is poorly regulated, the powder is easily inhaled and absorbed into the soil, air, and surrounding vegetation."
 United States' export of e-waste , Improper dismantling and processing ,"The electronic devices are also stripped of their heavy metal components; this process in turn exposes workers to the raw elements of the metals. In addition to manually dismantling the devices, unregulated junkyards are ultimate disposal sites. Device disposal is mainly done by burning or smashing and burying the fragments; the aftermath of which has been documented to cause significant health problems in the surrounding area."
 United States' export of e-waste , Open burning ,"Open burnings are the most common means of 'disposing of' e-waste and occur primarily in rural areas with low incomes of developing countries. Communities use open burning for a variety of functions: For direct disposal, it takes the least amount of man-power and is the cheapest option. For precious metal extraction, it can be an effective method to extract certain valuable metals, such as gold. The combustion of burning e-waste results in ash that contains fine particulate matter; a measure of pollutants that has been linked to cardiovascular and pulmonary issues."
 United States' export of e-waste , Open burning ,"Additional health risks result from direct exposure to the toxic metals that release dioxins when burned and in addition to being inhaled, become embedded into the soil and plants in the surrounding area. The United Nations has done significant research into the growing issue of e-waste disposal and has documented that different communities are disproportionately affected by this issue: ""Such practices are closely related to poverty because uncontrolled waste dumps typically are located close to human settlements."
 United States' export of e-waste , Open burning ,"Since poor people neither have the economic means nor the technical knowledge, they also ignite their own wastes and thus create their own dioxin sources in their backyards. Therefore, women and children spending most time at home and living close to the burning areas are most exposed and at higher risk than others, e.g., urban and wealthier populations."""
 United States' export of e-waste , Waste storage for processing ,"In addition to open burning of electronic waste, rural communities are often used as storage locations. There exist varying stages in the life of an electronic device, and devices are stored or recycled depending on their specific stage. Storage facilities are almost always improperly constructed and regulated and thus generally result in the contamination of the soil and natural area surrounding the facility. Facilities that store cathode ray tubes (CRT) are particularly contaminated. Soil and dust samples collected at these locations indicate high levels of cadmium, zinc, and yttrium along with other heavy metal dioxins."
 United States' export of e-waste , Export responsibility ,"While the number of e-Waste recycling programs in the United States has increased, a portion of the waste continues to be shipped overseas. Recent research done by the Basel Action Network indicates that along with companies directly attempting to ship their waste overseas or into domestic landfills, certain questionable recycling programs themselves have contributed to the export numbers."
 United States' export of e-waste , Export responsibility ,"Questionable recycling companies act as brokers and ""cut costs by offloading dismantling and recycling to impoverished countries with lax labor laws, weak environmental regulations, and poor human rights track records."" Basel Action Network gained credibility after exposing electronic take-back programs that promoted their focus on sustainability by attaching tracking devices to the donated used electronic devices. About one third of the 200 geolocating tracking devices of BAN's primary investigation ended up overseas and finished their journey in rural Hong Kong.Before any legislation regulating e-waste was enacted, companies could directly export their e-waste to recycling or landfill hubs."
 United States' export of e-waste , Export responsibility ,"After regulation measures were introduced, the majority of exports are done through either certified e-waste handlers or uncertified handlers. The largest two competing certified handlers are e-stewards and Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI). ISRI represents some of the largest waste handlers because they are in trade with Asia and Africa. Although many recycling programs have increased in efficiency, loopholes still exist within the recycling program that allow companies to continue to export parts of the used electronic devices."
 United States' export of e-waste , Export responsibility ,"The majority of e-stewards recyclers implement no-export policies regarding the entire device, yet are still allowed to export raw plastics and metals in their simplest form. Due to this loophole, electronics are often labeled as raw plastics in order to pass customs, but in reality contain most of the components of the full electronic device; this nearly complete device then follows the general export process of being shipped and broken down at an e-waste hub, where the non-valuable components are then shipped to a junkyard to be broken down."
 United States' export of e-waste , Export responsibility ,"Additionally, reports show that recyclers with e-steward certification are able to export used electronics if the devices have undergone a test that proves they can still function. These devices similarly make up the shipments made to hubs for the extraction of valuable parts."
 Regulation of e-waste , International regulation ,"The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal of 1989 is an international treaty that stipulates guidelines of hazardous waste movement. In 2006, members of the Basel Convention began to discuss the addition of electronic waste management. Though 185 states including the European Union have ratified the treaty, the United States, one of the largest exporters of electronic waste, has not ratified it."
 Regulation of e-waste , International regulation ,"In terms of international regulatory bodies, in 2010 the United States EPA and United Nations University Solving the E-waste Problem Initiative (UNU-Step) began responding to the issue of electronic waste being exported to developing countries by tracking global flows of electronic waste."
 Regulation of e-waste , International regulation ,"In addition, in 2011 the United States EPA, Taiwanese EPA, and other international governments collaborated to form the International E-Waste Management Network (IEMN) to outline best practices on global electronic waste management and highlight next steps.In 2018, China issued the ""National Sword"" policy to regulate the number of recyclables that enter the country and prevent other countries from sending various solid waste materials, such as metals and plastics, into China. This has led countries to begin exporting their waste to other Asian countries, such as Vietnam and Thailand. Subsequently, these countries began to implement bans on waste as well."
 Regulation of e-waste , International regulation ,"In Vietnam, they have decided to stop allowing countries to send waste and cut a significant amount of their importations, as of 2018. In terms of electronic waste specifically, Thailand ruled in this same year that they would stop taking electronic waste from other countries and in 2021, they would stop accepting plastics.In 2021, China decided that they will not allow any type of solid waste into their country because of the overabundance of waste they've been receiving since the 1980s."
 Regulation of e-waste , Domestic regulation ,"To address consumer and manufacturer desires to properly handle e-waste in the absence of federal legislation, two US recycling standards were put in place: the e-stewards Standard for Responsible Recycling and Reuse of Electronic Equipment and the Responsible Recycling Practices (R2). Certified e-waste recyclers must comply with outlined best practices for handling e-waste. R2 was released in 2008 and revised in 2013 and is thought of as more practical to implement while also being fully consistent with the Basel Convention because it was organized by the EPA and other e-waste stakeholders. E-stewards and R2 recyclers are regulated by different protocols."
 Regulation of e-waste , Domestic regulation ,"In the area of exporting e-waste to developing countries for repairs or recycling, R2 recyclers can still export while e-stewards recyclers are prohibited. In the area of incinerating or land-filling e-waste, R2 recyclers are able to put toxic e-waste in landfills or incinerators if undefined 'circumstances beyond their control' take place while e-stewards are prohibited. In regards to workplace safety, R2 recyclers are permitted to determine which chemicals are toxic and the appropriate levels of exposure while e-stewards must test practices for their hazards, like breaking CRTs, removing mercury-containing devices, shredding and using solvents or thermal processes to break down e-waste."
 Regulation of e-waste , Domestic regulation ,"Another consumer and public health issue is prison e-waste recycling. In this area, R2 recyclers may use prison recycling operations at their discretion while e-steward recyclers are banned from doing so. Currently, there are more than 600 certified R2 recyclers in about 21 countries. The Basel Action Network (BAN) was a participant in the EPA's R2 recycling certification but broke away within two-and-a-half years. Because of the less stringent regulations on R2 recyclers, the Basel Action Network formed the e-stewards recycling certification to generate more robust e-waste regulations."
 Regulation of e-waste , Domestic regulation ,"Though most companies choose R2 or e-stewards certification, some companies like Sims Recycling Solutions are certified by both."
 Regulation of e-waste , Lobbying ,"Various organizations actively lobby government in order to address electronic waste issues. The major organizations are the Basel Action Network and the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. In 2002, a small activist group in California called Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) began lobbying, consisting largely of employees from PC and printer producers, like Hewlett-Packard. The coalition lobbied state legislators for stricter e-waste regulation which played a large role in the passing of the California Electronic Waste Recycling Act. In 2010, Empire Government Strategies helped write New York's E-Waste law that requires New York electronic companies to lead free e-waste recycling initiatives."
 Regulation of e-waste , Lobbying ,"Electronic Recyclers International, a small business that recycles electronic waste, began lobbying for more effective policies to combat e-waste in 2012.Since e-waste regulations began passing state by state, electronics manufacturers have both lobbied against e-waste regulations and been very cooperative with regulations once passed. In Washington, large companies fought against the passing of the 2006 Electronic Product Recycling Act. Yet since its passing, companies like Apple and Microsoft have instituted large scale takeback recycling initiatives, while also helping to fund the recycling and disposal of electronics."
 Regulation of e-waste , Lobbying ,"According to the EPA, consumers should dispose of electronics via recycling because,""Electronic products are made from valuable resources and materials, including metals, plastics, and glass, all of which require energy to mine and manufacture."
 Regulation of e-waste , Lobbying ,"Donating or recycling consumer electronics conserves our natural resources and avoids air and water pollution, as well as greenhouse gas emissions that are caused by manufacturing virgin materials."" Consumer recycling options include donating equipment directly to organizations in need, sending devices directly back to their original manufacturers, or getting components to a convenient recycler or refurbisher.However, recycling is not practical in all cases, and disposal is sometimes necessary."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Donation ,"The EPA maintains a list of electronic recycling and donation options for American consumers. The National Cristina Foundation, TechSoup (the Donate Hardware List), the Computer Takeback Campaign, and the National Technology Recycling Project provide resources for recycling. Local recycling sites that do not process waste products on site still contribute to electronic waste. A key issue with the donation of electronic waste by consumers is convenience."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Donation ,"Although there are state-by-state options, like ones listed above, a 2004 mail survey of California households found that a lack of nearby recycling options for e-waste was the number one reason for residents not recycling their e-waste. Pew Research Center survey information also found that in 2016, only approximately 48% of adult Americans said electronic waste was recycled in their community, in a sample size of 1,534 people over all 50 states."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Takeback ,"Corporations across the United States offer electronic takeback and recycling programs, offering low-cost to no-cost recycling. These centers accept and recycle electronics from the public, including mobile phones, laptop and desktop computers, digital cameras, and home and auto electronics. Companies such as Staples, Toshiba, and Gateway offer takeback programs that provide monetary incentives for recyclable or working technologies. The Manufacturers Recycling Management Co. was founded by Panasonic, Sharp Corporation, and Toshiba to manage electronic waste branded by these manufacturers, including 750 tons of TVs, computers, audio equipment, faxes, and components in its first four months."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Takeback ,"Office Depot lets customers obtain ""tech recycling"" boxes for e-waste if not eligible for the EcoNEW tech trade-in program. Best Buy offers a similar program for products purchased from Best Buy.Though helpful to both the environment and its citizens, there are some downsides to such programs. Many corporations offer services for a variety of electronic items, while their recycling centers are few in number. Recycling centers and takeback programs are available in many parts of the country, but the type and amount of equipment to be recycled tends to be limited."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Takeback ,"Some corporations, like Sony in its Take Back Recycling Program, provide recycling incentives but only accept up to five recycled items per day and only if they are that corporation's products. Sony also partners with the Waste Management Inc. Recycle America program and offers discounts and tradeup programs. Costco, which offers free shipping and handling for all recycled pieces of equipment, will only allow Costco club members to participate in their programs. Crutchfield Electronics offers its own gift cards in exchange for electronic waste, through Consumer Electronics Exchange."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Takeback ,"Hewlett-Packard has recycled over 750 million pounds of electronic waste globally, including hardware and print cartridges."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Reuse ,"There are several organizations that implement reuse programs, such as Digitunity and the World Computer Exchange. Digitunity is a non-profit organization that aims to collect used devices to donate it to those in need. The World Computer Exchange accepts computer donations of electronics that they give to low-income communities worldwide.Free Geek is a collectively run, non-profit organization based in Portland, Oregon. It aims to reuse or recycle used computer equipment that might otherwise become hazardous waste, and to make computer technology more accessible to those who lack financial means or technical knowledge. Also, New Neighborhood Development, Inc."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , Reuse ,"is a recently started non-profit organization in Illinois, providing free electronic recycling to bring awareness to e-waste hazards. TechForward, SellCell.com, Flipsy, Gazelle, NextWorth, and Trademore are examples of companies that had accepted or will accept trade-ins of used devices as well as resale to consumers."
 Consumer recycling and disposal , A form of household hazardous waste ,"When feasible, e-waste should be recycled. But recycling such items is not always practical. When this happens, a household consumer should consider whether the e-waste is household hazardous waste, and if so (which it often is), take it to a proper place for disposal.

 History , Founding ,"Founded in 1903 as ""the Development and Funding Company"" by Elon Huntington Hooker, of Rochester, NY, the company used the Townsend cell to electrolyse salt into chlorine and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), also known as ""caustic soda"" and ""lye,"" in a chloralkali process."
 History , Founding ,"Elmer Sperry, founder of Sperry Electric, and Leo Baekeland, inventor of Bakelite and Velox photographic paper, consulted Hooker to improve the design of the cell.The company was sited in Niagara Falls, NY foremost because of the low-cost electricity from the Niagara Falls power project, but also because of the abundance of salt from nearby mines, and availability of water from the Niagara River."
 History , First product lines ,"Chlorine, used for sanitation and the chlorination of drinking water, was sold as chlorinated lime and chlorobenzene, which was an ingredient for an explosive used in World War I. Later, solvents like trichloroethylene and phenol were sold for use by the subsidiary degreasing and dry cleaning company Detrex. Hooker licensed his diaphragm cell technology to other chloralkali producers.In 1918, Hooker formed a company to hydrogenate vegetable oils, while Hooker Chemical also began producing sulfur chloride and sodium chlorate.In 1922, Hooker bought the S. Wander & Sons Company for the retail sales of lye and chlorinated lime."
 History , First product lines ,"Samuel Wander had a retail store at 105 Hudson St, New York, NY, and factories in Albany, NY. Hooker sold the business in 1927. Hooker built a new chloralkali plant in Tacoma, WA in 1929. Additional products, including sodium sulfide, sodium sulfhydrate, sodium tetrasulfide, and aluminum chloride were produced by the company."
 History , World War II ,"In World War II, Hooker was a leading supplier of dodecyl mercaptan for the synthesis of rubber. The company also produced arsenic trichloride, thionyl chloride, and hexachlorobenzene. Hooker expanded into plastics manufacturing, developing epoxy vinyl ester resins, and in 1955 acquired a thermoset plastic phenolic resins business, called Durez Corp."
 History , Sale to Occidental Petroleum ,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation purchased Hooker Chemical Company in 1968. Since then, owners have renamed the company several times."
 History , Documentaries ,"In 2002, filmmaker David J. Ruck told the story of the Hooker Chemical Company and its environmental negligence in Montague, Michigan, in the documentary film, This is Not a Chocolate FactoryThe films, The Killing Ground and A Fierce Green Fire, also explore the history of several of Hooker Chemical's dumping sites and the Love Canal tragedy.

 Incidents ,,"On 12 March 2012, Caribbean Princess suffered a problem with her port side propulsion engine that required her to return to her home port of San Juan, Puerto Rico after a stopover in St. Maarten. The problem caused Princess Cruises to cancel the next two trips (scheduled for 18 and 25 March).Caribbean Princess experienced a norovirus outbreak in January 2014 sickening approximately 200 people on board. The scheduled cruise ended two days early.On 3 August 2016, Caribbean Princess experienced a power outage while on a British Isles cruise."
 Incidents ,,"The ship completely lost propulsion about 25 nautical miles (46 km) southeast of Dublin, Ireland in the Irish Sea, and was left adrift for nine hours. During the power outage, air conditioners, lighting, hotel functions, and toilets were all functional. The ship regained power and sailed to Belfast, Northern Ireland, missing her next port of Dublin on her itinerary. An ocean-going tug was dispatched from Holyhead in North Wales, UK and an air/sea rescue helicopter from Dublin monitored the situation. The cruise continued without any further problems to either the ship or the passengers."
 Incidents ,,"In 2019, a man in his 30's drowned in a pool aboard Caribbean Princess. On 26 August 2013, the crew of Caribbean Princess deliberately discharged 4,227 US gallons (16,000 L) of oil-contaminated bilge pollution off the southern coast of England. The discharge involved the illegal modification of the vessel's on-board pollution control systems and use of a ""magic pipe"", and was photographed by a newly hired engineer. When the ship subsequently berthed at Southampton, the engineer resigned his position and reported the discharge to the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency."
 Incidents ,,"An investigation was launched by the United States Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division which found that the practice had been taking place on Caribbean Princess and four other Princess ships since 2005. In December 2016, Princess Cruise Lines agreed to plead guilty to seven felony charges and pay a $40 million penalty. The charges related to illegal discharges off the coasts of Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico."
 Incidents ,,"As part of the agreement cruise ships from eight Carnival companies, including Carnival Cruise Line and Holland America Line, are required to operate for five years under a court-supervised environmental compliance plan with independent audits and a court-appointed monitor. According to the US Justice Department, the fine was the ""largest-ever criminal penalty involving deliberate vessel pollution."" Caribbean Princess has undertaken cruises from European ports around the British Isles, northern Europe and the Mediterranean and from North American ports to the Caribbean, New England and Canada."
 Incidents ,,"The ship in July 2019 left her current home port of Fort Lauderdale, Florida and sailed up to a new home port in New York for cruises to Canada, New England, and Greenland. As of 2020, however, the ship sails primarily in the Caribbean."

 The problem of pollution control ,,"Smoke pollution had been a problem in St. Louis for many decades prior to the event, due to the large-scale burning of bituminous (soft) coal to provide heat and power for homes, businesses and transport. In 1893, the Council passed an ordinance prohibiting the emission of ""thick grey smoke within the corporate limits of St. Louis"" but was unable to enforce it because of failed legal action taken against Heitzberg Packing and Provision Company, one of the worst corporate offenders. The effectiveness of laws was also limited by the lack of adequate inspection and enforcement. In 1933, the mayor, Bernard F."
 The problem of pollution control ,,"Dickmann, created a ""citizen smoke committee"" and appointed his personal secretary Raymond Tucker to take charge of efforts to improve air quality. Early efforts had relied on education such as teaching people how to build cleaner fires – but this had almost no impact. It was soon realized that real improvement would only come about by switching to a cleaner fuel – gas, oil, coke, or anthracite were all considered but ruled out on cost grounds."
 The problem of pollution control ,,"The alternative was to wash and size the existing soft coal to make it burn hotter and cleaner, and ensure that all coal sold in St. Louis was of this variety. In February 1937 a smoke ordinance was passed creating a ""Division of Smoke Regulation in the Department of Public Safety"", forcing larger businesses to burn only clean coal and setting standards for smoke emission and inspection."
 The problem of pollution control ,,"By 1938 emissions from commercial smokestacks had been reduced by two-thirds.Despite some improvement, smoke pollution was still a visible problem since the new law did not cover smaller businesses and domestic users – 97% of homes still used coal. The city council was reluctant to pass further legislation that might alienate voters so the mayor's ""enforcer"", Tucker, was limited to using persuasion through the press and radio broadcasts. One newspaper in particular, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, became notable for its campaign to persuade residents of the benefits of switching to cleaner forms of coal."
 The problem of pollution control ,,"However, on Tuesday, November 28, 1939, a meteorological temperature inversion trapped emissions from coal burning close to the ground, resulting in ""the day the sun didn't shine"". A cloud of thick black smoke enveloped St. Louis, far worse than any previously seen in the city. The day came to be known as ""Black Tuesday"". The smog hung about for nine days over the course of the following month. This proved to be the catalyst that forced the council's hand. New cleaner, affordable supplies of coal (semi-anthracite) were quickly secured from Arkansas in time for the next winter."

 Notable incidents in the United States ," Fallston, Maryland ","Harford County, Maryland, found MTBE in wells near several of its filling stations beginning in 2004. This led the state of Maryland to make moves to ban MTBE.In 2005, an Exxon-Mobil station in Fallston, Maryland, was found to be leaking MTBE into the local wells. The discovery resulted in the station being abruptly closed. Exxon-Mobil referred to the closure as a ""business decision"". Following the closure, MTBE levels in the area dropped.In September 2004, Harford County placed a six-month moratorium on construction of filling stations."
 Notable incidents in the United States ," Jacksonville, Maryland ","In 2006, the wells of a neighborhood in Jacksonville, Maryland, were contaminated by a spill of 26,000 gallons of gasoline from an Exxon-Mobil station in the area, resulting in an ongoing court battle. The suit has been filed by the state of Maryland's Department of the Environment on behalf of the area's residents, seeking millions of dollars in damages from Exxon-Mobil. Many residents also filed their own separate lawsuits.The case began in 2006, when a gasoline tank sprang a leak that was not detected for 34 days. Testing of 120 wells resulted in dangerously high levels of MTBE being found."
 Notable incidents in the United States ," Jacksonville, Maryland ","Residents were put in danger by the spill, and in order to prevent further health problems, they required bottled water for cooking, drinking, and brushing teeth. Residents of Jacksonville continue to use bottled water for all activities despite having MTBE filters and alarms installed in their homes."
 Notable incidents in the United States ," Jacksonville, Maryland ","Home values also dropped as a result of the spill.In September 2008, Exxon-Mobil settled the case with the state by agreeing to pay a $4 million fine, and face an additional $1 million in penalties annually if they did not work to clean up the spill.In March 2009, a jury awarded $150 million in damages to some of the area's residents. The jury did not assess any punitive damages in the case, finding that Exxon Mobil did not act fraudulently. A separate case including over 150 property owners as plaintiffs began in early 2011."
 Notable incidents in the United States ," Jacksonville, Maryland ","Punitive damages were awarded to the second group of plaintiffs, on the basis that Exxon acted fraudulently, however this decision was later reversed."
 Notable incidents in the United States ," Santa Monica, California ","In 1995 high levels of MTBE were unexpectedly discovered in the water wells of Santa Monica, California, and the U.S. Geological Survey reported detections. Subsequent U.S. findings indicate tens of thousands of contaminated sites in water wells distributed across the country. As per toxicity alone, MTBE is not classified as a hazard for the environment, but it imparts an unpleasant taste to water even at very low concentrations. The maximum contaminant level of MTBE in drinking water has not yet been established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)."
 Notable incidents in the United States ," Santa Monica, California ","The leakage problem is partially attributed to the lack of effective regulations for underground storage tanks, but spillage from overfilling is also a contributor. As an ingredient in unleaded gasoline, MTBE is the most water-soluble component. When dissolved in groundwater, MTBE will lead the contaminant plume with the remaining components such as benzene and toluene following. Thus the discovery of MTBE in public groundwater wells indicates that the contaminant source was a gasoline release. Its criticism and subsequent decreased usage, some claim, is more a product of its easy detectability (taste) in extremely low concentrations (ppb) than its toxicity."
 Notable incidents in the United States ," Santa Monica, California ","The MTBE concentrations used in the EU (usually 1.0–1.6%) and allowed (maximum 5%) in Europe are lower than in California.Chevron, BP, and other oil companies agreed to settle with Santa Monica for $423 million on May 7, 2008."
 Regulation in the United States , Restrictions on MTBE manufacturing and usage ,"In 2000, EPA drafted plans to phase out the use of MTBE nationwide over four years.. Some states enacted MTBE prohibitions without waiting for federal restrictions. California banned MTBE as a gasoline additive in 2002. The State of New York banned the use of MTBE as a ""fuel additive"", effective in 2004. MTBE use is still legal in the state for other industrial uses.The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 removed the oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline and established a renewable fuel standard."
 Regulation in the United States , Restrictions on MTBE manufacturing and usage ,The lack of MTBE liability protection in the law also prompted refiners to substitute ethanol for MTBE as a gasoline additive.
 Regulation in the United States , Drinking water regulations ,"EPA issued a drinking water health advisory for MTBE, a guidance document for water utilities and the public, in 1997. The Agency first listed MTBE in 1998 as a candidate for development of a national Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) standard in drinking water. As of 2020 EPA has not announced whether it will develop an MCL. EPA uses toxicity data in developing MCLs for public water systems.California established a state-level MCL for MTBE in 2000.

 United States ,,"In the United States, 17 states have laws regarding electronics recycling. The non-profit National Center for Electronics Recycling calls it ""patchwork of state regulations""."
 United States , California ,"The Electronic Waste Recycling Fee is a fee imposed by the government of the state of California in the United States on new purchases of electronic products with viewable screens. It is one of the key elements of the California Electronic Waste Recycling Act. Retailers submit the collected fees to the Board of Equalization. Retailers may pay the fee on behalf of the consumer, however the retailer must remit the same amount to the State and indicate the amount on the consumer receipt. Retailers may retain 3% of the collected fees in order to recoup costs of collection."

 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) has listed various portions of the Hudson as having impaired water quality due to PCBs, cadmium, and other toxic compounds. Hudson River tributaries with impaired water quality (not necessarily the same pollutants as the Hudson main stem) are Mohawk River, Dwaas Kill, Schuyler Creek, Saw Mill River, Esopus Creek, Hoosic River, Quaker Creek, and Batten Kill. Many lakes in the Hudson drainage basin are also listed."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"Other ongoing pollution problems affecting the river include: accidental sewage discharges, urban runoff, heavy metals, furans, dioxin, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).Numerous factories that once lined the Hudson River poured garbage and industrial waste directly into the river. These factories produced transformers, capacitors, and electric motors, which used PCBs as dielectric and coolant fluid. This pollution was not comprehensively assessed until the 1970s. By that time, the largest remaining factories in the area were owned by General Electric, which became primarily responsible for cleaning the Hudson River."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"Between approximately 1947 and 1977, GE released 1,300,000 pounds (590,000 kg) of PCBs into the river. The PCBs came from the company's two capacitor manufacturing plants at Hudson Falls and Fort Edward, New York. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the manufacture of PCBs in 1979. The bulk of the PCBs in the river were manufactured by Monsanto Co. under the brand names Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"The highest concentration of PCBs is found in the Thompson Island Pool.Another noted polluter was General Motors, which operated the North Tarrytown Assembly in North Tarrytown, New York (now known as Sleepy Hollow). The 90-acre (36 ha) plant was in operation from 1896 to 1996. The plant used about 1 million gallons of water per day, which was returned to the river as waste. The plant's industrial waste (primarily lead chromate and other painting, cleaning, and soldering chemicals) would be emptied directly into the river. Domestic waste would be processed through the village's sewage treatment plant."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"Around 1971, the village's Sewer and Water Superintendent assured that the pollution reports were exaggerated, and that he and other residents would swim by a beach nearby, however Dominick Pirone, an ecologist and former director of the Hudson River Fishermen's Association (now Riverkeeper) was quoted as saying: ""You can tell what color cars they are painting on a given day by what color the river is.""A 2008 study suggested that mercury in common Hudson River fish, including striped bass, yellow perch, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and carp, declined strongly over the preceding three decades."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"The conclusions were extracted from a large database of mercury analyses of fish fillets accumulated by NYSDEC and collected over much of the length of the Hudson, from New York City waters to the Adirondack watershed."

 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"the trends were in line with the recovery that the Hudson River experienced over the preceding few decades, in response to the efforts of activist groups, government officials and industry by cooperating to help clean up the river system.In 1991, zebra mussels, an invasive species, first appeared in the Hudson River, causing the near-disappearance of native pearly mussels.In 2010, the NYSDEC determined that the Indian Point Energy Center, a nuclear power plant in Buchanan, was violating the Clean Water Act because of its large withdrawals of water from the Hudson, which kills millions of fish and other aquatic organisms each year."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"The state requested that Entergy, the plant operator, replace its fish screens with cooling towers to mitigate the environmental impacts. In 2017 the State of New York and Entergy reached agreement that the Indian Point plant would close in 2021. The plant permanently stopped generating energy on April 30, 2021. The PCBs caused extensive contamination of fish in the river and apparently triggered a rapid evolutionary change in the Atlantic tomcod, which after about 50 years of exposure evolved a two amino acid change in its AHR2 receptor gene, causing the receptor to bind more weakly with PCBs than normal."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,The mutation does not prevent the tomcods from accumulating PCBs in their bodies and passing them on to striped bass and whatever else eats them. This system of passing contamination on to larger organisms is also known as biomagnification. The toxic chemicals also accumulated in sediments that settled to the river bottom.In 1976 NYSDEC banned all fishing in the Upper Hudson because of health concerns with PCBs.
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,It also issued advisories restricting the consumption of fish caught within a 20-mile (30 km) long segment of the Hudson River from Hudson Falls to Troy.Fish advisories issued by the New York State Department of Health (DOH) remain in effect as of late 2022. DOH recommends eating no fish caught from the South Glens Falls Dam to the Federal Dam at Troy.
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"Women over 50 and children under 15 are not advised to eat any fish caught south of the Palmer Falls Dam in Corinth, while others are advised to eat anywhere from one to four meals per month of Hudson River fish, depending on species and location caught. The Department of Health cites mercury, PCBs, dioxin, and cadmium as the chemicals impacting fish in these areas.PCBs are thought to be responsible for health concerns that include neurological disorders, lower IQ and poor short-term memory (active memory), hormonal disruption, suppressed immune system, cancer, skin irritations, Parkinson's disease, ADHD, heart disease, and diabetes."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"PCB contamination in humans may come from drinking the contaminated water, absorption through the skin, eating contaminated aquatic life, and/or inhaling volatilized PCBs. PCB contamination is especially dangerous for pregnant and nursing women. The contamination can reach the fetus and potentially cause birth defects. Contamination through breast milk can also have harmful effects on the child indirectly. In 1966, Pete Seeger and Toshi Seeger founded Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, an environmental education organization and an actual boat (a sloop), that promotes awareness of the river and its history."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"Clearwater gained national recognition for its activism starting in the 1970s to force a clean-up of PCB contamination of the Hudson caused by GE and other companies. Other specific Hudson watershed problems with which Clearwater is concerned are development pressures in the southern half of the Hudson Valley, pesticide runoff, the Manhattan west side waterfront, Indian Point nuclear reactors, and New York/New Jersey Harbor dredge spoil disposal. In 1972 Congress passed the Clean Water Act and established a nationwide discharge permit system for all surface waters. All Hudson River point source dischargers were required to obtain permits issued by NYSDEC."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"The restrictions in these permits led to an overall reduction in pollutant loadings to the river, as factories, power plants and municipalities installed or improved their wastewater treatment systems or made other plant modifications to reduce pollution. Among the prominent sewage plant upgrades was the completion of the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant in Manhattan, where 150 million gallons per day of untreated sewage was discharged to the river until the plant opened in 1986."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"However, persistent pollutants such as PCBs and heavy metals, that had been discharged prior to implementation of the new permit requirements, remained in the sediments of the river.In 1980, Consolidated Edison (Con Ed) agreed to drop its 17-year fight to build a pumped-storage hydroelectricity facility on Storm King Mountain, after a legal challenge by the non-profit environmental organization Scenic Hudson."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"The actions of local citizen organizations that led to the Con Ed decision spurred the creation of Riverkeeper, a non-profit environmental organization that grew into a global umbrella organization, the Waterkeeper Alliance.Among the initial attempts to clean up the upper Hudson River was the removal in 1977–78 of 180,000 cubic yards (140,000 m3) of contaminated river sediments near Fort Edward. In 1984, EPA declared a 200-mile (320 km) stretch of the river, from Hudson Falls to New York City, to be a Superfund site requiring cleanup. This hazardous waste site is considered to be one of the largest in the nation."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"Many programs aim to reduce the PCB pollution. In 1991, further PCB pollution was found at Bakers Falls, near the former GE Hudson Falls factory, and a program of remediation was started. In August 1995, a 40-mile (64 km) reach of the upper Hudson was reopened to fishing, but only on a catch-and-release basis. Removal of contaminated soil from Rogers Island was completed in December 1999. In 2001, after a ten-year study of PCB contamination in the Hudson River, EPA proposed a plan to clean up the river by dredging more than 100,000 pounds (45,000 kg) of PCBs."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"The worst PCB hotspots are targeted for remediation by removing and disposing of more than 2.6 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment. The dredging project is the most aggressive environmental effort ever proposed to clean up a river, and will cost GE about $460,000,000. General Electric took the position that dredging the river would actually stir up PCBs. In 2002, EPA ordered GE to clean up a 40-mile (64 km) stretch of the Hudson River it had contaminated."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"EPA also announced that an additional 2,650,000 cubic yards (2,030,000 m3) of contaminated sediments in the upper Hudson River would be removed.GE began sediment dredging operations to clean up the PCBs on May 15, 2009. This stage (Phase One) of the cleanup was completed in October 2009, and was responsible for the removal of approximately 300,000 cubic yards (230,000 m3) of contaminated sediment, which was more than the targeted amount."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"Over 620 barges filled with sediment were transported to the processing facility on the Champlain Canal, and over 80 rail cars transported the dredged sediment to a waste facility in Andrews, Texas. The true scope of Phase One was about 100,000 cubic yards (76,000 m3) more than planned, and Phase Two was to be expanded as a consequence. Phase Two of the cleanup project, led by GE and monitored by EPA, began in June 2011, targeting approximately 2,400,000 cubic yards (1,800,000 m3) of PCB-contaminated sediment from a forty-mile section of the Upper Hudson River."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"Phase Two of the cleanup will take approximately 5 to 7 years to complete. In 2010, General Electric agreed to finance and conduct a second dredging campaign at the Upper Hudson River between Fort Edward and Troy. These works have been supervised by EPA.Although the cleanup has been slow, environmental advocacy groups have reached out to the general public on the condition of the river's pollution. Scenic Hudson, Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Hudson Riverkeeper, and the Natural Resources Defense Council have continued to push for more action from General Electric. After Seeger's death in 2014, EPA Regional Administrator Judith A."
 Types of pollution and other environmental impacts ,,"Enck stated that ""the incredible work"" of Seeger and the Clearwater organization helped make the Hudson River cleaner."
 Cleanup , Water quality improvement ,"The most recent comprehensive report on the health of the Hudson River, published in 2020, states that ""Water quality in the Hudson River Estuary has improved dramatically since 1972 and has remained largely stable in recent years.""

 Findings , Impact of the report ,"In 1987, the results of the report were used as the basis of an amendment to the Clean Water Act requiring local governments and industry to address the pollution sources indicated by the report. The amendment requires all industrial stormwater dischargers (including many construction sites) and municipal storm sewer systems, affecting virtually all cities and towns in the country, to obtain discharge permits. EPA published national stormwater regulations in 1990 and 1999. EPA and state agencies began issuing stormwater permits in 1991. See Stormwater management permits."
 Findings , Impact of the report ,"The term ""NURP ponds"" refers to retention basins (also called ""wet ponds"") that capture sediment from stormwater runoff as it is detained, and that are designed to perform to the level of the more effective ponds observed in the NURP studies. Some practitioners may assume that a ""NURP pond"" design conforms to some particular standard issued by EPA, but in fact EPA has issued no regulations or other requirements regarding the design of stormwater ponds."

 Description ,,"The Quakake Tunnel is located in Packer Township near the border between Carbon and Luzerne counties. The tunnel is located to the south of the borough of Beaver Meadows. It is approximately 3,900 feet (1,200 m) in length. The mouth of the tunnel is at Wetzel Creek and its waters ultimately enter the Delaware River. The tunnel's direction is mainly north and 60 degrees west and the other end of the tunnel is in coal mine workings belonging to the Lykens Vein."
 Description ,,"It drains part of the Spring Mountain coal workings as well as the Beaver Meadow and the Coleraine coal workings.The mouth of the Quakake Tunnel is slightly over 1,300 feet (400 m) above sea level. The upper end of the tunnel is not significantly higher.The Quakake Tunnel is one of four sources of acid mine drainage in Carbon County and one of eight in the watershed of the Lehigh River. The portal of the Quakake Tunnel is in severely fractured red shale. Timbering is required to support the tunnel at this location."
 Description ,,"Other varieties of rocks are found deeper into the tunnel. Sandstone belonging to the Pottsville Formation is found from 1,450 feet (440 m) above the mouth of the tunnel to 1,800 feet (550 m) above the mouth of the tunnel. From this area up to 2,000 feet (610 m) from the tunnel's mouth, the tunnel is mostly in conglomerate rock. There are few fractures in the rock in this part of the tunnel."
 Description ,,"From 2,100 to 2,200 feet (640 to 670 m), 3,300 to 3,400 feet (1,000 to 1,000 m), and 3,650 to 3,850 feet (1,110 to 1,170 m), there are more conglomerates. Other rock types found deeper than 2,000 feet (610 m) include red shale, gray shale, and sandstone.There are coal seams at the upper end of the Quakake Tunnel.The Quakake Tunnel is collapsed in places. Historically, there was also debris in the tunnel. A number of minor thrust faults are also found within the tunnel."
 Description ,,"A synclinal axis occurs at 1,900 feet (580 m) from the mouth and an anticlinal axis occurs at 2,800 feet (850 m) from the mouth. The tunnel is at the southeastern edge of the Jeansville Coal Basin.The water of the Quakake Tunnel comes from surface water that flows through broken strata and abandoned strip pits. The discharge of the Quakake Tunnel is greater than the acid mine drainage discharges that feed Hazle Creek at Stockton. The load of acidity in the tunnel is also greater than the aforementioned acid mine drainage discharges."
 Description ,,"The tunnel causes Wetzel Creek to be acidic as far downstream as its mouth. Between 1979 and 1980, the pH of the discharge of the Quakake Tunnel ranged from 3.4 to 4.6, with an average of 3.9. The total concentration of acidity ranged from 66 to 110 milligrams per liter, with an average of 80 milligrams per liter.Between 1979 and 1980, the concentration of aluminum in the waters of the Quakake Tunnel ranged between 5.5 and 17.0 milligrams per liter and averaged 9.8 milligrams per liter."
 Description ,,"The calcium concentration ranged from 6.0 to 39.8 milligrams per liter, with an average of 14.1 milligrams per liter. The iron concentration ranged from 0.18 to 0.97 milligrams per liter, with an average of 0.83 milligrams per liter. The concentration of sulfates ranged from 80 to 200 milligrams per liter, with an average of 144 milligrams per liter.Between 1973 and 1974, the discharge of the Quakake Tunnel ranged from 10.1 to 33.6 cubic feet per second, with an average of 21.3 cubic feet per second."
 Description ,,"The water temperature ranged from 9 to 10 °C (48 to 50 °F), with an average of 9 °C (48 °F). Between 1979 and 1980, the average water temperature of the tunnel's discharge was 9 °C (48 °F). As of 2008, the discharge of the tunnel is over 6000 gallons per minute (13.37 cubic feet per second), making it the largest abandoned mine discharge in the watershed of the Lehigh River."
 Description ,,"The Quakake Tunnel was constructed for the purpose of draining water from deep mines via gravity.A prototype installation of a treatment system for the Quakake Tunnel was constructed in 1978 and 1979.The Quakake Tunnel was cleared of debris by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection at some point in the past. After this, it was possible to access the tunnel between its lower end and its upper end for the purposes of mapping it."
 Description ,,"A study once suggested that it was possible to place a seal in the tunnel between 1,800 feet (550 m) and 2,000 feet (610 m) from its mouth.The treatment of the Quakake Tunnel ranks third in priority among eight acid mine drainage discharges in the watershed of the Lehigh River."

 History ,,"The parcel of land on which the landfill was established was purchased by John M. Bowers, a local dental surgeon, in 1957. The following year Bowers began a sand and gravel quarrying operation on the eastern edge of the land adjacent to Island Road. Shortly afterwards, the portion of land between the quarry and the Scioto River was utilized as a landfill, with soil from the quarry used to cover the refuse."
 Case overview ,,"On March 8, 2002, Utica High School Principal Richard Machesky asked the Arrow advisor to cut student reporter Katy Dean's story about school bus diesel emissions along with the adjoining cartoon and editorial, at the time claiming it was based on ""unreliable"" sources and was ""highly inaccurate."" After a year of asking school officials to reconsider their decision, Dean filed a lawsuit against the Utica Community Schools in federal court."
 Case overview ,,"On October 12, 2004, Judge Arthur Tarnow determined that ""The Arrow"" student newspaper was an example of a limited public forum after reviewing the degree of control school officials exercised over the paper, which ultimately separated this case from the decision expressed in Hazelwood. A limited public forum—in this context, a public forum created for use by student editors—can reasonably be regulated in terms of time, place, and manner of expression, but not on the substance of that expression."
 Case overview ,,"Tarnow also examined Dean's article and determined that there was not a ""significant disparity in quality between Dean's article in the Arrow and the similar articles in 'professional newspapers.'"" In addition to these two factors, the Judge decided that the school had censored the article in its own interest, by preventing the expression of its viewpoint, and then claiming it was ""inaccurate.""

 Regulation in the United States ,,"In the United States, facilities that discharge industrial stormwater to surface waters must obtain a permit under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), pursuant to the Clean Water Act. Stormwater permit regulations issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) govern the permit process. EPA published its ""Phase I"" stormwater rule, which covers industrial dischargers, in 1990.Most stormwater permits in the U.S. are issued by the agencies in 47 states that have been given authority by EPA. EPA regional offices issue the stormwater permits in the remaining parts of the country."

 Regulation in the United States , Multi-sector general permit ,"The other states have developed their own state-specific industrial stormwater permits (e.g. California's Industrial General Permit). State-issued general permits often include the same requirements as EPA's permit, but some states have additional requirements."
 Regulation in the United States , Construction site stormwater ,"Under EPA regulations, stormwater runoff from construction sites is also classified as industrial stormwater, however these discharges are covered by a separate set of permits. EPA periodically publishes its Construction General Permit and the approved state agencies publish similar permits, to regulate discharges from construction sites of 1 acre (4,000 m2) or more."
 Regulation in the United States , Construction site stormwater ,"(Also covered are sites that are less than one acre in size, that are part of a larger common plan of development that will disturb more than 1 acre.) In addition to implementing the NPDES requirements, many states and local governments have enacted their own stormwater management laws and ordinances, and some have published stormwater treatment design manuals. Some of these state and local requirements have expanded coverage beyond the federal requirements. For example, the State of Maryland requires erosion and sediment controls on construction sites of 5,000 sq ft (460 m2) or more."

 Legislative and regulation history , Clean Air Act of 1963 (CAA) ,"The Clean Air Act of 1963 (CAA) was passed as an extension of the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955, encouraging the federal government via the United States Public Health Service under the then-Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) to encourage research and development towards reducing pollution and working with states to establish their own emission reduction programs. The CAA was amended in 1965 with the Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act (MVAPCA) which gave the HEW Secretary authority to set federal standards for vehicle emissions as early as 1967."
 Legislative and regulation history , California Air Resources Board (CARB) ,"In the mid-20th century, California's economy grew rapidly after the Great Depression, but this economic development was accompanied by an increase in air pollution in the state. As a result, smog started to form in the valleys of Southern California, causing respiratory problems for humans and damaging crops.In the 1960s, Dutch chemist Arie Jan Haagen-Smit identified the air pollutants responsible for the smog: carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides emitted from cars and factories through inefficient fuel combustion. Haagen-Smit also discovered that these air pollutants react with sunlight to form ozone, a major component of smog."
 Legislative and regulation history , California Air Resources Board (CARB) ,"As a response to this situation, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) was established in 1967 with Haagen-Smit as its first chairman. CARB set stringent vehicle emission standards to reduce air pollution in the state."
 Legislative and regulation history , California Air Resources Board (CARB) ,"California established the California Air Resources Board (CARB) in 1967, with Haagen-Smit as its first chairman, which among other activities set stringent vehicle emission standards by that year.Other states were also facing similar air pollution issues at the same time, but fearing that setting too strict a standard would drive away automobile manufacturers, they considered implementing standards that were less restrictive compared to California, potentially creating a patchwork of regulations across the United States."
 Legislative and regulation history , California Air Resources Board (CARB) ,"The automobile industry lobbied to Congress, and the CAA was modified in 1967 with the National Emissions Standards Act (also known as the Air Quality Act) that expressly prevented states from setting more restrictive emission standards than the federal levels. However, because California has already established its program, it was granted a waiver and allowed to keep its standards. This Act did give states the authority to perform vehicle inspections programs beyond the requirements for new vehicles, though few states took their own action on this."
 Legislative and regulation history , Formation of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Clear Air Act Amendment of 1970 ,"Air pollution had become a major national focal point by 1970, leading to a major amendment to the CAA. Near the end of 1970, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was formed out of an executive order under President Richard Nixon with ratification by Congress to consolidate all of the environmental-related executive-branch programs to a single entity; the new agency was reflect as the primary agency for administering the CAA going forward."
 Legislative and regulation history , Formation of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Clear Air Act Amendment of 1970 ,"Among the provisions related to vehicle emissions: The 1970 Amendment required EPA to define the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), to be set and updated by the EPA. The NAAQS, at passage of the 1970 amendment, included the pollutants carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons and photochemical oxidants (such as ozone). Other pollutants, such as lead, were added later based on EPA review of current conditions. Along with the other activities set by the EPA, the states were to create State Implementation Plans (SIP)s to bring their air quality within the NAAQS by 1975."
 Legislative and regulation history , Formation of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Clear Air Act Amendment of 1970 ,"The Amendment also required the EPA to define emission standards for new vehicles to help with the NAAQS emission reduction goals, including standards for fuel and testing of new vehicles to make sure these standards are met.Additionally, the 1970 CAA Amendment continued California's waiver program through which California can seek exemptions from the EPA's emissions requirements as long as theirs are at least as strict as the EPA's vehicle standards."
 Legislative and regulation history , Clear Air Act Amendment of 1977 ,"The EPA's assessment of the state of the country meeting the target NAAQS goals by 1975 was poor, having identified numerous nonattainment areas in the country. With the 1977 Amendment to the CAA, a new deadline of December 31, 1982, for meeting the NAAQS was fixed with no allowance for extending the deadline unless specific control measures were established. Among other key provisions was the establishment of required vehicle inspection and maintenance programs (I/M) in nonattainment states and optional in other areas."
 Legislative and regulation history , Clear Air Act Amendment of 1977 ,"This required that states establish emission testing facilities for in-use vehicles to make sure they meet emissions requirements, maintained and repaired as necessary to correct any problems before their license was renewed. The EPA was tasked to establish the basic protocols for these facilities. Other states that had met the NAAQS attainment goals could optionally establish I/M programs for existing but were required to follow the EPA's specifications. Due to its preexisting standards and particularly severe motor vehicle air pollution problems in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the U.S."
 Legislative and regulation history , Clear Air Act Amendment of 1977 ,"state of California has special dispensation from the federal government to promulgate its own automobile emissions standards. Other states may choose to follow either the national standard or the stricter California standards. The states that have adopted the California standards are: Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico (2011 model year and later), New York, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont, and Washington (2009 model year and later), as well as the District of Columbia."
 Legislative and regulation history , Clear Air Act Amendment of 1977 ,"Such states are frequently referred to as ""CARB states"" in automotive discussions because the regulations are defined by the California Air Resources Board. The EPA adopted the Californian fuel economy and greenhouse gas standard as a national standard by the 2016 model year and collaborated with Californian regulators on stricter national emissions standards for model years 2017–2025."
 New vehicle emission standards , Light-duty vehicles ,"Light-duty vehicles are certified for compliance with emission standards by measuring their tailpipe emissions during rigorously-defined driving cycles that simulate a typical driving pattern. The FTP-75 city driving test (averaging about 21 miles per hour (34 km/h)) and the HWFET highway driving test (averaging about 48 miles per hour (77 km/h)) are used for measuring both emissions and fuel economy. Two sets, or tiers, of emission standards for light-duty vehicles in the United States were defined as a result of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990."
 New vehicle emission standards , Light-duty vehicles ,"The Tier I standard was adopted in 1991 and was phased in from 1994 to 1997. Tier II standards were phased in from 2004 to 2009. Within the Tier II ranking, there is a subranking ranging from BIN 1–10, with 1 being the cleanest (Zero Emission vehicle) and 10 being the dirtiest. The former Tier 1 standards that were effective from 1994 until 2003 were different between automobiles and light trucks (SUVs, pickup trucks, and minivans), but Tier II standards are the same for both types."
 New vehicle emission standards , Light-duty vehicles ,"These standards specifically restrict emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), particulate matter (PM), formaldehyde (HCHO), and non-methane organic gases (NMOG) or non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC). The limits are defined in grams per mile (g/mi)."
 New vehicle emission standards , Phase 1: 1994–1999 ,"These standards were phased in from 1994 to 1997 and were phased out in favor of the national Tier 2 standard from 2004 to 2009. Tier I standards cover vehicles with a gross vehicular weight rating (GVWR) below 8,500 pounds (3,856 kg) and are divided into five categories: one for passenger cars, and four for light-duty trucks (which include SUVs and minivans) divided up based on the vehicle weight and cargo capacity. California's Low-emission vehicle (LEV) program defines six automotive emission standards which are stricter than the United States' national Tier regulations."
 New vehicle emission standards , Phase 1: 1994–1999 ,"Each standard has several targets depending on vehicle weight and cargo capacity; the regulations cover vehicles with test weights up to 14,000 pounds (6,400 kg). Listed in order of increasing stringency, the standards are: TLEV – Transitional low-emission vehicle LEV – Low-emission vehicle ULEV – Ultra-low-emission vehicle SULEV – Super-ultra low-emission vehicle ZEV – Zero-emission vehicleThe last category is largely restricted to electric vehicles and hydrogen cars, although such vehicles are usually not entirely non-polluting."
 New vehicle emission standards , Phase 1: 1994–1999 ,"In those cases, the other emissions are transferred to another site, such as a power plant or hydrogen reforming center, unless such sites run on renewable energy."
 New vehicle emission standards , Transitional NLEV: 1999–2003 ,"A set of transitional and initially voluntary ""national low emission vehicle"" (NLEV) standards were in effect starting in 1999 for northeastern states and 2001 in the rest of the country until Tier II, adopted in 1999, began to be phased in from 2004 onwards. The National Low Emission Vehicle program covered vehicles below 6,000 pounds (2,700 kg) GVWR and adapted the national standards to accommodate California's stricter regulations."
 New vehicle emission standards , Phase 2: 2004–2009 ,"Instead of basing emissions on vehicle weight, Tier II standards are divided into several numbered ""bins"". Eleven bins were initially defined, with bin 1 being the cleanest (zero-emission vehicle) and 11 the dirtiest. However, bins 9, 10, and 11 are temporary. Only the first ten bins were used for light-duty vehicles below 8,500 pounds (3,900 kg) GVWR, but medium-duty passenger vehicles up to 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) GVWR and to all 11 bins. Manufacturers can make vehicles which fit into any of the available bins, but still must meet average targets for their entire fleets."
 New vehicle emission standards , Phase 2: 2004–2009 ,"The two least-restrictive bins for passenger cars, 9 and 10, were phased out at the end of 2006. However, bins 9 and 10 were available for classifying a restricted number of light-duty trucks until the end of 2008, when they were removed along with bin 11 for medium-duty vehicles. As of 2009, light-duty trucks must meet the same emissions standards as passenger cars. Tier II regulations also defined restrictions for the amount of sulfur allowed in gasoline and diesel fuel, since sulfur can interfere with the operation of advanced exhaust treatment systems such as selective catalytic converters and diesel particulate filters."
 New vehicle emission standards , Phase 2: 2004–2009 ,"Sulfur content in gasoline was limited to an average of 120 parts-per-million (maximum 300 ppm) in 2004, and this was reduced to an average 30 ppm (maximum 80 ppm) for 2006. Ultra-low sulfur diesel began to be restricted to a maximum 15 ppm in 2006 and refiners are to be 100% compliant with that level by 2010. A second round of California standards, known as Low Emission Vehicle II, is timed to coordinate with the Tier 2 rollout."
 New vehicle emission standards , Phase 2: 2004–2009 ,"The PZEV and AT-PZEV ratings are for vehicles which achieve a SULEV II rating and also have systems to eliminate evaporative emissions from the fuel system and which have 150,000-mile/15-year warranties on emission-control components. Several ordinary gasoline vehicles from the 2001 and later model years qualify as PZEVs. If a PZEV has technology that can also be used in ZEVs like an electric motor or high-pressure gaseous fuel tanks for compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquified petroleum gas (LPG), it qualifies as an AT-PZEV. Diesel particulate filters became a requirement in 2014; gasoline vehicles were exempt."
 New vehicle emission standards , Tier III ,The phase-in of new tailpipe and evaporative emission standards begin to phase-in beginning with the 2017 model year along with new fuel standards.
 New vehicle emission standards , Heavy-duty vehicles ,Heavy-duty vehicles must comply with more stringent exhaust emission standards and requires ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel (15 ppm maximum) beginning in 2007 model year.
 New vehicle emission standards , Greenhouse gases ,"Federal emissions regulations cover the primary component of vehicle exhaust, carbon dioxide (CO2). Since CO2 emissions are proportional to the amount of fuel used, the national Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations were historically the primary way in which automotive CO2 emissions were regulated in the U.S. The EPA faced a lawsuit seeking to compel it to regulate greenhouse gases as a pollutant, Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency."
 New vehicle emission standards , Greenhouse gases ,"As of 2007, the California Air Resources Board passed strict greenhouse gas emission standards which are being challenged in the courts.On September 12, 2007, a judge in Vermont ruled in favor of allowing states to conditionally regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from new cars and trucks, defeating an attempt by automakers to block state emissions standards. A group of automakers including General Motors, DaimlerChrysler, and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers had sued the state of Vermont to block rules calling for a 30 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2016."
 New vehicle emission standards , Greenhouse gases ,"Members of the auto industry argued that complying with these regulations would require major technological advances and raise the prices of vehicles as much as $6,000 per automobile. U.S. District Judge William K. Sessions III dismissed these claims in his ruling. ""The court remains unconvinced automakers cannot meet the challenge of Vermont and California's (greenhouse gas) regulations,"" he wrote. Environmentalists pressed the Administration to grant California a waiver from the EPA for its emissions standards to take effect. Doing so would allow Vermont and other states to adopt these same standards under the Clean Air Act."
 New vehicle emission standards , Greenhouse gases ,"Without such a waiver, Judge Sessions wrote, the Vermont rules will be invalid."
 New vehicle emission standards , 2010–2016 ,"In 2009, President Obama announced a new national fuel economy and emissions policy that incorporated California's contested plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions on its own, apart from federal government regulations. The standards are formatted such that each vehicle has an emissions target as a function of the product of its wheelbase and average track width with separate functions for passenger cars and light trucks with progressively smaller targets by model year. Thus each manufacturer has a unique standard for each model year based on the characteristics of vehicles it actually produces."
 New vehicle emission standards , 2010–2016 ,"The new standards established a credit trading system whereby manufacturers that overperform their annual target may sell credits to other manufacturers which they then may use to meet a credit shortfall it has from failing to meet its standards through emissions improvements. The combined fleet fuel economy for new cars and trucks with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) or less was projected to average 35.5 miles per gallon (mpg) for the 2016 model year based on the newly-established targets and projected fleet mix."
 New vehicle emission standards , 2010–2016 ,"The average for its cars will have to be 42 mpg, and for its trucks will be 26 mpg by 2016, in coordination with new CAFE standards. If the average fuel economy of a manufacturer's annual fleet of vehicle production falls below its defined standard, the manufacturer must pay a penalty, then US$5.50 per 0.1 mpg under the standard, multiplied by the manufacturer's total production for the U.S. domestic market."
 New vehicle emission standards , 2010–2016 ,"This is in addition to any gas guzzler tax, if applicable.Should CAFE targets have been extended through to 2026 under the Obama administration, it would have sought a 54 mpg industry-wide average fuel efficiency for cars and light trucks manufactured in 2026 or later, with automobile manufacturers instructed to increase the fuel economy across all of their vehicles by 5% each year."
 New vehicle emission standards , Trump-era rollback and Biden-era reversal (2017–2021) ,"After Donald Trump was inaugurated as president in 2017, he instructed the NHTSA and EPA to rollback Obama's CAFE standards, increasing the 2026 target to a then-projected 202 g CO2/mi and requiring only an annual 1.5% fleet efficiency improvement. The new rule was issued in March 2020. The Trump administration argued the rollback was required due to the increasing costs of cars on consumers that higher efficiencies would only make more expensive."

 New vehicle emission standards , Air pollution score ,"EPA's air pollution score represents the amount of health-damaging and smog-forming airborne pollutants the vehicle emits. Scoring ranges from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). The pollutants considered are nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (HCHO), and various hydrocarbon measures – non-methane organic gases (NMOG), and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), and total hydrocarbons (THC). This score does not include emissions of greenhouse gases (but see Greenhouse gas score, below)."
 New vehicle emission standards , Greenhouse gas score ,"EPA's greenhouse gas score reflects the amount of greenhouse gases a vehicle will produce over its lifetime, based on typical consumer usage. The scoring is from 0 to 10, where 10 represents the lowest amount of greenhouse gases. The Greenhouse gas score is determined from the vehicle's estimated fuel economy and its fuel type. The lower the fuel economy, the more greenhouse gas is emitted as a by-product of combustion. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted per liter or gallon burned varies by fuel type, since each type of fuel contains a different amount of carbon per gallon or liter."
 New vehicle emission standards , Greenhouse gas score ,"The ratings reflect carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions, weighted to reflect each gas's relative contribution to the greenhouse effect."
 New vehicle emission standards , California emission standards ,"Under Section 209 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), California is given the ability to apply for special waivers to apply its own emission standards for new motor vehicles that are at least as stringent as the federal standards. California applies for this waiver through the EPA, which publishes the proposed standards for public review in the Federal Register."
 New vehicle emission standards , California emission standards ,"Based on its own review and public comments, the EPA then grants the waiver unless it has determined that California's requested standards were ""arbitrary and capricious"" in their findings, that the standards are not needed to ""meet compelling and extraordinary conditions"", or otherwise are inconsistent with other aspects of the CAA. Since the CAA's passage in 1967, California has applied and received more than fifty waivers, which include emission standards across various vehicle classes. Among these include two special sets of waivers: California initiated its zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate in 1990."
 New vehicle emission standards , California emission standards ,"ZEV are defined as vehicles that have no exhaust or evaporative emissions of any regulated pollutant. Vehicle manufacturers were a percentage of their fleet meeting these ZEV standards over a long-term schedule (2% by model year 1998 at its start), but the mandate schedule has shifted based on the unplanned rate of technology advancement and costs, and as of 2020, its current target is to reach 8% ZEV by 2025 determined by fleet credits that account for vehicle range as well as contributions from any low-emission vehicles or plug-in hybrids. The EPA granted the initial request in 1990 and several updates."
 New vehicle emission standards , California emission standards ,California had requested to regulate greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) at stricter levels than federal levels first in 2005 as part of its low-emission vehicle program. The EPA initially refused this waiver based on a decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that determined the EPA did not have the authority to regulate GHG under the CAA; this ruling was challenged in the Supreme Court case Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency (549 U.S. 497 (2007)) which ruled that the EPA did have this authority.
 New vehicle emission standards , California emission standards ,"In later actions, the EPA granted California its GHG waiver by 2009."
 New vehicle emission standards , State adoption of California Standards ,"Section 177 of the CAA grants the ability for states to adopt California emission standards instead of federal ones. As of December 2021, the following states have adopted the California standards, including their standards for ZEV and GHG:"
 New vehicle emission standards , Revocation of waivers under the Trump administration ,"Former President Donald Trump stated his concern about California's stricter emission standards and their impact on the costs of manufacturing on the automobile industry, though some political analysts asserted this also tied in with Trump's conservative ideology conflicting with California's more liberal stance. Along with the Obama-era mileage goals, Trump had expressed his intent to revoke California's waivers early on in his presidency.Shortly after Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW announced their intentions to commit to the Obama-era mileage goals and California's emission standards across their fleets in July 2019, Trump announced his intention to rollback California's waivers."
 New vehicle emission standards , Revocation of waivers under the Trump administration ,"As part of Trump's Safer, Affordable, Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) program, the EPA and NHTSA proposed a new ""One National Program Rule"" that asserted that only the federal government may set emissions standards on September 19, 2019, as to have one consistent set of fuel emission and mileage standards across the country. This rule would include revoking the last set of California waivers that the EPA had granted California in 2013 for its GHG and ZEV programs."
 New vehicle emission standards , Revocation of waivers under the Trump administration ,"California retained its ability to set emission standards that address ozone-formation under the rule.Subsequent to this rule, California led a collation of 23 states to sue the NHTSA in California v. Chao (Case 1:19-cv-02826) in the D.C. District Court in September 2019, asserting the agency, in setting the rule, violated the intent of the CAA. The same group of states also filed suit against the EPA once the EPA issued the revoking of the 2013 waiver in November 2019, in California v."
 New vehicle emission standards , Revocation of waivers under the Trump administration ,"Wheeler (Case 19-1239) in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to challenge the EPA's revoking. Further, both Minnesota and New Mexico, plaintiffs in both cases, stated they would take steps to adapt California's standards in their states as a result.Following the election of Joe Biden as president, the EPA and NHTSA moved to reverse the 2019 rule in April 2021, thus returning to the previous status quo for California."
 New vehicle emission standards , Revocation of waivers under the Trump administration ,"Following the EPA granting California its latest request for exemption, seventeen states sued the EPA in May 2022, arguing that because of the impact of California emission standards on vehicle manufacturing, the EPA's actions violate the equal sovereignty granted to the states by the Constitution, since it gives California more power than other states in setting emissions regulations. Non-road engines, including equipment and vehicles that are not operated on the public roadways, are used in an extremely wide range of applications, each involving great differences in operating characteristics and engine technology."
 New vehicle emission standards , Revocation of waivers under the Trump administration ,"Emissions from all non-road engines are regulated by categories.In the United States, the emission standards for non-road diesel engines are published in the US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 89 (40 CFR Part 89). Tier 1–3 Standards were adopted in 1994 and was phased in between 1996 and 2000 for engines over 37 kW (50 hp). In 1998 the regulation included engines under 37 kW and introduced more stringent Tier 2 and Tier 3 standards which was scheduled to be phased in between 2000 and 2008."
 New vehicle emission standards , Revocation of waivers under the Trump administration ,"In 2004, US EPA introduced the more stringent Tier 4 standards which was scheduled to be phased in between 2008 and 2015. The testing cycles used for certification follow the ISO 8178 standards. Pollution from small engines, such as those used in gas-powered groundskeeping equipment reduces air quality. Emissions from small offroad engines are regulated by the EPA. Specific pollutants subject to limits include hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. Testing of existing vehicle emissions, also known as vehicle inspection and maintenance programs (I/M) were introduced as part of the 1977 Amendments to the CAA."
 New vehicle emission standards , Revocation of waivers under the Trump administration ,"The 1970 Amendments introduced target NAAQS goals for air quality which were not met in many parts of the country. With the 1977 Amendments, the CAA required I/M programs in non-attainment states as part of their pollution prevent plans. For model years prior to 1996, emissions tests were performed using a chassis dynamometer-based test; The vehicle is driven so that the wheels of its main driven axle (front or rear) sit atop the dynamometer rotors, when then are unlocked to rotate freely."
 New vehicle emission standards , Revocation of waivers under the Trump administration ,"A special collections line is attached to the tailpipe, and simulated airflow is pushed across the engine to simulate vehicle movement. The test operator then presses the accelerator of the car through a fixed test schedule: the acceleration from the engine translates to force and torque that are measured through the dynamometer, simultaneously mapped against analysis of the emissions from the tailpipe. After completion of the schedule, the computerized system calculates the emissions from the car and determines if it meets the appropriate specification for its model year."
 New vehicle emission standards , Revocation of waivers under the Trump administration ,"Since model year 1994, all LDV and LDT manufactured for use in the United States are required to use the standard on-board diagnostic OBD-II system. This is a computerized system that continually monitors the performance of the engine and its emission control system. Instead of the dynamometer test, the operator hooks the OBD-II to a standard computer system which downloads the information from the computer. It will warn the operator if the OBD-II determines significant deviations from expected emissions control standards, indicating repairs may be needed."

 Major New Source Review court cases , Wisconsin Energy Corporation lawsuit ,"In 1988 the Wisconsin Energy Corporation (WEPCo) submitted an NSR inquiry to the EPA for improvements at its Port Washington plant. The improvements included the replacement and repair of aging equipment including steam turbine generators, major boiler components and significant amounts of asbestos remediation. WEPCo initially believed that the plant, built in 1932, would not be subject to the NSR requirements and would instead fall under ""routine maintenance, repair, and replacement""."
 Major New Source Review court cases , Wisconsin Energy Corporation lawsuit ,"The EPA, however, ruled that the improvements would extend the life of the plant, and constitute a long term and significant increase in the facilities emissions, prompting WEPCo to sue the EPA in federal court.In 1991 the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals found that the EPA had improperly interpreted the NSR and ruled that work that ""does not 'change or alter' the design or nature of the facility"", would render the facility exempt from the NSR rules."
 Major New Source Review court cases , Wisconsin Energy Corporation lawsuit ,"Rather, it merely allows the facility to operate again as it had before the specific equipment deteriorated."" The appeals court also ruled that WEPCo would not emit any more pollutants after the improvements, and agreed with WEPCo that its emissions would actually decrease and that the EPA had miscalculated its estimation of the plants emissions."
 Major New Source Review court cases , Wisconsin Energy Corporation lawsuit ,"However the court did agree with the EPA that the repairs and modifications to the plant did not constitute ""routine maintenance"" After the WEPCo ruling, the EPA continued to take a case-by-case approach to NSR's at facilities built before 1977, viewing the court's ruling as applying to the power sector specifically and not to all similar NSR applications in general."
 Major New Source Review court cases , Duke Energy ,"Between 1998 and 2000, Charlotte based Duke Energy made 29 modifications and upgrades to several of its coal-generated units. These modifications, like the ones at WEPCo, had no impact on unit emission and were designed to replace or upgrade older equipment. Duke did not apply for or obtain permits from the EPA for this work, and were sued."
 Major New Source Review court cases , Duke Energy ,"The EPA argued that the modifications and upgrades could significantly increase the dispatch capacity of the units, and allow them to operate at higher outputs for longer periods of time, placing Duke in excess of the EPA's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD), requiring an automatic NSR.Duke Energy initially prevailed in both the trial as well as the appeal in front of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, when they ruled that the EPA's rulings were inconsistent with prior decisions and that the EPA's previous interpretation of the NSR would also have to be applied to its application of its PSD rule."
 Major New Source Review court cases , Duke Energy ,"The EPA, along with the North Carolina Sierra Club appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which in a unanimous decision, overturned the Fourth Circuit's decision. The Court ruled the term ""modification"" did not have the same meaning in the PSD and NSPS provisions."
 Major New Source Review court cases , Bush administration ,"Environmental groups expressed strong anger toward the EPA's decision in August 2003 to significantly relax the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act, arguing that it will substantially harm the quality of the air, increase respiratory ailments, such as asthma, and cause thousands of premature deaths. Furthermore, a report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said that the EPA had relied not on scientific evidence but merely on anecdotal evidence from utilities to build a case for the new law."
 Major New Source Review court cases , Bush administration ,"Because the changes to the New Source Review substantially weaken the Clean Air Act's ability to prevent pollution and cause many existing enforcement efforts to be dropped, twelve states (New York, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin) and the District of Columbia sued the Bush Administration in October 2003 to block the changes to the New Source Review that are seen as a major rollback of the Clean Air Act and a hazard to public health."
 Major New Source Review court cases , Bush administration ,"On December 24, 2003, a federal court ruled that the new NSR rules could not go into effect until the lawsuit had been fully adjudicated. When the new rules were being proposed, the EPA administrator claimed that the new rules would not stop any enforcement actions against utilities that had been started under the previous administration and were still ongoing, but shortly after the rules were adopted, the EPA decided to drop most of those lawsuits. In the 1990s, EPA began an initiative to enforce new source review requirements against coal-fired power plants."
 Major New Source Review court cases , Bush administration ,The EPA effort was often supplemented by separate enforcement actions filed by the states and non-governmental organizations filing or intervening as co-plaintiffs under private causes of action in the Clean Air Act. Defendant's opposed states serving as intervenors and co-plaintiffs arguing that plaintiffs were interpreting the law more stringently than it was designed. The results of the initiative varied.

 Site description ,,"The 102nd Street landfill consists of two parcels, one owned by Olin Corporation and one owned by Hooker Chemical & Plastics Corporation at an area of 22.1 acres (89,000 m2) total. Unlike Love Canal, which it is directly south of, the facility is still owned by Hooker (Occidental) and Olin, which are in the process of cleaning it up. It is part of the original canal excavation from which the Love Canal landfill takes its name. It currently appears to be a large field, as the chemicals are sealed off and buried underneath the soil."
 Site description ,,"Griffon Park lies directly west, and currently, little residential development lies on either side of the area. The area is monitored with air and ground monitoring devices to measure the toxicity of the site. At an unknown date, chemicals began seeping into the Niagara River. A concrete bulkhead has been constructed on the shore to stop the seepage of chemicals into the river. The area is fenced off by a six-foot-tall (1.8 m) chain-linked fence on all sides. The landfill takes its name from 102nd Street, a street that ran through the area before residents were evacuated and homes demolished."
 Site description ,,"The larger portion owned by Hooker was operated from 1943 until 1971. In that time period, 23,500 short tons (21,300 t) of mixed organic and/or inorganic compounds, solvents and phosphates, and related chemicals were dumped here including brine sludge, fly ash, electrochemical cell parts and related equipment plus 300 short tons (270 t) of hexachlorocyclohexane process cake, including lindane. The smaller portion owned by Olin Corp. operated from 1948 to 1970."
 Site description ,,"6,600 short tons (6,000 t) of compounds and elements and an additional 20,000 short tons (18,000 t) of mercury brine and brine sludge, 1,000+ short tons (910+ t) tons of hazardous chemicals, 16 short tons (15 t) of concrete boiler ash, fly ash and other residual materials were deposited. Currently, according to the EPA, a wall has been built to keep this garbage from leaking into the Great Lakes. Thousands of tons of waste still reside at the site.

 Scope ,,"There are four categories of certification: A technician with the required level of certification may also legally purchase regulated refrigerants. And technicians who violate the Clean Air Act provisions may be fined, lose their certification, and may be required to appear in Federal court. In general, along with general enforcement provisions, section 608 manages the following regulatory requirements: Technician certification Refrigerant recovery and recycling techniques and procedures Leak checking Sales restrictions and venting prohibitions - Listing of chemicals that fall under these requirements is part of the Significant New Alternatives Policy program Record keeping requirements Disposal and safety Reclamation Service practices."
 Provisions , Recovery level ,"For Type I systems the main requirement is to remove 80% of the refrigerant if the appliance's compressor is not running and 90% if running and evacuate to a 4 inch Hg vacuum. For Type II or Type III applications, the appliance must be evacuated to the following levels for device manufactured after November 15, 1993 in order to recover the refrigerant Where pressure classification of the refrigerant is defined by the refrigerant's pressure at 104F as"
 Provisions , Recording Requirements ,"For systems containing 50 lbs or more of refrigerant, for each service, the owner must be supplied with information of: Date of service Type of service Type of refrigerant purchased Quantity of refrigerant addedAnd such records must be held for 3 years.Additionally, if an appliance leaks more than 125% of refrigerant, it must be reported to the EPA."
 Provisions , Leak Repair Requirements ,"Leaks must be repaired in systems with greater than 50 lbs of refrigerant if the leak rate exceeds In which case, they must be repaired within 30 days/120 if industrial process shutdown is required. An initial verification test must then be done within 30/120 days, and then a follow-up test within 10 days of that. There are additional clauses for extensions if needed. If the leak is not to be repaired, there must be a plan to retire or retrofit the appliance within 30 days, to be completed within one year."
 Provisions , Leak Repair Requirements ,"If more than a year is required, a report must be submitted, which must include: Estimated date(s) of completion The type of process The leak rate Method to determine the leak Full unit charge Date of discovery Location of leaks Repair work Plan for retrofitting or retiring the system Why more than one year is necessary Date of notification to the EPA"
 Provisions , Leak Inspection Regulations ,"Additional leak inspection frequencies following a leak must regard the following until the leak rate is within acceptable levels: These leak inspections may be bypassed if the system is installed with an automatic leak detection system. EPA regulations require the test to be a ""closed book"" proctored exam. The only outside materials allowed are a temperature / pressure chart, scratch paper and a calculator. The certification exam contains 4 sections: Core, Type I, Type II, and Type III. Each section contains 25 multiple choice questions."
 Provisions , Leak Inspection Regulations ,The technician must achieve a passing score of 70% in each Type in which they are to be certified. All technicians must pass the CORE section before receiving any certification. A technician seeking certification must correctly answer 18 out of 25 questions on the CORE and at least one other section of the exam. A technician seeking Universal certification must correctly answer 18 out of 25 questions on each section of the exam.
 Provisions , Leak Inspection Regulations ,"In addition to covering EPA (in particular, Section 608) regulations, the exam also covers basic safety and occupational practices, along with fundamental concepts of stratospheric ozone protection (which are typically part of the Core exam).Many universities and colleges also have associate degrees and apprenticeship programs that teach HVAC fundamentals along with providing EPA examinations."

 Overview ,,"A BART review is required by sections 169A and 169B of the Clean Air Act for pollution sources which might cause haze in a ""Federal Class 1 area"". An example of such a source is the Navajo Generating Station in Page, Arizona which could affect visibility in Grand Canyon National Park. BART provisions were included in the ""Clean Air Visibility Rule,"" published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1999, and amended in 2005. The Clean Air Act defines Best available retrofit technology:..."
 Overview ,,"in determining best available retrofit technology the State (or the Administrator in determining emission limitations which reflect such technology) shall take into consideration the costs of compliance, the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance, any existing pollution control technology in use at the source, the remaining useful life of the source, and the degree of improvement in visibility which may reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of such technology; A BART review may take into account the interests of stakeholders associated with the source."
 Overview ,,"In the case of Navajo Generating Station, EPA solicited input from stakeholders: the Department of the Interior, the Central Arizona Project, the Navajo Nation, the Gila River Indian Community, the Salt River Project, the Environmental Defense Fund, and Western Resources Advocates. A technical working group negotiated a ""Reasonable Progress Alternative to BART"" which was submitted by the Department of the Interior to the EPA on July 26, 2013 for consideration in development of a final rule."

 Introduction , Definition ,"Water pollution is the contamination of natural water bodies by chemical, physical, radioactive or pathogenic microbial substances. Point sources of water pollution are described by the CWA as ""any discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance from which pollutants are or may be discharged."" These include pipes or man-made ditches from stationary locations such as sewage treatment plants, factories, industrial wastewater treatment facilities, septic systems, ships, and other sources that are clearly discharging pollutants into water sources."
 Introduction , Relevant science ,"The input of pollutants into a water body may impact the water's ability to deliver ecological, recreational, educational, and economic services. While the impacts of water pollution vary considerably based on a variety of site-specific factors, they may be either direct or indirect. Pollutants that are directly toxic pose a threat to organisms that may come into contact with contaminated water. These include persistent organic pollutants used as pesticides and toxic byproducts of industrial activity (such as cyanide). Other pollutants may indirectly impact ecosystem services by causing a change in water conditions that allows for a harmful activity to take place."
 Introduction , Relevant science ,"This includes sediment (loose soil) inputs that decrease the amount of light that can penetrate through the water, reducing plant growth and diminishing oxygen availability for other aquatic organisms.There are a variety of water quality parameters that may be affected by point source water pollution. They include: dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), temperature, pH, turbidity, phosphorus, nitrates, total suspended solids, conductivity, alkalinity, and fecal coliform. BOD is perhaps the most widely used metric to assess water quality.Water quality is also closely linked with water quantity issues."
 Introduction , Relevant science ,"Water shortages from natural and anthropogenic activity reduce the dilutive properties of water and may concentrate water pollution. Conversely, during flooding events, water pollution may spread to previously uncontaminated waters through surface overflow or the failure of man-made barriers."
 Introduction , Water pollution incidents and public response ,"Before the CWA was enacted, companies indiscriminately discharged their effluents into water bodies. One such water body was the Cuyahoga River located in north-east Ohio. The river was thrust into the national limelight in 1969 when it caught fire, although the river had been plagued by fires since 1936. Pollution of the river had become prevalent in the early 1800s as contaminants from municipal and industrial discharges, bank erosion, commercial/residential development, atmospheric deposition, hazardous waste disposal sites, urban storm water runoff, combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and wastewater treatment plant bypasses were discharged into the river."
 Introduction , Water pollution incidents and public response ,"Time magazine described the Cuyahoga as the river that ""oozes rather than flows"" and in which a person ""does not drown but decays."" The 1969 river fire, and the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill in California—the largest such spill in U.S. history at that time—drew significant public attention to the state of the nation's waterways."
 Introduction , Water pollution incidents and public response ,"Although Congress had been holding hearings and considering additional pollution control legislation in the late 1960s, these widely publicized incidents increased the pressure on Congress to act, which they eventually did with the 1972 Clean Water Act, the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and later the Oil Pollution Act of 1990."
 Regulatory framework , History of regulation ,"The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 contained provisions that made discharging refuse matter into navigable waters of the United States illegal without a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The focus of the law was controlling obstructions to navigation, such as dumping refuse into rivers, and discharging oil from ships and boats. Most legal analysts have concluded that the 1899 law did not address environmental impacts from pollution, such as sewage or industrial discharges."
 Regulatory framework , History of regulation ,"However, there were several pollution enforcement cases in the 1960s and 1970s where the law was cited for broader pollution control objectives, prior to passage of the 1972 Clean Water Act.By the mid-20th century, water pollution laws in the United States began to include health- and use-based standards to protect environmental and economic interests. In 1948 Congress passed the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA)."
 Regulatory framework , History of regulation ,"The law authorized the Surgeon General and the Public Health Service to develop programs to combat pollution that was harming surface and underground water sources, but did not create any new regulatory or enforcement authority for pollution control. The FWPCA also authorized cooperation between federal and state agencies to construct municipal sewage treatment plants. The Water Quality Act of 1965 required states to issue water quality standards for interstate waters, and authorized the newly created Federal Water Pollution Control Administration to set standards where states failed to do so."
 Regulatory framework , History of regulation ,"No mechanism for federal enforcement was established.The 1966 Clean Water Restoration Act authorized a study to determine the effects of pollution on wildlife, recreation, and water supplies. The Act also set forth guidelines for abatement of water that may flow into international territory and prohibited the dumping of oil into navigable waters of the United States.The Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970 required the development of certain water quality standards and expanded federal authority in upholding the standards. The most substantial amendments to the FWPCA occurred in 1972 and became known as the Clean Water Act."
 Regulatory framework , Clean Water Act ,"Point source water pollution is largely regulated through the Clean Water Act, which gives the EPA the authority to set limits on the acceptable amount of pollutants that can be discharged into waters of the United States. The 1972 law also created federal authority for a permit system—NPDES—to enforce the pollution standards."
 Regulatory framework , Clean Water Act ,"The Act broadly defines a pollutant as any type of industrial, municipal, and agricultural waste discharged into water, such as: dredged soil, solid waste, incinerator residue, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical wastes, biological materials, radioactive materials, heat, wrecked or discarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and industrial, municipal, and agricultural waste. Point source water pollution is discharged into waters through both direct and indirect methods."
 Regulatory framework , Direct dischargers ,"Direct discharges are pollutants that are discharged directly to a surface water body. To legally discharge pollutants directly into a waterbody, a facility—municipal, industrial, commercial or government-owned—must obtain a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit from EPA or a state agency."
 Regulatory framework , NPDES Permit Program ,"The NPDES permit program sets limits on the amount of pollutants that can be discharged into a waterbody. Technology based effluent limits establish a minimum level of pollution controls for all point source discharges. If technology based limits are not sufficient to protect a particular water body, then water quality based effluent limits are developed for facilities discharging to that water body. PermitsIndividual states are authorized by the EPA to issue permits when they have demonstrated that their program is at least as stringent as the EPA's program."
 Regulatory framework , NPDES Permit Program ,"States perform the day-to-day issuance of permits and oversight of the program while the EPA provides review and guidance to the states. All NPDES permits must contain a ""specific, numeric, measurable set of limits on the amount of various pollutants that can appear in the wastewater discharged by the facility into the nation's waters"" as well as guidelines on how often monitoring should be performed and what ""sampling and analytic techniques should be used."" Types of permitsIndividual – A unique permit is issued for each discharger."
 Regulatory framework , NPDES Permit Program ,"General – A single permit that covers a large number of similar dischargers in a specific geographic area. Examples include the EPA Vessels General Permit and industrial stormwater general permits.Permitting processThe authorized permit issuing body receives and reviews the permit application. The technology-based and water quality-based effluent limits are developed and then compared to determine which is the more stringent, which is then used as the effluent limit for the permit. Monitoring requirements, special conditions, and standard conditions for each pollutant are developed and the permit is then issued and its requirements are implemented."
 Regulatory framework , NPDES Permit Program ,"Technology-based requirements: A minimum level of treatment based on available treatment technologies is required for discharged pollutants, however, a discharger may use any available treatment technologies to meet the limits. The effluent limits are derived from different standards for different discharges: Municipal discharges (POTW): National secondary treatment standards define limits of biological treatment standards based on biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and pH balance. Industrial and other non-municipal discharges: Limits for many industrial dischargers are based on national standards for issued for specific categories, such as chemical plants, paper mills, and electric power plants (see Effluent guidelines)."
 Regulatory framework , NPDES Permit Program ,"EPA issues these limitations based on the performance of pollution control and prevention technologies. For existing dischargers, this level of treatment is equivalent to ""Best Available Technology Economically Achievable"" (BAT) and for new discharges, the treatment level is ""New Source Performance Standards"" (NSPS). If there is no applicable national standard (effluent guideline regulation) for a particular facility, the NPDES permit agency develops requirements on a case-by-case basis. Water quality-based requirements: Should technology-based standards not be stringent enough, Water Quality Based Effluent Limits (WQBEL) are developed to ensure that water quality standards are attained."
 Regulatory framework , NPDES Permit Program ,WQBELs are based on ambient water quality standards.Permit componentsAll NPDES permits must contain the following five components: Cover page – indicates authorization for discharging and its locations Effluent limits – limits used to control discharges through technology-based or water quality-based standards Monitoring and reporting requirements – used to determine permit compliance Special conditions – can be used to supplement effluent limits Standard conditions – pre-established conditions that apply to all NPDES permitsPermit violationA permitee can be in violation of their permit when they discharge pollutants at a level higher than what is specified on their permit or discharge without a permit.
 Regulatory framework , NPDES Permit Program ,They can also be in violation if they fail to comply with the monitoring and enforcement portion of the permit.
 Regulatory framework , NPDES Permit Program ,"EnforcementSince the NPDES permit program is a self-monitoring system where permitees are required to carry out detailed monitoring requirements, the EPA promotes ""compliance assistance"" as an enforcement technique, which ""helps permittees come into, and remain, in compliance with their permit, rather than going immediately to enforcement actions."" The EPA and state NPDES agencies have can perform periodic inspections and the EPA gives individual states the authority to enforce NPDES permits although the EPA has the right to carry out enforcement should a state not do so."
 Regulatory framework , NPDES Permit Program ,"Enforcement actions for violations include: injunctions, fines for typical violations, imprisonment for criminal violations, or supplemental environmental projects (SEP). Citizens may also bring suits against violators but they must first provide the EPA and state NPDES permit agency with the opportunity to take action."
 Regulatory framework , Stormwater management permits ,"To address the nationwide problem of stormwater pollution, Congress broadened the CWA definition of ""point source"" in 1987 to include industrial stormwater discharges and municipal separate storm sewer systems (""MS4""). These facilities are required to obtain NPDES permits. This 1987 expansion was promulgated in two phases. The Phase I regulation, promulgated in 1990, required that all municipalities of 100,000 persons or more, industrial dischargers, and construction sites of 5 acres (20,000 m2) or more have NPDES permits for their stormwater discharges. Phase I permits were issued in much of the U.S. in 1991."
 Regulatory framework , Stormwater management permits ,"The Phase II rule required that all municipalities, construction sites of 1 acre (4,000 m2) or more, and other large property owners (such as school districts) have NPDES permits for their stormwater discharges. EPA published the Phase II regulation in 1999. About 855 Phase I MS4s and 6,695 Phase II MS4s are regulated by the permit system, as of 2018. The MS4s serve over 80% of the US population and provide drainage for 4% of the land area.Most construction sites are covered by general permits. Other industrial sites that only discharge stormwater are typically covered by general permits."
 Regulatory framework , Stormwater management permits ,"Industrial stormwater dischargers that are otherwise required to have individual permits (due to their process wastewater and/or cooling water discharges), typically have the stormwater management requirements added to their individual permits. In addition to implementing the NPDES requirements, many states and local governments have enacted their own stormwater management laws and ordinances, and some have published stormwater treatment design manuals. Some of these state and local requirements have expanded coverage beyond the federal requirements. For example, the State of Maryland requires erosion and sediment controls on construction sites of 5,000 sq ft (460 m2) or more."
 Regulatory framework , Stormwater management permits ,"It is not uncommon for state agencies to revise their requirements and impose them upon counties and cities; daily fines ranging as high as $25,000 can be imposed for failure to modify their local stormwater permitting for construction sites, for instance."
 Regulatory framework , Indirect dischargers ,"An indirect discharger is one that sends its wastewater into a city sewer system, which carries it to the municipal sewage treatment plant or publicly owned treatment works (POTW). At the POTW, harmful pollutants in domestic sewage, called conventional pollutants, are removed from the sewage and then the treated effluent is discharged into a surface water body. The removed solids constitute sewage sludge, which typically receive further treatment prior to final disposal on land. (See Sewage sludge treatment.) POTWs are not designed to treat toxic or nonconventional pollutants in industrial wastewater, although they may incidentally remove some pollutants."

 Regulatory framework , National Pretreatment Program ,"Discharges to a POTW are regulated either by the POTW itself, the state/tribe, or EPA."
 Regulatory framework , EPA water quality trading policy ,"The Clean Water Act has made great strides in reducing point source water pollution, but this effect is overshadowed by the fact that nonpoint source pollution, which is not subject to regulation under the Act, has correspondingly increased. One of the solutions to address this imbalance is point/nonpoint source trading of pollutants. EPA issued its Water Quality Trading Policy in 2003. At that time, many waters in the United States did not support their designated uses. Specifically, 40 percent of rivers, 45 percent of streams, and 50 percent of lakes that had been surveyed did not meet standards."

 Regulatory framework , EPA water quality trading policy ,"All water quality trading programs are subject to the requirements of the Clean Water Act.The Trading Policy outlines basic ground rules for trading by specifying viable pollutants, how to set baselines, and detailing the components of credible trading programs. It also stipulates that trades must occur within the same watershed. Water quality trading programs are subject to the stipulations of the Clean Water Act."
 Regulatory framework , Other laws that may affect some NPDES permits ,"Endangered Species Act: Federal agencies must consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to ensure that discharges from a project (e.g., a new or expanded industrial facility) will not endanger a threatened species or their habitat. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA): Only discharges that are subject to New Source Performance Standards (or new sources otherwise defined in the NPDES regulations) are subject to NEPA review prior to being issued a permit. National Historic Preservation Act: Prior to issuing a permit, EPA Regional Administrators must adopt measures that mitigate adverse effects on properties in the National Register of Historic Places."

 Problems/issues/concerns , Cost issues for monitoring ,"Monitoring of water bodies is the responsibility of authorized states, not the EPA. In 1997, EPA estimated that private and public point source control costs were $14 billion and $34 billion, respectively. The EPA has acknowledged that states have not adequately funded their monitoring programs, which has led to some uncertainty regarding the quality of most surface waters."
 Problems/issues/concerns , Self-monitoring and self-reporting ,"In many cases, the enforcement mechanisms of the Clean Water Act have created tension between regulators, regulated parties, and local citizens. Most NPDES permits require dischargers to monitor and report the contents of their discharges to the appropriate authorities. This requirement is potentially self-incriminating, forcing industries to provide information that may subject them to penalties and legal constraints. As a result, some dischargers go to great lengths to avoid penalties, including falsifying discharge monitoring reports and tampering with monitoring equipment. In United States v."
 Problems/issues/concerns , Self-monitoring and self-reporting ,"Hopkins, the court ruled on a case where the vice president for manufacturing at Spirol International Corporation was charged with three criminal violations for falsifying water samples sent to state regulatory agencies. Spirol diluted his samples, which contained high levels of zinc, with tap water on numerous occasions and frequently ordered his subordinates to reduce the zinc concentration in the water by running it through a coffee filter."
 Problems/issues/concerns , Tensions between state and federal government ,"Like other environmental laws, the Clean Water Act delegates many enforcement responsibilities to state agencies. While the burden of enforcement may be transferred to the states, federal agencies reserve the right to approve or reject state plans for dealing with water pollution. This relationship reduces the regulatory burden on federal agencies, but can lead to confusion and tension between the two regulators. Many of these tensions arise with regards to the commerce clause of the constitution. Until recently, the commerce clause has given the federal government considerable authority in regulating states' decisions about water use."
 Problems/issues/concerns , Tensions between state and federal government ,"In 2000, the United States Supreme Court ruled on Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. US Army Corps of Engineers. This ruling struck down the Corps' ability to prevent the construction of a disposal site for non-hazardous waste in Illinois based on power derived from the commerce clause. The Corps cited the Migratory Bird Rule when they initially denied the section 404 permit under the Clean Water Act. The migratory bird rule was meant to protect habitats used by migratory birds, which included the abandoned mining site that SWANCC had proposed to construct the waste disposal site."
 Problems/issues/concerns , Tensions between state and federal government ,"Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote: ""Congress passes the CWA for the state purpose of 'restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.' In doing so,, Congress chose to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution, to plan the development and use... of land and water resources..."". In reversing the Corps' decision to issue a permit, the court reversed a trend and placed a check on federal power over state land use and water rights."
 Problems/issues/concerns , Tensions between state and federal government ,"Tensions between federal and state agencies concerning interstate commerce and point source water pollution continue, and are a reality of the Clean Water Act."
 Problems/issues/concerns , Coeur Alaska v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council ,"In 2009, the Supreme Court ruled on Coeur Alaska, Inc. v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council. The case concerned the re-opening of a gold mine outside Juneau, Alaska that had been out of operation since 1928. Coeur Alaska planned to utilize froth flotation in order to extract gold, creating 4.5 million tons of tailings over the course of its lifetime. The mining company opted to dispose of the tailings in nearby Lower Slate Lake, requiring a permit to comply with the Clean Water Act."
 Problems/issues/concerns , Coeur Alaska v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council ,"The tailings would fundamentally change the physical and chemical characteristics of the lake, raising the lake bed by 50 feet and expanding the area from 23 to 60 acres. Coeur Alaska proposed to temporarily re-route nearby streams around Lower Slate Lake until they could purify the water and re-introduce the natural flow patterns. Tailings from froth flotation contain high concentrations of heavy metals, including aluminum, which have toxic effects of aquatic organisms. As a result, the disposal of these tailings into Lower Slate Lake is eligible for a section 402 permit for discharge of a pollutant from the EPA (NPDES permit)."
 Problems/issues/concerns , Coeur Alaska v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council ,"The nature of the tailings also justifies their categorization as a fill material, or a ""material [that] has the effect of… changing the bottom elevation"" of a water body. Consequently, Coeur Alaska was also eligible for a ""Dredge and Fill"" permit from the Army Corps of Engineers under CWA section 404. The company applied for this latter permit and received authorization from the Corps to dump the tailings into Lower Slate Lake."
 Problems/issues/concerns , Coeur Alaska v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council ,"The Southeast Alaska Conservation Council contended that disposal of the tailings is explicitly banned by section 306(e) of the Clean Water Act, and would therefore make Coeur Alaska ineligible for a NPDES permit. The Court ruled in favor of Coeur Alaska, explaining that if the Army Corps of Engineers has authority to issue a permit under section 404, the EPA does not have authority to issue a section 402 permit. They asserted that the law is ambiguous as to whether section 306 applies to fill materials and found no erroneous or unreasonable behavior by the Corps."
 Problems/issues/concerns , Coeur Alaska v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council ,"As a result, although the tailings would explicitly violate the Clean Water Act under section 402, the Corps may issue a dredge and fill permit. This decision has not resonated well with environmental groups, who are worried that the decision may allow companies to discharge massive amounts of hazardous pollutants by avoiding the NPDES permitting procedure. Of particular concern is the mountaintop mining industry, which has the capacity to fundamentally alter aquatic ecosystems by filling in water bodies with sediment and mining debris."
 Problems/issues/concerns , Coeur Alaska v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council ,This tension between various sections within the Clean Water Act is sure to receive considerable attention in future years.
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Definition ,"Water quality trading (WQT) is a market-based approach, implemented on a watershed-scale, used to improve or maintain water quality. It involves the voluntary exchange of pollution reduction credits from sources with low costs of pollution control to those with high costs of pollution control. WQT programs are still subject to the requirements of the Clean Water Act, but they can be used to reduce the overall cost of compliance. Usually, permitted point sources of water pollution, such as wastewater treatment plants, have high discharge treatment costs, whereas nonpoint sources of water pollution, such as agriculture, have low costs of pollution reduction."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Definition ,"Therefore, it is generally assumed that most trades would take place between point sources and nonpoint sources. However, point source-point source trades could also occur as well as pretreatment trades and intra-plant trades."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Background ,"Most of the water quality trading markets currently in operation are focused on the trading of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen. However, increasing interest has been shown in trading programs for sediment runoff, biological oxygen demand, and temperature. WQT programs can be used to preserve good water quality in unimpaired waters by counterbalancing new or increased pollutant discharges."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Background ,"In impaired waters, a WQT program can be used to improve water quality by reducing pollutant discharges in order to meet a specified water quality standard or total maximum daily load (TMDL).TMDLs apply to both point sources and nonpoint sources and they represent the primary impetus for WQT programs. Point sources of pollutants that require NPDES permits often have strict discharge limits based on a TMDL. WQT can allow these sources to obtain lower costs of compliance, while still achieving the overall desired pollution reduction. Several factors influence whether or not a TMDL-based water quality trading program will be successful."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Background ,"First, the market must be appropriately structured within the regulatory framework of the Clean Water Act. Second, the pollutant must be well-suited for trading. Third, implementation of a WQT market requires public input and voluntary participation. Finally, there must be adequate differences in pollution control costs and available opportunities for reduction."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Credits and trade ratios ,"In a WQT market, a unit of pollutant reduction is called a credit. A point source can generate credits by reducing its discharge below its most stringent effluent limitation and a nonpoint source can generate credits ""by installing best management practices (BMPs) beyond its baseline"". Before being able to purchase credits, source must first meet its technology-based effluent limit (TBEL). The credits can then be used to meet water quality-based effluent limits (WQBEL).In order to ensure that trades are effective and do not result in more pollution than would occur in their absence, trade ratios are used."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Credits and trade ratios ,"Trade ratios can have several components including: Location: Source location relevant to the downstream area of concern can be an important factor. Delivery: The distance between sources can play a role in determining whether permit requirements are met at the outfall. Uncertainty: Nonpoint source reductions can be difficult to quantify. Equivalency: Sources may be discharging different forms of the same pollutant. Retirement: Credits may be retired to achieve further water quality improvement.Permitted point sources can trade with other point sources or nonpoint sources. Trades can occur directly, or be brokered by third parties."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Credits and trade ratios ,"However, when dealing with nonpoint source reductions, a level of uncertainty does exist. In order to address this, monitoring should be conducted. Modeling can also be used as a supplement to monitoring. Uncertainty can also be mitigated by field testing BMPs and using conservative assumptions for BMP efficacy."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Benefits ,"There are many economic, environmental, and social benefits that can be gained by establishing a WQT market within a watershed. Economically, since WQT is a market-based policy instrument, substantial savings can be generated while still achieving a mandated water quality goal. According to The National Cost to Implement Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) Draft report, flexible approaches to improving water quality, such as WQT markets, could save $900 million per year when compared with the least flexible approach (3). In 2008, WQT programs were worth $11 million, but have the potential for rapid growth."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Benefits ,"Other economic benefits of WQT include a reduction in the overall costs of compliance, the ability for dischargers to take advantages of economies of scale and differences in treatment efficiencies, and the ability to maintain growth without further harming the environment.The environmental benefits of WQT programs are also numerous. First, habitats and ecosystems are protected and/or improved. Second, water quality objectives are able to be achieved in a timely manner. Third, there is incentive for innovation and creation of pollution prevention technologies. Finally, nonpoint sources are included in solving water quality problems."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Benefits ,Social benefits include dialog among watershed stakeholders and incentives for all dischargers to reduce their pollution.
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Factors influencing success ,"The success of a WQT market is determined by several factors including the pollutant of interest, physical characteristics of the affected watershed, control costs, trading mechanisms, and stakeholder participation and willingness. It is also important that the desired level of pollution reduction is not so great that all sources must reduce the maximum amount possible because this would eliminate surplus reductions to be used for credits."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Obstacles to implementation ,"The biggest obstacle to the widespread adoption of WQT markets is lack of supply and demand. In fact, studies of current water quality trading programs indicate that the typical problems associated with inhibition of water quality trading, such as high transaction costs, poor institutional infrastructure, and uncertain criteria, are being overcome. The main problem is that, under existing regulatory conditions, there are simply not enough willing buyers and sellers. Currently, most nonpoint sources of water pollution are unregulated or, assuming detection occurs, have relatively small consequences for violations. Consequently, nonpoint sources do not have incentive to participate in WQT."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Obstacles to implementation ,"For WQT markets to be successful, greater demand is needed for pollution credits. For this to happen, water quality standards need to be clear and enforceable."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Contrast to emissions trading ,"Given the success of the sulfur dioxide emission trading market that was established to combat acid rain, at first glance it seems that this level of success should be easily extended to water quality trading. However, the reason this has not occurred yet comes down to a fundamental difference between water pollution and air pollution, and the process of establishing their respective markets. Establishing an emissions market, in principle, has three steps: (1) set a cap on emissions, (2) allocate portions of the cap to individual firms, and (3) allow each firm to meet its allowance through emission reduction or trade."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Contrast to emissions trading ,"The difference with water pollution, however, is that the problems that cause local water quality issues differ from those that create regional air pollution problems. Discharges into water are difficult to measure and effects are dependent on a variety of other factors and vary with weather and location."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Overview ,"The border region (approximately 2,000 miles (3,200 km) long and 62 miles (100 km) wide) is predominantly arid and contains seven watersheds including the Rio Grande which forms part of the border. The watersheds provide numerous benefits for the 14 cities and over nine million people in the region. However, increasing population, the arid climatic conditions of the region, the nature of economic activities along the rivers, increased trade, and uncontrolled emissions into them have placed tremendous pressure on water resources and threatened natural ecosystems."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Overview ,A large proportion of the population lacks access to clean drinking water and sanitation triggering public health concerns.
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Policy issues ,"Point source water pollution is a source of concern along the US-Mexico border as pollutants from both countries are entering shared waterways due to agricultural runoff, industrial discharge, and untreated sewage. Various policy issues arise in attempting to deal with this and include: Some pollution originates from areas beyond the border region as pollution is carried into the region by the waterways. This makes it difficult to regulate as discharges are difficult to apportion and control. Pollution is caused by and affects both countries therefore requiring a joint response."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Policy issues ,The socio-economic differences between the two countries have implications for policy implementation and enforcement. Various interests are represented with strong influence from environmental and social groups. Multiple levels of government agencies are also involved.
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Policy responses ,"There have been several attempts to address environmental concerns in the border region in the past by both governments. Significant intervention, however, resulted from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) of 1994 between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico which renewed concerns over the environmental quality of the region due to increased trade in the region. The two governments therefore entered into the US-Mexico Border Environment Cooperation Agreement which created a number of institutions and programs. The Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC) and the North American Development Bank (NADB) were created to address border environmental-infrastructure issues and began operation in 2004."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Policy responses ,Distinct characteristics of these institutions and their approach are that they: are truly bi-national (have members from both countries) at all levels; emphasize a bottom-up approach with enhanced public participation; have a preference to assist disadvantaged communities; avoid regulatory or standard-driven approaches; emphasize economic and environmental sustainability. (As of 2018 the two organizations are in the process of merging into a single entity.) The US-Mexico Border Program was also created by the agreement and placed under the management of EPA (through its Region 6 and 9 offices) to correct the oversights of previous institutions and give guidance to cross-border environmental policy.
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Policy responses ,"The three institutions work together to identify, develop, finance and implement projects in the communities and certify them as ""environmentally sustainable"" subsequently funding them through a grant-making process. Communities, public, and private entities (sponsors) are invited to submit water and wastewater infrastructure projects. These projects are required to meet certain criteria to qualify for certification and funding. Among other requirements, they have to address an eligible environmental sector; must have a U.S.-side benefit; and have adequate planning, operations and maintenance, and pretreatment provisions."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Policy responses ,"One specific provision touching on point-source water pollution states that ""projects where the discharge is directly or indirectly to U.S. side waters, must target achievement of U.S. norms for ambient water quality in U.S. side waters, although infrastructure development may be phased over time. Any flow reductions that result from implementation of non-discharging alternatives must not threaten U.S. or shared ecosystems"". Projects receive significant input from the communities living in the region in determining their sustainability. After certification, the project then receives funding from the NADB."
 Other emerging regulatory approaches , Policy responses ,"As of 2018 NADB has certified 246 projects worth approximately three billion dollars.The border program has also facilitated direct provision of infrastructure by the federal and state governments such as the construction of wastewater treatment plants, sewer lines, and raw water storage lagoons. One such example is the construction of the Matamoros lift station which is the first phase in eliminating raw sewage discharges into the Rio Grande. Further, the program emphasizes the provision of environmental education and information to communities living in the region."

The tailings solution had a pH of 1.2 and a gross alpha particle activity of 128 nanocuries (4.7 kBq) per liter. In addition to radioactive uranium, thorium, radium and polonium, it also contained various other metals, including cadmium, aluminium, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, sodium, vanadium, zinc, iron, and lead, and also high concentrations of sulfates."
 Dam failure ,,"The contaminated water from the Church Rock spill traveled 80 miles (130 km) downstream, through Gallup, New Mexico, and reached as far as Navajo County, Arizona. The flood backed up sewers, affected nearby aquifers, and left stagnating, contaminated pools on the riverside.As the highly acidic spill traveled downstream, alkaline soils and clays neutralized the acid and adsorbed many of the contaminants. The contaminated sediments were gradually dispersed by the river and diluted by ""clean"" sediment. In parts of the river system with higher concentrations of contaminants, yellow salt crystals precipitated onto the arroyo bed."
 Dam failure ,,"These salts, containing metals and radionuclides, were washed away during subsequent rainstorms. Approximately one month after the spill, the Puerco River had regained normal levels of salinity, acidity, and radioactivity at low flow levels, with contaminants being detectable only after heavy rains. The EPA reported no long-term effects of the spill, but noted that contaminant levels from uranium mine effluents and natural sources were ""environmentally significant""."
 Dam failure , Response ,"At 6:00 am, a United Nuclear Corporation employee noticed the breach and suspended further discharge of tailings solution to the holding pond. By 8:00, a temporary dike had stopped the flow of residual tailings solution.Several days after the spill, the Indian Health Service and the Environmental Improvement Division of New Mexico warned local residents over the radio and with signs written only in English not to drink from, water livestock at, or enter the Puerco River. Many Navajo people in the area speak only Diné, an Athabaskan language spoken by 150,000 people on the Navajo Nation."
 Dam failure , Response ,"The states of Arizona and New Mexico failed to make their residents immediately aware of the dangers of radiation. United Nuclear Corporation employees were dispatched to warn Navajo-speaking residents downstream in accordance with a state contingency plan, but not until a few days after the spill."
 Dam failure , Response ,"The Navajo Nation asked the governor of New Mexico, Bruce King, to request disaster assistance from the US government and have the site declared a disaster area, but he refused, an action that limited disaster relief assistance to the Navajo Nation.Although the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Division said the spill's ""short-term and long-term impacts on people and the environment were quite limited"", ponds of uranium-contaminated water lined the Puerco River and seeped into wells. United Nuclear denied claims that the spill caused livestock deaths, even though the Navajo economy, which was dependent on the sale of mutton was harmed."
 Dam failure , Response ,"The company said in a statement issued by an attorney, ""We just don't know of any substance to those claims. Some people aren't going to be satisfied no matter how thoroughly you show it."" Navajo Tribal Council's vice president Frank Paul said of the worst spill in US history, ""Somehow, United Nuclear Corporation was permitted to locate a tailings pond and a dam on an unstable geologic formation. Somehow, UNC was allowed to design an unsafe tailings dam not in conformance to its own design criteria."
 Dam failure , Response ,"Somehow, UNC was permitted to inadequately deal with warning cracks that had appeared over two years prior to the date the dam failed. Somehow, UNC was permitted to continue a temporary dam for six months beyond its design life. Somehow, UNC was permitted to have a tailings dam without either an adequate contingency plan or sufficient men and material in place to deal with a spill."
 Dam failure , Response ,"Somehow, UNC was permitted to deal with the spill by doing almost nothing.""Under the ""agreement state"" legislative framework of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission left New Mexico to handle the dam failure until October 12, 1979, when it was notified that the state would permit the uranium mill to resume operation that week. The NRC then suspended United Nuclear's operating license until it could be determined that the embankment was stable. After fewer than four months of downtime following the dam failure, the mill resumed operations on November 2, 1979."
 Dam failure , Response ,"This resumption further contaminated the groundwater and resulted in the mill site's placement on the EPA's National Priorities List in 1983. United Nuclear made a $525,000 out-of-court settlement with the Navajo Nation a year after the spill.The accident released more radioactivity than the Three Mile Island accident. The spill has been called ""the largest radioactive accident in U.S. history,"" but the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said that this is ""an overstatement,"" and that ""there have been a number of other events that have been more significant in terms of radiological impact."
 Dam failure , Response ,"The event was more significant from an environmental perspective than from a human one."" Nevertheless, the incident remains the ""largest single release"" of radioactive materials into the environment in US history as of October 2020. The dam formed the southern wall of one of the mill's three holding ponds, which were used to evaporate tailings solution until the remaining solid waste could be buried. From 1967 to 1982, the mill produced an average of 4,000 short tons (3,600 t) of tailings every day, for a total of 3.5 million short tons (3.2 Mt)."
 Dam failure , Response ,"The 35-foot (11 m) high embankment was constructed on a deposit of collapsible clayey, silty sand, one hundred feet (30 m) deep. United Nuclear used a new design, recommended by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that used earth rather than tailings themselves as building material. The holding pond was not lined, a violation of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978."
 Dam failure , Response ,"This allowed tailings solution to seep into the ground, weakening the foundation of the dam and contaminating the groundwater.Horizontal and vertical cracks formed along the southern part of the embankment, allowing the acidic tailings solution to penetrate and weaken the embankment. A sand beach was constructed to protect the face of the embankment from the tailings solution, but it was not properly maintained. The liquid in the holding pond eventually rose two feet (0.61 m) higher than the dam's designed limit, past the point where the sand beach could protect the dam."
 Dam failure , Response ,"The United States Army Corps of Engineers concluded in its report to Governor Bruce King of New Mexico that the principal cause of failure was differential settlement of the foundation beneath the dam wall, and the report commissioned by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission corroborated this conclusion. Critical variations in tailings pond operation practice from approved procedures contributed further to the dam failure. United Nuclear's Chief Operating Officer, J."
 Dam failure , Response ,"David Hann, blamed the failure of dam on the pointed shape of the bedrock beneath the embankment, which he said acted as a fulcrum and weakened the dam.In December 1977, independent consultants spotted cracks in the dam wall. Three months later, United Nuclear sealed the cracks with bentonite and kerosene slurry but took little or no other action, despite the consultant's urging for regular inspections of the dam. Further cracking was noted in October 1978. Neither the facility owner nor the State Engineer were formally notified of the cracks, though Arizona representative Morris K."
 Dam failure , Response ,"Udall testified before Congress that at least three federal and state agencies had ""ample opportunity"" to predict that the dam's failure was likely. At the same Congressional hearing, the United States Army Corps of Engineers testified that had the dam been built according to legal specifications, the failure would not have occurred. Shortly after the breach, below the dam radioactivity levels of river water were 7000 times that of the allowable level of drinking water."
 Dam failure , Response ,"United Nuclear initially claimed that only one curie of radioactivity had been released in the spill, but that figure was later revised upward by the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Division. In all, 46 curies (1.7 TBq) of radioactivity were released.Prior to the spill, local residents used the riverside for recreation and herb-gathering, and children often waded in the Puerco River. Residents who waded in the river after the spill went to the hospital complaining of burning feet and were misdiagnosed with heat stroke."
 Dam failure , Response ,"Burns acquired by some of those who came into contact with the contaminated water developed serious infections and required amputations. Herds of sheep and cattle died after drinking the contaminated water, and children played in pools of contaminated water. The spill contaminated shallow aquifers near the river that residents drank and used to water livestock. 1,700 people lost access to clean water after the spill. United Nuclear Corporation distributed 600 gallon-jugs of clean water, but the affected area required more than 30,000 US gallons (110,000 L; 25,000 imp gal) of water daily."
 Dam failure , Response ,"The three community wells serving Church Rock had already been closed, one because of high radium levels and the other two for high levels of iron and bacteria."

 Dam failure , Response ,"said that the wells ""are not expected to show any contamination, if at all, for several years."" The Navajo Nation spent $100,000 on clean water, and in 1981, the New Mexico and federal governments stopped providing water, which they had delivered by truck since the spill.An epidemiological study conducted by the NMEID in 1989 concluded that ""the health risk to the public from eating exposed cattle is minimal, unless large amounts of this tissue, especially liver and kidney, are ingested."" An Indian Health Service study found significantly higher levels of radionuclides in Church Rock cattle compared to livestock from non-mining areas."
 Dam failure , Response ,"The study's authors advised that contamination would not pose a risk as long as residents did not depend on livestock for food over long periods of time, but local Navajos did. A few Navajo children were sent to Los Alamos to be checked for radiation exposure, but no long-term monitoring was undertaken, prompting a local writer to comment that the IHS spent more effort studying livestock than the people affected. No ongoing epidemiological studies have been done at Church Rock."
 Dam failure , Response ,"Studies have shown since the 1950s that the Navajo have had significantly higher rates for some cancers than the national average, associated with contamination from the uranium mines and the exposure of workers to radiation. United Nuclear dispatched small crews with shovels and 55-US-gallon (210 L; 46 imp gal) drums to begin cleanup, but expanded the workforce after complaints from local residents and pressure from the state."
 Dam failure , Response ,"The crews removed three inches (76 mm) of sediment from the river bed, retrieving about 3,500 barrels (560 m3) of waste materials over the course of three months, but this amount was estimated as only 1% of the solid waste spilled. Groundwater remained contaminated by the spilled tailings solution, and rain transported leftover pollutants downstream into Arizona. New Mexico ordered United Nuclear to monitor pools left behind by the spill along the Puerco River, but United Nuclear measured only uranium levels, ignoring the presence of 230Th and 226Ra."
 Dam failure , Response ,"The pools contained high levels of sulfuric acid and remained for more than a month after the spill, despite cleanup efforts by the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Division. The NMEID ordered United Nuclear to control tailings seepage from the mill in 1979, and the company implemented a limited seepage collective program in 1981.The Navajo Nation appealed to the governor to request that the president declare the site a federal disaster area, but he refused, reducing the aid available to local residents."
 Dam failure , Response ,"United Nuclear continued operation of the uranium mill until 1982, when it closed because of the declining uranium market.United Nuclear neutralized the acidity of the tailings with ammonia and lime from 1979 to 1982. In 1983, the site was entered on the National Priorities List of the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund investigations and cleanup efforts, as radionuclides and chemical constituents were found to be contaminating local groundwater."
 Dam failure , Response ,"The EPA conducted a remedial investigation from 1984 to 1987, and in the NRC approved United Nuclear's closure and reclamation plan in 1988.In 1994 the EPA extended its efforts with a study of all known uranium mines on the Navajo Nation. The EPA and United Nuclear removed 175,500 cubic feet (4,970 m3) of radium-contaminated soil surrounding five buildings, some residential, in 2007. The soil was moved to an off-site disposal facility."
 Dam failure , Response ,"In 2003 the Churchrock Chapter of the Navajo Nation began the Church Rock Uranium Monitoring Project to assess environmental impacts of abandoned uranium mines, and build capacity to conduct community-based research with policy implications. Its May 2007 report found radiation many times higher than background levels remaining in the area, from both natural and mining sources.In 2008, the US Congress authorized a five-year plan for cleanup of contaminated uranium sites on the Navajo reservation.

 History ,,"In late 2013, the US Geological Survey and the Environmental Protection Agency studied samples from untreated and treated water from the United States' utilities, where researchers had found traces of chemicals in the water of areas including Lawrence County and Morgan County, Alabama. Although there is minimal information on the long-term effects of the contaminated water, researchers discovered that a fluorinated compound called Perfluorooctanoic acid was in the water sample."
 History ,,"This chemical compound has been linked to many other health problems, such as thyroid disease, kidney cancer, and pregnancy-induced hypertension.Many Alabama residents have been suffering from contaminated water that can cause cancer, congenital disabilities for women of childbearing age, and developmental problems for children. EPA health advisories released on May 19, 2016 prompted government officials to recommend that residents in both Lawrence County and Morgan County avoid drinking the water. After testing the citizens' blood concentration level, the EPA revealed that Lawrence and Morgan Counties had water that was contaminated with water pollutants introduced into the rivers and drinking system."
 History ,,"The residents have been advised not to use tap water because scientists have found traces of Perfluorooctanoic acid(PFOA) and Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid(PFOS) in the water source. The two primary pollutants, PFOS and PFOA, are known to be toxic substances that have been linked to causing certain types of cancers and other health symptoms. Companies in the area, such as 3M, Daikin, and its subsidiary Dyneon LLC, have been identified as the likely source of the introduction of pollutants in the water system."
 History ,,"There has been much controversy between government officials of varying levels as some question whether or not the alleged water pollution exists or if the numbers are not a concern. As a result, EPA advised the citizens in the counties to refrain from ingesting the water until further studies are done regarding the issue.On August 6, 2016, the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water Authority released a statement saying that new tests of the water returned a value of 14 parts per trillion, which is below the EPA health advisory level."
 History ,,"However, officials of the water authority are still slightly concerned and continue to push for an activated carbon filter."
 Health impacts of PFOA and PFOS , Effects of PFOA ,"Perfluorooctanic acid (PFOA) is commonly used as a degradation product with other perfluorinated compounds. PFOA is also used in the production of Teflon, also known as polytetrafluoroethylene, which is often used as a non-stick surface of many cooking items. The chemical often occurs in water systems in industrialized countries. Based on various animal data analysis, the compound has toxic effects on the immune system, the endocrine systems, and may also cause tumors."
 Health impacts of PFOA and PFOS , Effects of PFOA ,"Major manufacturers tried to limit the use of Perfluorooctanoic acid since it's been revealed that water resources have been contaminated with this compound, including industrial sites, municipal waste sites, and industrial wastes. Children exposed to this chemical are at an increased risk of developing thyroid diseases. When the thyroid gland is affected, it can impact other body parts within the human body which can lead to other health symptoms such as growth development. Although the chemical is not visible, the chemical can enter a body's bloodstream if the person consumes the polluted water."
 Health impacts of PFOA and PFOS , Effects of PFOA ,"Also, humans as well as other living species that consume the contaminated water are at a higher risk of contracting various health problems. The chemical is used in a variety of consumer products such as clothing, food packages, and furniture. According to scientific studies, the leading cause for the introduction of the chemicals in various drinking water sources is due to contamination from nearby industrial plants."
 Health impacts of PFOA and PFOS , Effects of PFOS ,"Perfluorooctane Sulfonate acid (PFOS) is a known global pollutant that is considered toxic to the environment. Although the contaminant is existent in the environment, there is limited information on the effect that Perfluorooctane Sulfonate acid (PFOS) has on the human body. In relations, scientists are still not certain about the long-term health effects that Perfluorooctane Sulfonate acid (PFOS) has on water and food."
 Health impacts of PFOA and PFOS , Effects of PFOS ,"According to epidemiological studies, exposure to the substance will lead to adverse effects including defects during fetal development, tissue damage, and thyroid damage.Communities that are located nearby these factory plants have likely consumed the contaminated water, exposing residents to these harmful compounds. To reduce the exposure of the chemicals, public health officials suggest that water systems be carefully monitored and managed with a filtered water system. Further studies need to be done to understand the relationship between the two chemicals and the general population."
 Health impacts of PFOA and PFOS , Effects of PFOS ,"In order to know the long-term effects of Perfluorooctanoic acid and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate acid has on the human body, researchers must examine the origins of each water source and the nearby communities. On March 19, 2016, the EPA posted health advisories about the two chemicals PFOA and PFOS. According to the new health advisories, a combined level of 70 parts per trillion for both PFOA and PFOS is said to be hazardous and has the potential to impact health negatively. This new value is a relatively significant increase from previous levels that were believed to be safe."
 Health impacts of PFOA and PFOS , Effects of PFOS ,"In 2009, a level of 0.04 parts per billion of PFOA and PFOS was considered to be a potential hazard for drinking water by the EPA. In 2012, the EPA passed the Third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 3). The UCMR was initiated as a result of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as changes in 1996 required the EPA to provide a list of unregulated water contaminants that should begin to be monitored."
 Health impacts of PFOA and PFOS , Effects of PFOS ,"PFOA and PFOS were both listed in the UCMR 3, making public water systems in the United States to have to begin testing the chemical levels of PFOA and PFOS along with the other chemicals listed. While the new health advisories have been released by the EPA in 2016, there are currently no enforceable standards regarding national regulations."
 Health impacts of PFOA and PFOS , Effects of PFOS ,"As stated by the EPA, health advisories are mainly intended to give information about the chemicals in question and allow further research to take place before more action is taken.In February 2017, the Trump administration reportedly began looking into shutting down the Office of Enforcement & Compliance Assurance (OECA), which is a division of the EPA that works to enforce multiple federal laws including the Safe Drinking Water Act."
 Health impacts of PFOA and PFOS , Effects of PFOS ,"On March 8, 2017, New York senators drafted new legislation that would require the EPA to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act and have it set more strict levels for compounds such as PFOA and PFOS. The senators and its supporters hope that it will pass through the Senate and that the Trump Administration will approve of it. In the House of Representatives, several legislators are also pushing for the military to be responsible for cleaning up some PFOA and PFOS pollution from various military locations across the nation."
 Health impacts of PFOA and PFOS , Effects of PFOS ,"Despite the proposed budget cuts to the EPA by the Trump administration, PFOA and PFOS research is still being done by the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program and the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program, programs funded by the Department of Defense. The toxic substances had contaminated the drinking water of nearby counties. After collecting various blood samples from Morgan County and Lawrence County, the state of Alabama was under investigation for water contamination. Although the levels of PFOA and PFOS were found in low concentrations, warnings were released indicating that prolonged exposure to these pollutants can cause serious health problems."
 Health impacts of PFOA and PFOS , Effects of PFOS ,"In order to remove these pollutants from drinking water, the EPA recommends that unconventional methods such as Activated carbon filtering or high-pressure membrane filtering must be used, demonstrating the extra precautions residents must take. The investigation explained how individuals went through a similar problem with water contamination in the past, yet there were still no signs of long-term health effects regarding the contaminated water. The recommendation of installing an activated carbon filter or a high pressure membrane filter as a method to get rid of the PFOA/PFOS pollution in the water are not commonly used methods to treat water."
 Health impacts of PFOA and PFOS , Effects of PFOS ,"A proposed $4 million activated carbon filtration system by the water authority would be a temporary solution until a larger reverse osmosis treatment plant could be built. In addition, citizens are also concern over the cost and the lack of access to resources and the proposed solution. Due to differing responses from government officials and water authority officials and lack of expertise regarding PFOA/PFOS pollution, there is confusion among citizens regarding what is the best course of action."
 Impacts on residents , Lawrence County ,"Lawrence County, Alabama, a county in North Alabama was affected by the release of PFOA and PFOS into their main source of water. Although the Water and Sewer Authority affected belongs to East Lawrence and West Morgan counties, the West Lawrence Water Co-op also uses water from the authority's system. Because of this, all of Lawrence county has been affected by the contamination in drinking water. There is a diverse background of those affected by the water contamination."
 Impacts on residents , Lawrence County ,"The percentage of people whose race was white alone in Alabama in 2015 was 77.1%, whereas the percentage in Lawrence County, Alabama was 78.2%. Lawrence County was 11.2% Black or African-American alone, 5.8% Native American, 2.2% Hispanic or Latino alone, and 0.2% Asian alone in 2015. The entire state of Alabama was 13.3% Black or African American alone, 1.2% Native American, 17.6% Hispanic or Latino alone, and 5.6% Asian alone. The median income for Lawrence County in 2015 was $40,003, and the persons in poverty were 18.7%."
 Impacts on residents , Lawrence County ,"The median income of Alabama in 2015 was $53, 889, and the person in poverty were 13.5%."
 Impacts on residents , Morgan County ,"Morgan County, Alabama, is another Northern Alabama County affected by PFOA and PFOS pollution in the drinking water. The West Morgan-East Lawrence Water Authority, which services parts of both Morgan and Lawrence counties, was one of the main water facilities cited as potentially having a water pollution issue. The manufacturing company 3M is believed to have contributed to the pollution as a result of activity at a Decatur, a city in Morgan County, manufacturing plant. According to 2015 data, the annual income for Morgan households was $45,751 compared to $53,889 for the state of Alabama."
 Impacts on residents , Morgan County ,"In Morgan, 16.1% of individuals are below the poverty level compared to 13.5% of individuals in the state."
 Impacts on residents , Environmental groups ,"Since the EPA health advisory, two environmental groups have been working with citizens of both Lawrence and Morgan to help resolve the pollution issue. The group Tennessee Riverkeeper filed a lawsuit on February 15, 2017, against the company 3M, seeking to make 3M among other groups responsible for the clean-up and resolution of the PFOA and PFOS pollution. The group New York Environmental Law & Justice Project is currently working with Lawrence and Morgan community groups to raise public knowledge of the issue and work towards a resolution, potentially through legal action."
 Impacts on residents , Environmental groups ,"If water systems are not properly monitored, PFOA and PFOS from nearby industrial sites that use or manufacture the chemicals can spread into the water. Due to the state's budget cut, the amount of funding has declined over the years, and thus there is not enough financial support to enable strict water inspections in the area. The water division stated their intent to try running an environmental program that will enforce better water plans."
 Impacts on residents , Environmental groups ,"In the meantime, the West Morgan East Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority is currently working on a new and improved filtration system, which is set to be finished in 2019.According to the Alabama state Governor Robert Bentley, the water issues that predominated in Lawrence and Morgan Counties were nothing to worry about. Companies had warned neighboring communities their history of releasing chemicals into the local water system, and the EPA released a statement warning people about the tested, unsafe level of pollutants in the water. Despite these warnings, Governor Robert Bentley still refused to acknowledge the problem."
 Impacts on residents , Environmental groups ,"However, some of the residents in these counties are scared and will continue to avoid the water since there could very well be a health risk involved. The contamination of the water has taken an emotional toll on some of the residents in the area, explaining how companies that moved into the area have been ruining their neighborhood. There are inconsistent responses from both the government and the water department."
 Impacts on residents , Environmental groups ,"The general manager of the water department, Don Sims, released a statement regarding the dangers of the water and warned citizens to avoid drinking it; however, Sims was criticized by the EPA and government officials for releasing the statement. As a result of miscommunication and a lack of definitive answers from officials, citizens of both Lawrence and Morgan are unsure of what the best solution to this pollution issue."
 Companies' responses , 3M water contamination lawsuit ,"The 3M manufacturing company, located in Decatur, was shown to be the major producer of both PFOS and PFOA. 3M has responded to the water contamination as harmless to the human body since those materials are commonly found in people. Although many individuals have filed complaints regarding the issue, 3M stated how: its own employees who worked in close contact with the substances have not shown increased risk of health problems and the presence of these substances in the environment is not necessarily harmful."
 Companies' responses , 3M water contamination lawsuit ,"In 2002, 3M had voluntarily phased out production of the chemicals due to the various lawsuit from other companies. Also, the EPA had suggested an alternative plan for the water contamination thus they suggest the state to replace the water system with a carbon filter within the water system. Following the new EPA health advisory from March 2016, the West Morgan East Lawrence Water Authority filed a lawsuit against 3M, arguing that the company is at fault for the pollution and potential health risks."
 Companies' responses , 3M water contamination lawsuit ,"Representatives of 3M believe that the company has done its part to work with agencies such as the EPA to handle the situation and thus think the suit is unwarranted.Along with 3M Co, Daikin and its subsidiary Dyneon LLC got sued for its water contamination in the Tennessee River. According to the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority, Daikin settled its portion of the lawsuit by paying $5 million involving with the water contamination containing PFOA and PFOS."
 Companies' responses , 3M water contamination lawsuit ,"The settlement consisted of $3.9 million going into the water's authority's temporary filtration system and $450,000 will be divided amongst the water systems in the state. In relations to the settlement, Daikin admitted that they did no wrong in the disposal of the chemicals and customers are reimbursed for their water bills during the ""do-not-drink warning"" period. Although the lawsuit has been ongoing for a while, the EPA issued a health advisory on May 19, 2016, to advised women of childbearing age to not use the drinking water."
 Related incidents ," Decatur, Alabama ","The high levels of PFOA and PFOS detected in 2016 was not the first incident of PFOA and PFOS pollution in the area. In 2007, the EPA decided to test the water in Decatur, Alabama, a part of Morgan County, due to industrial activity linked to the production of PFOA and PFOS of the companies 3M, Daikin America, and Toray Carbon Fibers America. The levels of PFOS and PFOA in the West Morgan-East Lawrence water system was determined to be below the current EPA acceptable levels (which were 0.4 parts per billion for PFOA and 0.2 parts per billion for PFOS)."
 Related incidents ," Decatur, Alabama ","Despite the tests showing the water was safe, blood tests revealed that residents in Decatur had slightly elevated blood serum levels of PFOA and PFOS, which is something the EPA wanted to monitor."
 Related incidents ," Parkersburg, West Virginia ","Parkersburg is on average a low-income community, with a median household income of $31,876 compared to $41,751 for the state of West Virginia. Parkersburg is also more impoverished compared to the state, with 24.3% of Parkersburg residents being below the poverty line compared to 18.0% for the state. In 2004, blood tests revealed higher than average concentrations of PFOA in blood serum in residents of Parkersburg, West Virginia. A DuPont Teflon producing plant operated near Parkersburg, and that plant has been identified as the likely source."
 Related incidents ," Parkersburg, West Virginia ","It was discovered that the DuPont plant had contaminated the local water supply with perfluorooctanoic (PFOA) acid thus residents in the area are advised to drink filtered water for the time being. For decades, studies have suggested that PFOA has been linked to many drinking water supplies and other fluorochemical-containing consumer products which can cause health problems."
 Related incidents ," Hoosick Falls, New York ","Hoosick Falls is a low-income community based on census data, with the median household income being $52,045 and that of the state of New York being $59,269. That being said, Hoosick Falls has a lower percentage of individuals that live below the poverty level compared to the state as a whole, with 10.9% of Hoosick Falls residents being in poverty and 15.7% of the state's residents. Hoosick Falls is a town located in New York where half of the population was seen to be exposed to water contamination."
 Related incidents ," Hoosick Falls, New York ","In January 2016, the EPA recommended that residents of Hoosick Falls use bottled water after finding traces of PFOA in the water supplies. The pollution was discovered in both public and private water supplies, and it is believed that facilities of the companies Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics and Honeywell International are the sources. The two companies were held responsible for the exposure of PFOA, thus they offered a settlement of over $1 million to cover the cost of the water contamination."
 Related incidents ," Hoosick Falls, New York ","While the settlement is still ongoing, a municipal activated-carbon filtration system has been installed and can be used by owners of private wells, but government officials still call upon the companies to pay for cleaning up the pollution and provided Hoosick Falls residents with clean drinking water."
 Related incidents ," North Bennington, Vermont ","With a median household income of $47,228 compared to $55,176 for the state, North Bennington is considered a low-income community of Vermont. A higher percentage of North Bennington residents are in poverty when compared to the state of Vermont as a whole, as 16.9% of North Bennington residents live below the poverty line compared to 11.5% of the state. Following the discovery of PFOA pollution in nearby Hoosick Falls, New York, the village of North Bennington, Vermont, found varying levels of PFOA contamination in the water supply and multiple private wells."
 Related incidents ," North Bennington, Vermont ","Facilities of the company Chemfab have been identified as the likely sources, and the Vermont Department of Health has offered blood tests for North Bennington residents since the levels of PFOA were higher than the department's health advisory level of 20 parts per trillion. The state and multiple agencies are continuing to look into the matter and determine the best course of action for the residents living in these communities."
 Related incidents , New Jersey public water systems ,"In 2006, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection conducted a study to see if there were PFOA and PFOS contamination in the state's public water systems. The researchers chose to only include water systems that were near facilities that either produced or used PFOA and PFOS. Of the 23 systems tested, 65% contained PFOA and 30% contained PFOS.

 Regulatory programs ,,"In the United States, the ""Clean Air Act"" typically refers to the codified statute at 42 U.S.C. ch. 85. That statute is the product of multiple acts of Congress, one of which—the 1963 act—was actually titled the Clean Air Act, and another of which—the 1970 act—is most often referred to as such. In the U.S. Code, the statute itself is divided into subchapters, and the section numbers are not clearly related to the subchapters."
 Regulatory programs ,,"However, in the bills that created the law, the major divisions are called ""Titles"", and the law's sections are numbered according to the title (e.g., Title II begins with Section 201). In practice, EPA, courts, and attorneys often use the latter numbering scheme. Although many parts of the statute are quite detailed, others set out only the general outlines of the law's regulatory programs, and leave many key terms undefined. Responsible agencies, primarily EPA, have therefore developed administrative regulations to carry out Congress's instructions. EPA's proposed and final regulations are published in the Federal Register, often with lengthy background histories."
 Regulatory programs ,,"The existing CAA regulations are codified at 40 C.F.R. Subchapter C, Parts 50–98. These Parts more often correspond to the Clean Air Act's major regulatory programs. Today, the following are major regulatory programs under the Clean Air Act."
 Regulatory programs , National Ambient Air Quality Standards ,"The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) govern how much ground-level ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), lead (Pb), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are allowed in the outdoor air. The NAAQS set the acceptable levels of certain air pollutants in the ambient air in the United States. Prior to 1965, there was no national program for developing ambient air quality standards, and prior to 1970 the federal government did not have primary responsibility for developing them."
 Regulatory programs , National Ambient Air Quality Standards ,"The 1970 CAA amendments required EPA to determine which air pollutants posed the greatest threat to public health and welfare and promulgate NAAQS and air quality criteria for them. The health-based standards were called ""primary"" NAAQS, while standards set to protect public welfare other than health (e.g., agricultural values) were called ""secondary"" NAAQS. In 1971, EPA promulgated regulations for sulfur oxides, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, photochemical oxidants, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen dioxide (36 FR 22384)."
 Regulatory programs , National Ambient Air Quality Standards ,"Initially, EPA did not list lead as a criteria pollutant, controlling it through mobile source authorities, but it was required to do so after successful litigation by Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in 1976 (43 FR 46258). The 1977 CAA Amendments created a process for regular review of the NAAQS list, and created a permanent independent scientific review committee to provide technical input on the NAAQS to EPA. EPA added regulations for PM2.5 in 1997 (62 FR 38652), and updates the NAAQS from time to time based on emerging environmental and health science."
 Regulatory programs , National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ,"The National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) govern how much of 187 toxic air pollutants are allowed to be emitted from industrial facilities and other sources. Under the CAA, hazardous air pollutants (HAPs, or air toxics) are air pollutants other than those for which NAAQS exist, which threaten human health and welfare. The NESHAPs are the standards used for controlling, reducing, and eliminating HAPs emissions from stationary sources such as industrial facilities. The 1970 CAA required EPA to develop a list of HAPs, and then develop national emissions standards for each of them. The original NESHAPs were health-based standards."
 Regulatory programs , National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ,"The 1990 CAA Amendments (Pub. L. 101–549 Title III) codified EPA's list, and required creation of technology-based standards according to ""maximum achievable control technology"" (MACT). Over the years, EPA has issued dozens of NESHAP regulations, which have developed NESHAPs by pollutant, by industry source category, and by industrial process. There are also NESHAPs for mobile sources (transportation), although these are primarily handled under the mobile source authorities."
 Regulatory programs , National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ,"The 1990 amendments (adding CAA § 112(d-f)) also created a process by which EPA was required to review and update its NESHAPs every eight years, and identify any risks remaining after application of MACT, and develop additional rules necessary to protect public health."
 Regulatory programs , New Source Performance Standards ,"The New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) are rules for the equipment required to be installed in new and modified industrial facilities, and the rules for determining whether a facility is ""new"". The 1970 CAA required EPA to develop standards for newly constructed and modified stationary sources (industrial facilities) using the ""best system of emission reduction which (taking into account the cost of achieving such reduction) the [EPA] determines has been adequately demonstrated."" EPA issued its first NSPS regulation the next year, covering steam generators, incinerators, Portland cement plants, and nitric and sulfuric acid plants (36 FR 24876)."
 Regulatory programs , New Source Performance Standards ,"Since then, EPA has issued dozens of NSPS regulations, primarily by source category. The requirements promote industrywide adoption of available pollution control technologies. However, because these standards apply only to new and modified sources, they promote extending the lifetimes of pre-existing facilities. In the 1977 CAA Amendments, Congress required EPA to conduct a ""new source review"" process (40 CFR 52, subpart I) to determine whether maintenance and other activities rises to the level of modification requiring application of NSPS."
 Regulatory programs , Acid Rain Program ,"The Acid Rain Program (ARP) is an emissions trading program for power plants to control the pollutants that cause acid rain. The 1990 CAA Amendments created a new title to address the issue of acid rain, and particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from electric power plants powered by fossil fuels, and other industrial sources. The Acid Rain Program was the first emissions trading program in the United States, setting a cap on total emissions that was reduced over time by way of traded emissions credits, rather than direct controls on emissions."
 Regulatory programs , Acid Rain Program ,The program evolved in two stages: the first stage required more than 100 electric generating facilities larger than 100 megawatts to meet a 3.5 million ton SO2 emission reduction by January 1995. The second stage gave facilities larger than 75 megawatts a January 2000 deadline. The program has achieved all of its statutory goals.
 Regulatory programs , Ozone layer protection ,"The CAA ozone program is a technology transition program intended to phase out the use of chemicals that harm the ozone layer. Consistent with the US commitments in the Montreal Protocol, CAA Title VI, added by the 1990 CAA Amendments, mandated regulations regarding the use and production of chemicals that harm Earth's stratospheric ozone layer."
 Regulatory programs , Ozone layer protection ,"Under Title VI, EPA runs programs to phase out ozone-destroying substances, track their import and export, determine exemptions for their continued use, and define practices for destroying them, maintaining and servicing equipment that uses them, identifying new alternatives to those still in use, and licensing technicians to use such chemicals."
 Regulatory programs , Mobile source programs ,"Rules for pollutants emitted from internal combustion engines in vehicles. Since 1965, Congress has mandated increasingly stringent controls on vehicle engine technology and reductions in tailpipe emissions. Today, the law requires EPA to establish and regularly update regulations for pollutants that may threaten public health, from a wide variety of classes of motor vehicles, that incorporate technology to achieve the ""greatest degree of emission reduction achievable"", factoring in availability, cost, energy, and safety (42 U.S.C. § 7521)."
 Regulatory programs , On-road vehicles regulations ,"EPA sets standards for exhaust gases, evaporative emissions, air toxics, refueling vapor recovery, and vehicle inspection and maintenance for several classes of vehicles that travel on roadways. EPA's ""light-duty vehicles"" regulations cover passenger cars, minivans, passenger vans, pickup trucks, and SUVs. ""Heavy-duty vehicles"" regulations cover large trucks and buses. EPA first issued motorcycle emissions regulations in 1977 (42 FR 1122) and updated them in 2004 (69 FR 2397). Vehicle testing programThe air pollution testing system for motor vehicles was originally developed in 1972 and used driving cycles designed to simulate driving during rush-hour in Los Angeles during that era."
 Regulatory programs , On-road vehicles regulations ,"Until 1984, EPA reported the exact fuel economy figures calculated from the test. In 1984, EPA began adjusting city (aka Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule or UDDS) results downward by 10% and highway (aka HighWay Fuel Economy Test or HWFET) results by 22% to compensate for changes in driving conditions since 1972, and to better correlate the EPA test results with real-world driving. In 1996, EPA proposed updating the Federal Testing Procedures to add a new higher-speed test (US06) and an air-conditioner-on test (SC03) to further improve the correlation of fuel economy and emission estimates with real-world reports."
 Regulatory programs , On-road vehicles regulations ,"In December 2006 the updated testing methodology was finalized to be implemented in model year 2008 vehicles and set the precedent of a 12-year review cycle for the test procedures.In February 2005, EPA launched a program called ""Your MPG"" that allows drivers to add real-world fuel economy statistics into a database on EPA's fuel economy website and compare them with others and with the original EPA test results.EPA conducts fuel economy tests on very few vehicles. Two-thirds of the vehicles the EPA tests themselves are randomly selected and the remaining third is tested for specific reasons."
 Regulatory programs , On-road vehicles regulations ,"Although originally created as a reference point for fossil-fueled vehicles, driving cycles have been used for estimating how many miles an electric vehicle will get on a single charge."
 Regulatory programs , Non-road vehicles regulations ,"The 1970 CAA amendments provided for regulation of aircraft emissions (42 U.S.C. § 7571), and EPA began regulating in 1973. In 2012, EPA finalized its newest restrictions on NOx emissions from gas turbine aircraft engines with rated thrusts above 26.7 kiloNewton (3 short ton-force), meaning primarily commercial jet aircraft engines, intended to match international standards. EPA has been investigating whether to regulate lead in fuels for small aircraft since 2010, but has not yet acted. The 1990 CAA Amendments (Pub. L. 101–549 § 222) added rules for a ""nonroad"" engine program (42 U.S.C."
 Regulatory programs , Non-road vehicles regulations ,"§ 7547), which expanded EPA regulation to locomotives, heavy equipment and small equipment engines fueled by diesel (compression-ignition), and gas and other fuels (spark-ignition), and marine transport."
 Regulatory programs , Voluntary programs ,"EPA has developed a variety of voluntary programs to incentivize and promote reduction in transportation-related air pollution, including elements of the Clean Diesel Campaign, Ports Initiative, SmartWay program, and others."
 Regulatory programs , Fuel controls ,"The federal government has regulated the chemical composition of transportation fuels since 1967, with significant new authority added in 1970 to protect public health. One of EPA's earliest actions was the elimination of lead in U.S. gasoline beginning in 1971 (36 FR 1486, 37 FR 3882, 38 FR 33734), a project that has been described as ""one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century."" EPA continues to regulate the chemical composition of gasoline, avgas, and diesel fuel in the United States."
 Regulatory programs , Stationary source operating permits ,"The 1990 amendments authorized a national operating permit program, sometimes called the ""Title V Program"", covering thousands of large industrial and commercial sources. It required large businesses to address pollutants released into the air, measure their quantity, and have a plan to control and minimize them as well as to periodically report. This consolidated requirements for a facility into a single document.: 19 In non-attainment areas, permits were required for sources that emit as little as 50, 25, or 10 tons per year of VOCs depending on the severity of the region's non-attainment status."
 Regulatory programs , Stationary source operating permits ,"Most permits are issued by state and local agencies. If the state does not adequately monitor requirements, the EPA may take control. The public may request to view the permits by contacting the EPA. The permit is limited to no more than five years and requires a renewal."
 Regulatory programs , Monitoring and enforcement ,"One of the most public aspects of the Clean Air Act, EPA is empowered to monitor compliance with the law's many requirements, seek penalties for violations, and compel regulated entities to come into compliance. Enforcement cases are usually settled, with penalties assessed well below maximum statutory limits. Recently, many of the largest Clean Air Act settlements have been reached with automakers accused of circumventing the Act's vehicle and fuel standards (e.g., the 2015 ""Dieselgate"" scandal)."
 Regulatory programs , Greenhouse gas regulation ,"Much of EPA's regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions occurs under the programs discussed above. EPA began regulating GHG emissions following the Supreme Court's ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA, the EPA's subsequent endangerment finding, and development of specific regulations for various sources. The EPA's authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions was questioned by the Supreme Court in West Virginia v."
 Regulatory programs , Greenhouse gas regulation ,"EPA but restored by Congress with the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which clarified that carbon dioxide is one of the pollutants covered by the Clean Air Act.Standards for mobile sources have been established pursuant to Section 202 of the CAA, and GHGs from stationary sources are controlled under the authority of Part C of Title I of the Act."
 Regulatory programs , Greenhouse gas regulation ,"The EPA's auto emission standards for greenhouse gas emissions issued in 2010 and 2012 are intended to cut emissions from targeted vehicles by half, double fuel economy of passenger cars and light-duty trucks by 2025 and save over $4 billion barrels of oil and $1.7 trillion for consumers. The agency has also proposed a two-phase program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for medium and heavy duty trucks and buses. In addition, EPA oversees the national greenhouse gas inventory reporting program.Following the Supreme Court decision in West Virginia v."
 Regulatory programs , Greenhouse gas regulation ,"EPA, which ruled that Congress did not grant EPA to require ""outside the fence"" options for limiting carbon dioxide at power plants, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which in amending the Clean Air Act, specifically defined carbon dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride as greenhouse gases to be regulated by the EPA, as well as giving the EPA the ability to regulate the inclusion of renewable sources, notably, through a $27 billion green bank, among other methods."
 Regulatory programs , Others ,"Other important but less foundational Clean Air Act regulatory programs tend to build on or cut across the above programs: Risk Assessment. Although not a regulatory program per se, many EPA regulatory programs involve risk assessment and management. Over the years, EPA has undertaken to unify and organize its many risk assessment processes. The 1990 CAA Amendments created a Commission on Risk Assessment and Management tasked with making recommendations for a risk assessment framework, and many subsequent reports have built on this work. Visibility and Regional Haze."
 Regulatory programs , Others ,"EPA monitors visibility and air clarity (haze) at 156 protected parks and wilderness areas, and requires states to develop plans to improve visibility by reducing pollutants that contribute to haze. Interstate pollution control. The Clean Air Act's ""good neighbor"" provision requires states to control emissions that will significantly contribute to NAAQS nonattainment or maintenance in a downwind state. EPA has struggled to enact regulations that implement this requirement for many years. It developed the ""Clean Air Interstate Rule"" between 2003 and 2005, but this was overturned by the courts in 2008."
 Regulatory programs , Others ,"EPA then developed the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule between 2009 and 2011, and it continues to be litigated as EPA updates it. Startup, Shutdown, & Malfunction. EPA promulgates rules for states to address excess emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, when facility emissions may temporarily be much higher than standard regulatory limits."
 The Clean Air Act and states , State implementation plans ,"The 1963 act required development of State Implementation Plans (SIPs) as part of a cooperative federalist program for developing pollution control standards and programs. Rather than create a solely national program, the CAA imposes responsibilities on the U.S. states to create plans to implement the Act's requirements. EPA then reviews, amends, and approves those plans. EPA first promulgated SIP regulations in 1971 and 1972."
 The Clean Air Act and states , Non-attainment areas ,"The 1977 CAA Amendments added SIP requirements for areas that had not attained the applicable NAAQS (""nonattainment areas""). In these areas, states were required to adopt plans that made ""reasonable further progress"" toward attainment until all ""reasonably available control measures"" could be adopted. As progress on attainment was much slower than Congress originally instructed, major amendments to SIP requirements in nonattainment areas were part of the 1990 CAA Amendments."
 The Clean Air Act and states , Prevention of significant deterioration ,"The 1977 CAA Amendments modified the SIP requirements by adding ""Prevention of Significant Deterioration"" (PSD) requirements. These requirements protect areas, including particularly wilderness areas and national parks, that already met the NAAQS. The PSD provision requires SIPs to preserve good quality air in addition to cleaning up bad air. The new law also required New Source Review (investigations of proposed construction of new polluting facilities) to examine whether PSD requirements would be met."
 The Clean Air Act and states , Federalism ,"The Constitution contains no provisions listing environmental standards as an enumerated Federal power, and until 1970 these were essentially handled at the state and local level. However, legislators of the 1960s had been heavily influenced by New Deal-era ideologies of government, allowing considerable expansion of Federal authority, often in excess of what was strictly allowed in the Constitution. The Clean Air Act provided the EPA with enforcement authority and requiring states to develop State Implementation Plans for how they would meet new national ambient air quality standards by 1977. This cooperative federal model continues today."
 The Clean Air Act and states , Federalism ,"The law recognizes that states should lead in carrying out the Clean Air Act, because pollution control problems often require special understanding of local conditions such as geography, industrial activity, transportation and housing patterns. However, states are not allowed to have weaker controls than the national minimum criteria set by EPA. EPA must approve each SIP, and if a SIP is not acceptable, EPA can retain CAA enforcement in that state. For example, California was unable to meet the new standards set by the 1970 amendments, which led to a lawsuit and a federal state implementation plan for the state."
 The Clean Air Act and states , Federalism ,"The federal government also assists the states by providing scientific research, expert studies, engineering designs, and money to support clean air programs. The law also prevents states from setting standards that are more strict than the federal standards, but carves out a special exemption for California due to its past issues with smog pollution in the metropolitan areas. In practice, when California's environmental agencies decide on new vehicle emission standards, they are submitted to the EPA for approval under this waiver, with the most recent approval in 2009."
 The Clean Air Act and states , Federalism ,"The California standard was adopted by twelve other states, and established the de facto standard that automobile manufacturers subsequently accepted, to avoid having to develop different emission systems in their vehicles for different states. However, in September 2019, President Donald Trump attempted to revoke this waiver, arguing that the stricter emissions have made cars too expensive, and by removing them, will make vehicles safer. EPA's Andrew Wheeler also stated that while the agency respects federalism, it could not allow one state to dictate standards for the entire nation."
 The Clean Air Act and states , Federalism ,"California's governor Gavin Newsom considered the move part of Trump's ""political vendetta"" against California and stated his intent to sue the federal government. Twenty-three states, along with the District of Columbia and the cities of New York City and Los Angeles, joined California in a federal lawsuit challenging the administration's decision. In March 2022 the Biden administration reversed the Trump-era rule, allowing California to again set stricter auto emissions standards. Between the Second Industrial Revolution and the 1960s, the United States experienced increasingly severe air pollution."
 The Clean Air Act and states , Federalism ,"Following the 1948 Donora smog event, the public began to discuss air pollution as a major problem, states began to pass a series of laws to reduce air pollution, and Congress began discussing whether to take further action in response."
 The Clean Air Act and states , Federalism ,"At the time, the primary federal agencies interested in air pollution were the United States Bureau of Mines, which was interested in ""smoke abatement"" (reducing smoke from coal burning), and the United States Public Health Service, which handled industrial hygiene and was concerned with the causes of lung health problems.After several years of proposals and hearings, Congress passed the first federal legislation to address air pollution in 1955. The Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 authorized a research and training program, sending $3 million per year to the U.S."
 The Clean Air Act and states , Federalism ,"Public Health Service for five years, but did not directly regulate pollution sources. The 1955 Act's research program was extended in 1959, 1960, and 1962 while Congress considered whether to regulate further. Beginning in 1963, Congress began expanding federal air pollution control law to accelerate the elimination of air pollution throughout the country. The new law's programs were initially administered by the U.S. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Air Pollution Office of the U.S. Public Health Service, until they were transferred to the newly created EPA immediately before major amendments in 1970."
 The Clean Air Act and states , Federalism ,"EPA has administered the Clean Air Act ever since, and Congress added major regulatory programs in 1977 and 1990. Most recently, the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA resulted in an expansion of EPA's CAA regulatory activities to cover greenhouse gases."
 History , Clean Air Act of 1963 and early amendments ,"The Clean Air Act of 1963 (Pub. L. 88–206) was the first federal legislation to permit the U.S. federal government to take direct action to control air pollution. It extended the 1955 research program, encouraged cooperative state, local, and federal action to reduce air pollution, appropriated $95 million over three years to support the development of state pollution control programs, and authorized the HEW Secretary to organize conferences and take direct action against interstate air pollution where state action was deemed to be insufficient.The Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act (Pub. L."
 History , Clean Air Act of 1963 and early amendments ,"89–272) amended the 1963 Clean Air Act and set the first federal vehicle emissions standards, beginning with the 1968 models. These standards were reductions from 1963 emissions levels: 72% reduction for hydrocarbons, 56% reduction for carbon monoxide, and 100% reduction for crankcase hydrocarbons.. The law also added a new section to authorize abatement of international air pollution. The Air Quality Act of 1967 (Pub. L."
 History , Clean Air Act of 1963 and early amendments ,"90–148) authorized planning grants to state air pollution control agencies, permitted the creation of interstate air pollution control agencies, and required HEW to define air quality regions and develop technical documentation that would allow states to set ambient air quality and pollution control technology standards, and required states to submit implementation plans for improvement of air quality, and permitted HEW to take direct abatement action in air pollution emergencies. It also authorized expanded studies of air pollutant emission inventories, ambient monitoring techniques, and control techniques."
 History , Clean Air Act of 1963 and early amendments ,"This enabled the federal government to increase its activities to investigate enforcing interstate air pollution transport, and, for the first time, to perform far-reaching ambient monitoring studies and stationary source inspections. The 1967 act also authorized expanded studies of air pollutant emission inventories, ambient monitoring techniques, and control techniques. While only six states had air pollution programs in 1960, all 50 states had air pollution programs by 1970 due to the federal funding and legislation of the 1960s."
 History , 1970 and 1977 amendments ,"In the Clean Air Amendments of 1970 (Pub. L. 91–604), Congress greatly expanded the federal mandate by requiring comprehensive federal and state regulations for both industrial and mobile sources. The law established the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), New Source Performance Standards (NSPS); and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs), and significantly strengthened federal enforcement authority, all toward achieving aggressive air pollution reduction goals. To implement the strict amendments, EPA Administrator William Ruckelshaus spent 60% of his time during his first term on the automobile industry, whose emissions were to be reduced 90% under the new law."
 History , 1970 and 1977 amendments ,"Senators had been frustrated at the industry's failure to cut emissions under previous, weaker air laws.Major amendments were added to the Clean Air Act in 1977 (1977 CAAA) (91 Stat. 685, Pub. L. 95–95). The 1977 Amendments primarily concerned provisions for the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) of air quality in areas attaining the NAAQS. The 1977 CAAA also contained requirements pertaining to sources in non-attainment areas for NAAQS. A non-attainment area is a geographic area that does not meet one or more of the federal air quality standards."
 History , 1970 and 1977 amendments ,Both of these 1977 CAAA established major permit review requirements to ensure attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS. These amendments also included the adoption of an offset trading policy originally applied to Los Angeles in 1974 that enables new sources to offset their emissions by purchasing extra reductions from existing sources.The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 required Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) of air quality for areas attaining the NAAQS and added requirements for non-attainment areas.
 History , 1990 amendments ,"Another set of major amendments to the Clean Air Act occurred in 1990 (1990 CAAA) (104 Stat. 2468, Pub. L. 101–549). The 1990 CAAA substantially increased the authority and responsibility of the federal government. New regulatory programs were authorized for control of acid deposition (acid rain) and for the issuance of stationary source operating permits. The NESHAPs were incorporated into a greatly expanded program for controlling toxic air pollutants. The provisions for attainment and maintenance of NAAQS were substantially modified and expanded."
 History , 1990 amendments ,"Other revisions included provisions regarding stratospheric ozone protection, increased enforcement authority, and expanded research programs.The 1990 Clean Air Act added regulatory programs for control of acid deposition (acid rain) and stationary source operating permits. The provisions aimed at reducing sulfur dioxide emissions included a cap-and-trade program, which gave power companies more flexibility in meeting the law's goals compared to earlier iterations of the Clean Air Act."
 History , 1990 amendments ,"The amendments moved considerably beyond the original criteria pollutants, expanding the NESHAP program with a list of 189 hazardous air pollutants to be controlled within hundreds of source categories, according to a specific schedule.: 16 The NAAQS program was also expanded. Other new provisions covered stratospheric ozone protection, increased enforcement authority and expanded research programs.Further amendments were made in 1990 to address the problems of acid rain, ozone depletion, and toxic air pollution, and to establish a national permit program for stationary sources, and increased enforcement authority."
 History , 1990 amendments ,"The amendments also established new auto gasoline reformulation requirements, set Reid vapor pressure (RVP) standards to control evaporative emissions from gasoline, and mandated new gasoline formulations sold from May to September in many states. Reviewing his tenure as EPA Administrator under President George H. W. Bush, William K. Reilly characterized passage of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act as his most notable accomplishment.The 1990 amendments also included a requirement for the Department of Labor to issue, no later than 12 months from the date of publication of the amendments, and in collaboration with the EPA, a ""process safety standard""."
 History , 1990 amendments ,"The text also highlighted the 14 principles on which this should be based. These were implemented in 1992 in OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation (Title 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart H § 1910.119), as well as in EPA's 1996 Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (Title 40 CFR Part 68)."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"The Inflation Reduction Act, the budget reconciliation bill signed by President Joe Biden in August 2022, amends the Clean Air Act to allow the EPA to administer $27 billion in grants to green banks nationwide, through a competitive funding mechanism to be called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. $14 billion will go to a select few nonprofit green banks for a broad variety of direct investments in decarbonization startups, $6 billion will go to investments in low-income and historically disadvantaged communities, and $7 billion will go to distributed solar power in similar communities with no financing alternatives."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"It is expected to generate high rates of return for the government on private sector investments. It also designates carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as substances to be regulated by the EPA, in reaction to the Supreme Court case West Virginia v. EPA, which limited the EPA's authority to institute a program such as the Obama-era Clean Power Plan. The IRA also allows the EPA more leeway to promote renewable energy."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"According to a 2022 review study in the Journal of Economic Literature, there is overwhelming causal evidence that shows that the CAA improved air quality.According to the most recent study by EPA, when compared to the baseline of the 1970 and 1977 regulatory programs, by 2020 the updates initiated by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments would be costing the United States about $60 billion per year, while benefiting the United States (in monetized health and lives saved) about $2 trillion per year."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"In 2020, a study prepared for the Natural Resources Defense Council estimated annual benefits at 370,000 avoided premature deaths, 189,000 fewer hospital admissions, and net economic benefits of up to $3.8 trillion (32 times the cost of the regulations). Other studies have reached similar conclusions.Mobile sources including automobiles, trains, and boat engines have become 99% cleaner for pollutants like hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particle emissions since the 1970s."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"The allowable emissions of volatile organic chemicals, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and lead from individual cars have also been reduced by more than 90%, resulting in decreased national emissions of these pollutants despite a more than 400% increase in total miles driven yearly. Since the 1980s, 1/4th of ground level ozone has been cut, mercury emissions have been cut by 80%, and since the change from leaded gas to unleaded gas 90% of atmospheric lead pollution has been reduced."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"A 2018 study found that the Clean Air Act contributed to the 60% decline in pollution emissions by the manufacturing industry between 1990 and 2008. Since its inception, the authority given to the EPA by Congress and the EPA's rulemaking within the Clean Air Act has been subject to numerous lawsuits. Some of the major suits where the Clean Air Act has been focal point of litigation include the following: Train v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 421 U.S."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"60 (1975) Under the Clean Air Act, states were required to submit their implementation plans within nine months of the EPA's promulgation of the new standards. The EPA approved several state plans that allowed for variances in their emissions limitations, and the Natural Resources Defense Council challenged that approval."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"The Supreme Court held that the EPA's approval was valid, and that as long as the “ultimate effect of a State's choice of emission limitations is compliance with the national standards for ambient air,” a state is “at liberty to adopt whatever mix of emission limitations it deems best suited to its particular situation.”Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"837 (1984) The Clean Air Act instructed the EPA to regulate emissions from sources of air pollution, but did not define what should be considered a source for the emission of air pollution, so the EPA had interpreted what a source was based on the legislation. The EPA's interpretation was challenged, but after review, the Supreme Court ruled in a 7–0 decision that the EPA had judicial deference to establish their own interpretation of law when the law is ambiguous and the interpretation is reasonable and consistent."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"This principle has come to be known as the Chevron deference applying to any executive agency granted powers from Congress.Whitman v. American Trucking Ass'ns, Inc., 531 U.S. 457 (2001) Following the EPA's rulemaking related to setting NAAQS standards related to diesel truck emissions, the trucking industry challenged the EPA's rule in lower courts, asserting the EPA's rule failed to justify reasoning for these new levels and violated the nondelegation doctrine. The D.C. Circuit Court found in favor of the trucking industry, determining that the EPA's rule did not consider the costs of implementing emissions regulations and controls."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"The Supreme Court reversed the D.C. District Court's ruling, affirming that not only was the delegation of power from Congress to the EPA by the Clean Air Act constitutional, but that the law did not require the EPA to consider costs as part of its determination for air quality controls.Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, 549 U.S."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"497 (2007) With pressure from states and environmental groups on the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles, the EPA determined in 2003 that the language of the Clean Air Act did not allow them to regulate emissions from motor vehicles, nor were they motivated to set such regulations even if they were able to. Multiple states and agencies sued the EPA for failing to act on what they considered to be harmful air pollutants."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"The Supreme Court ruled 5–4 that not only did the Clean Air Act mandate the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as air pollutants, but that failing to regulate these emissions would leave the EPA liable to further litigation. While the decision has remained contentious, the Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA was considered landmark, as it opened up the courts for further environmental lawsuits to force entities to respond to climate change.American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut, 564 U.S."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"410 (2011) Several states and cities sued electric utility companies to force them to use a cap-and-trade system to reduce their emissions under a claim their emissions were a public nuisance. The Supreme Court ruled in an 8–0 decision that private companies cannot be sued by other parties for emissions-related issues, as this is a power specifically delegated to the EPA through the Clean Air Act under federal common law.Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency, 573 U.S."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"302 (2014) The EPA issued new rules in 2010 that expanded emissions regulations for both regulated air pollutants and greenhouse gases to light and heavy engines and smaller stationary sources. These expanded rules were challenged by several power companies and regulatory groups, as they greatly expanded what types of facilities would need to acquire environmental permits prior to construction. The Supreme Court generally upheld the EPA's powers through the Clean Air Act, through it vacated portions of the EPA's new rules affecting smaller sources.Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"743 (2015) In 2012, the EPA issued new rules that identified new pollutants such as mercury as hazardous materials to be regulated in power plant emissions. The cost of implementing mercury pollution controls on new and existing plants can be expensive, and several states, companies, and other organizations sued the EPA that their analysis leading to these new rules did not consider the cost factor involved."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"The Supreme Court ruled 5–4 that the EPA's failure to consider the costs of these pollution controls was inappropriate, and that cost must be a factor in any finding that the EPA finds ""necessary and appropriate"" under the Clean Air Act.West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. ___ (2022) In 2014, the EPA under the Obama administration proposed the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which aimed to combat climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants. Using its authority under 42 U.S.C. § 7411(d), the agency sought to regulate emissions from existing power plants."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"After the final plan was announced in 2015, a number of states successfully petitioned federal courts for an emergency stay to block the implementation of the plan. In 2017, the CPP never having been implemented, the EPA under the Trump administration enacted the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, which repealed the CPP. A different set of states and environmental advocacy groups challenged the ACE rule in federal court, and on January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the rule because it relied on a flawed interpretation of § 7411(d)."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"A number of states petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing that the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of § 7411(d) was too broad, and four petitions were consolidated as West Virginia v. EPA. On June 30, 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in a 6–3 decision that the CPP was invalid because it fell under the major questions doctrine and thus required more specific Congressional approval than could reasonably be argued to be present in the statute."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"As poor air quality is still an issue in the United States, it's been noted that it is 1.5 times more likely for a minority to live in an area burdened with air pollution than it is for a majority person. While the United States is still being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, research has shown that if someone lives in an area that experiences air pollution, they are 8% more likely to experience long-term COVID effects and could potentially have a fatal outcome."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"This creates a disparity between minority communities in America and majority Americans even though the air pollution that these communities face is often a result of redlining which places minority community in areas where the industries that pollute the air, as well as high traffic roadways, reside. Solutions proposed by the Sierra Club and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) include funding clean energy transportation services, lower acceptable emission levels, and enforce the Clean Air Act that is already in place more intensely."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"While the Clean Air Act has been generally effective since it was enacted in 1970, there have been efforts from the fossil fuel industry to override the regulations which have led to worse air pollution in many communities.An example of an area where the Clean Air Act has not been too effective is the San Joaquin Valley which experiences poor air quality conditions that stem from harmful agricultural practices, heavy traffic on major roadways, and the oil industrial businesses."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"Research shows that the leading air pollutant in the region is known as, PM 2.5, or fine particulate matter and causes health issues in pregnant women exposed to it such as more severe asthma, decreased FEV1, compromised immunity, and an increased risk of premature birth. Other symptoms that come from exposure to PM 2.5 include chronic bronchitis, reduced lung function in children, and heart and lung-related hospitalizations that can potentially lead to premature death especially if the individual has previous health concerns."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"It's been noted that in 2004, a mass decrease in PM 2.5 pollution occurred because of a decline in agricultural and biomass burning practices, however, it is still a common occurrence today and PM 2.5 levels have increased. Organizations such as the California Air Resources Board (CARB) have recommended that more sufficient regulations be implemented in the San Joaquin Valley to reduce toxic emissions into the atmosphere."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"There are now efforts from the EPA, the CARB, and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District to enforce regulations from the Clean Air Act and fund further efforts to live in a more sustainable fashion. As of 2017, some US cities still do not meet all national ambient air quality standards."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"It is likely that tens of thousands of premature deaths are still being caused by fine-particle pollution and ground-level ozone pollution.Climate change poses a challenge to the management of conventional air pollutants in the United States due to warmer, dryer summer conditions that can lead to increased air stagnation episodes."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"Prolonged droughts that may contribute to wildfires would also result in regionally high levels of air particles.Transboundary air pollution (both entering and exiting the United States) is not directly regulated by the Clean Air Act, requiring international negotiations and ongoing agreements with other nations, particularly Canada and Mexico.Environmental justice continues to be an ongoing challenge for the Clean Air Act. By promoting pollution reduction, the Clean Air Act helps reduce heightened exposure to air pollution among minority and low-income communities. But African American populations are ""consistently over represented"" in areas with the poorest air quality."
 History , 2022 amendments ,"Dense populations of low-income and minority communities inhabit the most polluted areas across the United States, which is considered to exacerbate health problems among these populations. High levels of exposure to air pollution is linked to several health conditions, including asthma, cancer, premature death, and infant mortality, each of which disproportionately impact minority and low-income communities. The pollution reduction achieved by the Clean Air Act is associated with a decline in each of these conditions and can promote environmental justice for communities that are disproportionately impacted by air pollution and diminished health status.

 Name ,,"While in operation the landfill was known as Curtis Peay Landfill. As of 2020, it is most often referred to as Glen Lily Landfill in City of Bowling Green documents. In media reports, it is often cited as Glen Lily Road Landfill, and in some United States Environmental Protection Agency documentation it is known simply as Bowling Green Old Landfill. In late 1974, the City of Bowling Green purchased two parcels land of in a rural, unincorporated area of Warren County for the purposes of creating a landfill to be used by the city's municipal garbage collection program."
 Name ,,"The land, situated near the intersection of Glen Lily Road and Price Chapel Road was zoned for agriculture. Opposition from local residents concerned over traffic on Glen Lily Road resulted in garbage deliveries taking a more circuitous route along Morgantown Road and Price Chapel Road. The landfill was placed atop a hill over a karst feature. Later dye studies showed that the landfill property sits atop two groundwater drainage basins: one flowing to the east towards Barren River, and another, on the land primarily under the landfill, flowing to the west towards Westbrook Creek, a tributary of Gasper River."
 Name ,,"The landfill, reported to cover 30 acres of the 270-acre site, opened for operation in 1975 and accepted both residential and industrial waste. The landfill was full by 1979 and was idled by the City of Bowling Green which had opened a new landfill in an abandoned strip mine in nearby Butler County. As early as 1979 it was noted that the landfill had accepted waste drums without examining their contents."
 Name ,,"In 1981, the landfill joined Kentucky's priority list of Superfund sites.In September 1985, a state inspection determined that the landfill contained pollutants and ordered the City of Bowling Green to remediate the site. in 1986, six chemicals, including carcinogens, were found to be leaching from the site into nearby groundwater. The chemical phenol was among the pollutants identified.in 1989, eight test wells were drilled to monitor the site. Twenty-one organic pollutants on a Federal priority list were found at that time. An additional two organic pollutants not on the list were also identified."
 Name ,,"That same year, the Kentucky Cabinet of Natural Resources refused a request from the City of Bowling Green to pay for remediation; however, the Cabinet agreed with the City's plan to attempt to identify customers responsible for disposing of toxins which ended up at the site. Eventually the City identified thirty-one potential polluters.. As late as 1989, the City was applying a deodorant to cover the smell of decaying garbage in the landfill. Also in 1989, the City instituted a surcharge on garbage collection bills to pay for landfill remediation which by 1990 were estimated at $3 million."
 Name ,,"The city expected to be monitoring the site until 2019.At some point the landfill was capped with a clay cap which was found to be insufficient. By 1992, the initial cap had been replaced with an impermeable plastic membrane which itself was covered by a clay cap. The City also installed a system to collect landfill leachate into three concrete storage tanks which are monitored and drained as needed. The collected leachate is removed from the site and treated by a contractor."
 Name ,,"In 1997, responsibility for the site was transferred from the state back to the City.At some point in the 1990s, escaping methane gas produced as a result of decomposition of organic materials in the landfill resulted in a fire. In order to better control the escaping gasses, 128 passive gas vents were installed at the site. Another fire of unknown origin erupted near the landfill's methane vents in March 2007. This grass and brush fire required all nine of Warren County's volunteer fire departments to respond."
 Name ,,"In 2008, the City received a proposal that escaping methane be captured for commercial use.in 2010, it was noticed that the leachate tanks were filling faster than expected. A study found that stormwater retention basins at the site had not been properly lined and were leaking into the leachate tanks. A $446.790 project extended the lining to eliminate most of the stormwater seepage significantly reducing the frequency at which the tanks needed to be drained. The City paid for the project upfront but believed it could be reimbursed by state funds."
 Name ,,"Stormwater, which is not required to be treated, continues to be discharged from six points along the landfill into unnamed tributaries of Westbrook Creek. Groundwater monitoring was eliminated in 2010, and stormwater monitoring was reduced in 2015.In 1991, the City borrowed nearly $3 million to create a Landfill Closure Special Revenue Fund to fund maintenance of both the Glen Lily and Butler County landfills. As of 2010, $1.36 million remained in the fund and the city expected to be responsible for both landfills until 2034."
 Name ,,"The cost of landfill maintenance was a primary reason for the City to exit the municipal garbage service. On January 7, 2020, the Bowling Green City Commission voted to approve a lease of the landfill property to organizers of a powersports event to be held May 16-17, 2020."
 Name ,,"The $3,000 lease is for the two day May event with access before and after the event for preparation and cleanup to be allowed at the City's discretion; however, it was reported that the organizers were working with the City to permanently acquire the landfill property from the city for a nominal fee and convert into a racing facility known as PowerPlex Park which organizers touted as a ""Disneyland of motorsports."" Organizers plan to build multiple race courses and permanent structures at the site to accommodate 20,000 event attendees."
 Name ,,"On March 2, 2020, local residents held a public meeting to discuss the proposed use for the landfill; many attendees expressed concerns with event noise, the state of transportation infrastructure in the area, and the environmental impact of the facility. Residents also expressed concerns at the March 3, 2020 meeting of the Bowling Green City Commission. As of March 2020, no vote on the proposed deal to transfer the land to event organizers has been scheduled."
 Name ,,"The landfill site also hosts a communications tower used by the City of Bowling Green, and the site continues to be used by the City as a dump site for storm debris. Notably, portions of the site were used as a dump site for debris from the 2021 Bowling Green tornadoes. List of Superfund sites in Kentucky Landfills in the United States"
 Cleanup activities ,,"The site is being addressed through federal, state and potentially responsible party actions. Several five-year reviews have been conducted by the EPA which ensure that the remedies put in place will protect public health and the environment, and function as the site decision documents intended. The most recent of these reviews has revealed that without further evaluation of the groundwater and leachate extraction systems, a protectiveness determination for the remedy at the site cannot be made. Attainment of the cleanup standards and implementation of institutional controls is required in order to continue to protect the remedy."
 Cleanup activities ,,"Contaminants found at this site include naphthalene, benzene, xylene, arsenic, ethylbenzene, trichloroethene, tetrachloroethene, dichloroethene, vinyl chloride, PCBs and lead. The site's long-term remedy included: a landfill cover relocation of impacted soils beneath landfill cover containment of landfill areas groundwater extraction, treatment and monitoring wetland mitigation and creationOperation and maintenance activities are ongoing since construction of the remedy took place between 1996 and 1999. The EPA has set activity and use limitations, called institutional controls, in place at this site. Institutional controls are activity and use limitations set in place by the EPA."
 Cleanup activities ,,"By using institutional controls, exposure to contamination can be reduced by limiting land and/or resource use, as well as guiding human behavior. For example, when land is not consistent with a certain level of cleanup, zoning restrictions may be set in place to prevent residential use. No enforcement activities are currently underway at the G&H Site. Risks and pathways addressed by the cleanup include health risks from people ingesting or touching contaminants in soil, surface water and groundwater."
 Cleanup activities ,,"Assessments indicate that across the entire site there are currently no unacceptable human exposure pathways and the EPA has determined the site is under control for human exposure. The EPA reviewed all information on known and reasonably expected groundwater contamination and concluded the migration of contaminated groundwater is stabilized and there is no unacceptable discharge to surface water. The EPA will conduct monitoring to confirm that affected groundwater remains in the original area of contamination. The physical construction of the cleanup is complete for the entire site. However, the site is not ready for anticipated use."

 Background , Health implications of water pollution ,"Contamination of drinking water supplies can not only occur in the source water but also in the distribution system. Sources of water contamination include naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (arsenic, radon, uranium), local land use practices (fertilizers, pesticides, concentrated feeding operations), manufacturing processes, and sewer overflows or wastewater releases. Some examples of health implications of water contamination are gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people whose immune systems are compromised because of AIDS, chemotherapy, or transplant medications, may be especially susceptible to illness from some contaminants."
 Background , Gastrointestinal illness ,"Gastrointestinal disorders include such conditions as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, perianal abscesses, anal fistulas, perianal infections, diverticular diseases, colitis, colon polyps and cancer. In general, children and the elderly are at highest risk for gastrointestinal disease. In a study investigating the association between drinking water quality and gastrointestinal illness in the elderly of Philadelphia, scientists found water quality 9 to 11 days before the visit was negatively associated with hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness, with an interquartile range increase in turbidity being associated with a 9% increase ."
 Background , Gastrointestinal illness ,The association was stronger in those over 75 than in the population aged 65–74. This example is a small reflection of residents of the United States remain at risk of waterborne gastrointestinal illness under current water treatment practices.
 Background , Reproductive problems ,"Reproductive problems refer to any illness of the reproductive system. New research by Brunel University and the University of Exeter strengthens the relationship between water pollution and rising male fertility problems. Study identified a group of chemicals that act as anti-androgens in polluted water, which inhibits the function of the male hormone, testosterone, reducing male fertility."
 Background , Neurological disorders ,"Neurological disorders are diseases of the brain, spine and the nerves that connect them. The new study of more than 700 people in California's Central Valley found that those who likely consumed contaminated private well water had a higher rate of Parkinson's. The risk was 90 percent higher for those who had private wells near fields sprayed with widely used insecticides. Unlike water supplies in large cities, private wells are mostly unregulated and are not monitored for contaminants."
 Background , Neurological disorders ,"Many of them exist at shallow depths of less than 20 yards, and some of the crop chemicals used to kill pests and weeds can flow into ground water. Therefore, private wells are likely to contain pesticides, which can attack developing brains (womb or infancy), leading to neurological diseases later in life."

Under the current Supreme Court rule issued in 2023, all waters (such as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes) with a ""a continuous surface connection"" to ""navigable waters"" are covered under the CWA.The 1972 statute frequently uses the term ""navigable waters"" but also defines the term as ""waters of the United States, including the territorial seas."" Regulations interpreting the 1972 law have included water features such as intermittent streams, playa lakes, prairie potholes, sloughs and wetlands as ""waters of the United States."" In 2006, in Rapanos v."
 Background , Neurological disorders ,"United States, a plurality of the US Supreme Court held that the term ""waters of the United States"" ""includes only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water 'forming geographic features' that are described in ordinary parlance as 'streams[,]... oceans, rivers, [and] lakes.'"" Since Rapanos, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have attempted to define protected waters in the context of Rapanos through the 2015 Clean Water Rule, but this has been highly controversial. The agencies considered CWA to cover bodies of water with a ""significant nexus"" with traditional navigable waters."
 Background , Neurological disorders ,"In 2023, the Supreme Court rejected the ""significant nexus"" test in Sackett v. EPA and established the current definition."
 Pollution control strategy , Point sources ,"The CWA introduced the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), a permit system for regulating point sources of pollution. Point sources include: industrial facilities (including manufacturing, mining, shipping activities, oil and gas extraction and service industries). municipal governments (particularly sewage treatment plants) and other government facilities (such as military bases), and some agricultural facilities, such as animal feedlots.Point sources may not discharge pollutants to surface waters without an NPDES permit. The system is managed by EPA in partnership with state environmental agencies. EPA has authorized 47 states to issue permits directly to the discharging facilities."
 Pollution control strategy , Point sources ,"The CWA also allows tribes to issue permits, but no tribes have been authorized by EPA. In the remaining states and territories, the permits are issued by an EPA regional office. (See Titles III and IV.) In legislation prior to 1972, Congress had authorized states to develop water quality standards, which would limit discharges from facilities based on the characteristics of individual water bodies. However, those standards were to be developed only for interstate waters, and the science to support that process (i.e. data, methodology) was in the early stages of development."
 Pollution control strategy , Point sources ,"That system was not effective, and there was no permit system in place to enforce the requirements. In the 1972 CWA, Congress added the permit system and a requirement for technology-based effluent limitations.In the 2020 Supreme Court case County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund, the Court also validated that some discharges may not be point sources, but are the ""functional equivalent of a direct discharge"" to navigable waters, such as in this case, the injection of wastewater into groundwater injection wells."
 Pollution control strategy , Point sources ,"As of the time of the case's decision, this was not an area the EPA has established regulations for, and the Court instructed the EPA to work with the courts to define such functional equivalents. The Court wrote that this would likely depend most on the distance the pollutants traveled and time to reach navigable waters, with consideration for the material that the pollutants traveled through, any physical or chemical interaction of the pollutants with components in the ground, and how much of the pollutant makes it to the navigable water."
 Pollution control strategy , Point sources ,"In July 2021, following the Supreme Court decision, the Hawaii District Court determined that the Maui County sewage treatment plant's groundwater injection of sewage was the ""functional equivalent of a direct discharge"" and required the plant to obtain an NPDES permit."
 Pollution control strategy , Technology-based standards ,"The 1972 CWA created a new requirement for technology-based standards for point source discharges. EPA develops those standards for categories of dischargers, based on the performance of pollution control technologies without regard to the conditions of a particular receiving water body. The intent of Congress was to create a ""level playing field"" by establishing a basic national discharge standard for all facilities within a category, using a ""Best Available Technology."" The standard becomes the minimum regulatory requirement in a permit."
 Pollution control strategy , Technology-based standards ,"If the national standard is not sufficiently protective at a particular location, then water quality standards may be employed, and the permit authority (state or EPA) will include water quality-based effluent limitations in the permit.: 1–3"
 Pollution control strategy , Water quality standards ,"The 1972 act authorized continued use of the water quality-based approach, but in coordination with the technology-based standards. After application of technology-based standards to a permit, if water quality is still impaired for the particular water body, then the permit agency may add water quality-based limitations to that permit. The additional limitations are to be more stringent than the technology-based limitations and would require the permittee to install additional controls. Water quality standards consist of four basic elements: 1) Designated uses; 2) Water quality criteria; 3) Antidegradation policy and 4) General policies."
 Pollution control strategy , Designated uses ,"The water quality standards regulations require states and federally recognized tribes/nations to specify appropriate uses for water bodies in their jurisdiction. Identification of appropriate water uses takes into consideration the usage and value of public water supply, protection of fish, wildlife, recreational waters, agricultural, industrial and navigational water ways. Suitability of a water body is examined by states and tribes/nations usages based on physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. States and tribes/nations also examine geographical settings, scenic qualities and economic considerations to determine fitness of designated uses for water bodies."
 Pollution control strategy , Designated uses ,"If those standards indicate designated uses to be less than those currently attained, states or tribes are required to revise standards to reflect the uses that are actually being attained. For any body of water with designated uses that do not include ""fishable/swimmable"" target use that is identified in section 101(a)(2) of CWA, a ""Use Attainability Analysis"" must be conducted. Every three years, such bodies of water must be re-examined to verify if new information is available that demand a revision of the standard. If new information is available that specify “fishable/swimmable” uses can be attained, the use must be designated."
 Pollution control strategy , Water quality criteria ,"States and federally recognized Indigenous Nations protect their designated areas by adopting water quality criteria that the EPA publishes under CWA section 304(a), modifying the criteria to reflect site-specific conditions or adopting criteria based on other scientifically defensible methods. Water quality criteria can be numeric criteria that toxicity causes are known for protection against pollutants. A narrative criterion is water quality criteria which serves as a basis for limiting the toxicity of waste discharges to aquatic species. A biological criterion is based on the aquatic community which describes the number and types of species in a water body."
 Pollution control strategy , Water quality criteria ,"A nutrient criterion solely protects against nutrient over enrichment, and a sediment criterion describes conditions of contaminated and uncontaminated sediments in order to avoid undesirable effects."
 Pollution control strategy , Anti-degradation policy ,"The water quality regulations include an anti-degradation policy that requires states and tribes to establish a three-tiered anti-degradation program. Anti-degradation procedures identify steps and questions that need to be addressed when specific activities affect water quality. ""Tier 1"" requirements are applicable to all surface waters. These requirements maintain and protect current uses and the water quality conditions to support existing uses. Current uses are identified by showing that fishing, swimming, and other water uses have occurred and are suitable since November 28, 1975."
 Pollution control strategy , Anti-degradation policy ,"""Tier 2"" requirements maintains and protects water bodies with existing conditions that are better to support ""fishable/swimmable"" uses pursuant to CWA section 101(a)(2). ""Tier 3"" requirements maintain and protect water quality in ""outstanding national resource waters"" (ONRWs), which are the highest quality waters in the US with ecological significance."
 Pollution control strategy , General policies ,"States and Native American tribes also adopt general policies pertaining to water quality standards that are subject to review and approval by the EPA. Those provisions on water quality standards include mixing zones, variance, and low flow policies. Mixing zone policy is defined area surrounding a point source discharge where sewage is diluted by water. Methodology of mixing zone procedure determines the location, size, shape and quality of mixing zones. Variance policy temporarily relax water quality standard and are alternatives to removing a designated use. States and tribes may include variance as part of their water quality standard."
 Pollution control strategy , General policies ,"Variance is subject to public review every three years and warrant development towards improvement of water quality. The ""Low Flow"" policy pertains to states and tribes water quality standards that identify procedures applied to determining critical low flow conditions."
 Pollution control strategy , Laboratory test methods ,"Most NPDES permittees are required to collect samples of their wastewater and analyze the samples using test methods specified in their permits. EPA publishes analytical methods that are used by the permittees. The procedures identify chemical compounds and microbiological components of wastewater, as required by the act. Some of the chemical compound test procedures include the chemical detection of trace elements such as cancer-causing metals. Some microbiological test procedures use microbial source tracking (MST) techniques to calculate and identify biological and chemical trends that may support new regulatory limits on pollutants."
 Pollution control strategy , Nonpoint sources ,"Congress exempted some water pollution sources from the point source definition in the 1972 CWA and was unclear on the status of some other sources. Such sources were therefore considered to be nonpoint sources that were not subject to the permit program. Agricultural stormwater discharges and irrigation return flows were specifically exempted from permit requirements. Congress, however, provided support for research, technical and financial assistance programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to improve runoff management practices on farms. See Natural Resources Conservation Service."
 Pollution control strategy , Nonpoint sources ,"Stormwater runoff from industrial sources, municipal storm drains, and other sources were not specifically addressed in the 1972 law. EPA had declined to include urban runoff and industrial stormwater discharges in its initial implementation of the NPDES program, and subsequently the agency was sued by an environmental group. In 1977, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that stormwater discharges must be covered by the permit program.Research conducted starting in the late 1970s and 1980s indicated that stormwater runoff was a significant cause of water quality impairment in many parts of the US."
 Pollution control strategy , Nonpoint sources ,"In the early 1980s, the EPA conducted the Nationwide Urban Runoff Program (NURP) to document the extent of the urban stormwater problem. The agency began to develop regulations for stormwater permit coverage but encountered resistance from industry and municipalities, and there were additional rounds of litigation. The litigation was pending when Congress considered further amendments to the CWA in 1986. In the Water Quality Act of 1987, Congress responded to the stormwater problem by defining industrial stormwater dischargers and municipal separate storm sewer systems (often called ""MS4"") as point sources, and requiring them to obtain NPDES permits, by specific deadlines."
 Pollution control strategy , Nonpoint sources ,"The permit exemption for agricultural discharges continued, but Congress created several programs and grants, including a demonstration grant program at the EPA to expand the research and development of non point controls and management practices."
 Pollution control strategy , Financing of pollution controls ,"Congress created a major public works financing program for municipal sewage treatment in the 1972 CWA. A system of grants for construction of municipal sewage treatment plants was authorized and funded in Title II. In the initial program, the federal portion of each grant was up to 75 percent of a facility's capital cost, with the remainder financed by the state. In subsequent amendments Congress reduced the federal proportion of the grants and in the 1987 WQA transitioned to a revolving loan program in Title VI."
 Pollution control strategy , Financing of pollution controls ,Industrial and other private facilities are required to finance their own treatment improvements based on the polluter pays principle.
 Pollution control strategy , Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act ,"Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA) to provide an expanded credit program for water and wastewater infrastructure projects, with broader eligibility criteria than the previously authorized revolving fund unter CWA Title VI. Pursuant to WIFIA, EPA established its Water Infrastructure and Resiliency Finance Center in 2015 to help local governments and municipal utilities design innovative financing mechanisms, including public–private partnerships. Congress amended the WIFIA program in 2015, 2016 and 2018. This Act has six titles."
 Major statutory provisions , Title I - Research and Related Programs ,"Title I includes a Declaration of Goals and Policy and various grant authorizations for research programs and pollution control programs. Some of the programs authorized by the 1972 law are ongoing (e.g. section 104 research programs, section 106 pollution control programs, section 117 Chesapeake Bay Program) while other programs no longer receive funds from Congress and have been discontinued."
 Major statutory provisions , Title II - Grants for Construction of Treatment Works ,"To assist municipalities in building or expanding sewage treatment plants, also known as publicly owned treatment works (POTW), Title II established a system of construction grants. The 1972 CWA provided that federal funds would support 75% of project costs, with state and local funds providing the remaining 25%."
 Major statutory provisions , Title II - Grants for Construction of Treatment Works ,"In 1981 Congress reduced the federal funding proportion for most grants to 55%.: 4 The construction grant program was replaced by the Clean Water State Revolving Fund in the 1987 WQA (see Title VI), although some local utilities continued to receive ""special purpose project grants"" directly from Congress, through a budgetary procedure known as ""earmarking."": 5"
 Major statutory provisions , Discharge permits required ,"Section 301 of the Act prohibits discharges to waters of the U.S. except with a permit. (See Title IV for discussion of permit programs.) Recreational vessels are exempt from the permit requirements, but vessel operators must implement Best Management Practices to control their discharges. (See Regulation of ship pollution in the United States.)"
 Major statutory provisions , Technology-Based Standards Program ,"Under the 1972 act EPA began to issue technology-based standards for municipal and industrial sources. Municipal sewage treatment plants (POTW) are required to meet secondary treatment standards. Effluent guidelines (for existing sources) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) are issued for categories of industrial facilities discharging directly to surface waters. Categorical Pretreatment Standards are issued to industrial users (also called ""indirect dischargers"") contributing wastes to POTW. These standards are developed in conjunction with the effluent guidelines program. As with effluent guidelines and NSPS, pretreatment standards consists of Pretreatment Standards for Existing Sources (PSES) and Pretreatment Standards for New Sources (PSNS)."
 Major statutory provisions , Technology-Based Standards Program ,"There are 28 categories with pretreatment standards as of 2020.As of 2020 the effluent guidelines and categorical pretreatment standards regulations have been published for 59 categories and apply to approximately 40,000 facilities that discharge directly to the nation's waters, 129,000 facilities that discharge to POTWs, and construction sites. These regulations are responsible for preventing the discharge of almost 700 billion pounds of pollutants each year. EPA has updated some categories since their initial promulgation and has added new categories.The secondary treatment standards for POTWs and the effluent guidelines are implemented through NPDES permits."
 Major statutory provisions , Technology-Based Standards Program ,(See Title IV.) The categorical pretreatment standards are typically implemented by POTWs through permits that they issue to their industrial users.
 Major statutory provisions , Water Quality Standards Program ,"The CWA requires states to monitor their water bodies and establish Water Quality Standards for them. Water Quality Standards (WQS) are risk-based requirements which set site-specific allowable pollutant levels for individual water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, streams and wetlands. States set WQS by designating uses for the water body (e.g., recreation, water supply, aquatic life, agriculture) and applying water quality criteria (numeric pollutant concentrations and narrative requirements) to protect the designated uses."
 Major statutory provisions , Water Quality Standards Program ,"An antidegradation policy is also issued by each state to maintain and protect existing uses and high quality waters.If a state fails to issue WQS, EPA is required to issue standards for that state.Water bodies that do not meet applicable water quality standards with technology-based controls alone are placed on the section 303(d) list of water bodies not meeting standards. Water bodies on the 303(d) list require development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). A TMDL is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet WQS."
 Major statutory provisions , Water Quality Standards Program ,"The TMDL is determined after study of the specific properties of the water body and the pollutant sources that contribute to the non-compliant status. Generally, the TMDL determines load based on a Waste Load Allocation (WLA), Load Allocation (LA), and Margin of Safety (MOS) Once the TMDL assessment is completed and the maximum pollutant loading capacity defined, an implementation plan is developed that outlines the measures needed to reduce pollutant loading to the non-compliant water body, and bring it into compliance. Over 60,000 TMDLs are proposed or in development for U.S. waters in the next decade and a half."
 Major statutory provisions , Water Quality Standards Program ,"Following the issuance of a TMDL for a water body, implementation of the requirements involves modification to NPDES permits for facilities discharging to the water body to meet the WLA allocated to the water body (see Title IV). The development of WQS and TMDL is a complex process, both scientifically and legally, and it is a resource-intensive process for state agencies. More than half of U.S. stream and river miles continue to violate water quality standards."
 Major statutory provisions , Water Quality Standards Program ,"Surveys of lakes, ponds and reservoirs indicated that about 70 percent were impaired (measured on a surface area basis), and a little more than 70 percent of the nation's coastlines, and 90 percent of the surveyed ocean and near coastal areas were also impaired."
 Major statutory provisions , National Water Quality Inventory ,"The primary mode of informing the quality of water of rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, estuaries, coastal waters and wetlands of the U.S. is through the National Water Quality Inventory Report. Water quality assessments are conducted pursuant to water quality standards adopted by states and other jurisdictions (territories, interstate commissions and tribes). The report is conveyed to Congress as a means to inform Congress and the public of compliance with quality standards established by states, territories and tribes."
 Major statutory provisions , National Water Quality Inventory ,"The assessments identify water quality problems within the states and jurisdictions, list the impaired and threatened water bodies, and identify non-point sources that contribute to poor water quality. Every two years states must submit reports that describe water quality conditions to EPA with a complete inquiry of social and economic costs and benefits of achieving goals of the Act."
 Major statutory provisions , Enforcement ,"Under section 309, EPA can issue administrative orders against violators, and seek civil or criminal penalties when necessary. For a first offense of criminal negligence, the minimum fine is $2,500, with a maximum of $25,000 fine per day of violation. A violator may also receive up to a year in jail. On a second offense, a maximum fine of $50,000 per day may be issued. For a knowing endangerment violation, i.e."
 Major statutory provisions , Enforcement ,"placing another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, a fine may be issued up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment up to 15 years for an individual, or up to $1,000,000 for an organization.States that are authorized by EPA to administer the NPDES program must have authority to enforce permit requirements under their respective state laws."
 Major statutory provisions , Federal facilities ,"Military bases, national parks and other federal facilities must comply with CWA provisions."
 Major statutory provisions , Thermal pollution ,"Section 316 requires standards for thermal pollution discharges, as well as standards for cooling water intake structures (e.g., fish screens). These standards are applicable to power plants and other industrial facilities."
 Major statutory provisions , Nonpoint Source Management Program ,"The 1987 amendments created the Nonpoint Source Management Program under CWA section 319. This program provides grants to states, territories and Indian tribes to support demonstration projects, technology transfer, education, training, technical assistance and related activities designed to reduce nonpoint source pollution. Grant funding for the program averaged $210 million annually for Fiscal Years 2004 through 2008."
 Major statutory provisions , Military vessels ,"Congress amended the CWA in 1996 to require development of Uniform National Discharge Standards (""UNDS"") for military vessels. EPA and the Department of Defense published standards in 2017 and 2020."
 Major statutory provisions , State certification of compliance ,States are required to certify that discharges authorized by federal permits will not violate the state's water quality standards.
 Major statutory provisions , NPDES permits for point sources ,"The NPDES permits program is authorized by CWA section 402. The initial permits issued in the 1970s and early 1980s focused on POTWs and industrial wastewater—typically ""process"" wastewater and cooling water where applicable, and in some cases, industrial stormwater. The 1987 WQA expanded the program to cover stormwater discharges explicitly, both from municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4) and industrial sources."
 Major statutory provisions , NPDES permits for point sources ,"The MS4 NPDES permits require regulated municipalities to use Best Management Practices to reduce pollutants to the ""Maximum Extent Practicable."" MS4s serve over 80% of the US population and provide drainage for 4% of the land area.POTWs with combined sewers are required to comply with the national Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy, published by EPA in 1994. The policy requires municipalities to make improvements to reduce or eliminate overflow-related pollution problems. About 860 communities in the US have combined sewer systems, serving about 40 million people.Non-stormwater permits typically include numeric effluent limitations for specific pollutants."
 Major statutory provisions , NPDES permits for point sources ,"A numeric limitation quantifies the maximum pollutant load or concentration allowed in the discharge, e.g., 30 mg/L of biochemical oxygen demand. Exceeding a numeric limitation constitutes a violation of the permit, and the discharger is subject to fines as laid out in section 309. Facilities must periodically monitor their effluent (i.e., collect and analyze wastewater samples), and submit Discharge Monitoring Reports to the appropriate agency, to demonstrate compliance. Stormwater permits typically require facilities to prepare a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and implement best management practices, but do not specify numeric effluent limits and may not include regular monitoring requirements."
 Major statutory provisions , NPDES permits for point sources ,"Some permits cover both stormwater and non-stormwater discharges. NPDES permits must be reissued every five years. Permit agencies (EPA, states, tribes) must provide notice to the public of pending permits and provide an opportunity for public comment.In 2012, EPA estimated that there are over 500,000 stormwater permittees. This number includes permanent facilities such as municipal (POTW, MS4) and industrial plants; and construction sites, which are temporary stormwater dischargers."
 Major statutory provisions , Dredge and fill permits ,"Section 404 requires that a discharger of dredged or fill material obtain a permit, unless the activity is eligible for an exemption. Essentially, all discharges affecting the bottom elevation of a jurisdictional water body require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). These permits are an essential part of protecting streams and wetlands, which are often filled by land developers. Wetlands are vital to the ecosystem in filtering streams and rivers and providing habitat for wildlife.There are two main types of wetlands permits: general permits and individual permits."
 Major statutory provisions , Dredge and fill permits ,"General permits change periodically and cover broad categories of activities, and require the permittee to comply with all stated conditions. General permits (such as the ""Nationwide Permits"") are issued for fill activities that will result in minimal adverse effects to the environment. Individual permits are utilized for actions that are not addressed by a general permit, or that do not meet the conditions of a General Permit. In addition, individual permits typically require more analysis than do the general permits, and usually require much more time to prepare the application and to process the permit."
 Major statutory provisions , Dredge and fill permits ,"When the USACE processes an application for an Individual Permit, it must issue a public notice describing the proposed action described in the permit application. Although the Corps District Engineer makes the decision to grant a permit, the EPA Administrator may veto a permit if it is not reasonable. Before making such a decision, however, EPA must consult with the USACE. A USACE permit typically expires after five years. Mountaintop removal mining requires a section 404 permit when soil and rock from the mining operation is placed in streams and wetlands (commonly called a ""valley fill"")."
 Major statutory provisions , Dredge and fill permits ,Pollutant discharges from valley fills to streams also requires an NPDES permit.
 Major statutory provisions , Exemptions ,"After passage of the CWA in 1972, a controversy arose as to the application of section 404 to agriculture and certain other activities. The Act was interpreted by some to place restrictions on virtually all placement of dredged materials in wetlands and other waters of the United States, raising concern that the federal government was about to place all agricultural activities under the jurisdiction of USACE."
 Major statutory provisions , Exemptions ,"For opponents of the Act, section 404 had, as a result of this concern, become a symbol of dramatic over-regulation.: 901–903 When Congress considered the 1977 CWA Amendments, a significant issue was to ensure that certain agricultural activities and other selected activities, could continue without the government's supervision—in other words, completely outside the regulatory or permit jurisdiction of any federal agency. The 1977 amendments included a set of six section 404 exemptions. For example, totally new activities such as construction of farm roads, Sec. 1344(f)(1)(E), construction of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches, and minor agricultural drainage, Sec."
 Major statutory provisions , Exemptions ,"1344(f)(1)(A), all are exempted by Statute. Section 1344(f)(1)(C), which exempts discharge of dredged material “for the purpose of... the maintenance of drainage ditches.” All of these exemptions were envisioned to be self-executing, that is not technically requiring an administrative no-jurisdiction determination."
 Major statutory provisions , Exemptions ,"One such example was the maintenance of agricultural drainage ditches.: 906 Throughout the hearing process, Congressmen of every environmental persuasion repeatedly stated that the over $5 Billion invested in drainage facilities could be maintained without government regulation of any kind.: 906–912 Senator Edmund Muskie, for example, explained that exempt activities such as agricultural drainage would be entirely unregulated.: 949 Other exemptions were granted as well, including exemptions for normal farming activities."
 Major statutory provisions , Importance of no-jurisdiction determinations ,"Although Congress envisioned a set of self-executing exemptions, it has become common for landowners to seek no-jurisdiction determinations from the USACE. A landowner who intends to make substantial investments in acquisition or improvement of land might lawfully proceed with exempt activity, a permit not being required. The problem is that if the landowner's assumptions were incorrect and the activity later determined not to be exempt, the USACE will issue a cease and desist order. Obtaining an advanced ruling provides some level of comfort that the activities will have been deemed conducted in good faith."
 Major statutory provisions , Recapture of exemptions ,"Because some of the six exemptions involved new activities, such as minor drainage and silviculture (the clearing of forests by the timber industry), Congress recognized the need to impose some limitations on exemptions. Consequently, Congress placed the so-called recapture clause limitation on these new project exemptions."

 Major statutory provisions , Recapture of exemptions ,"A discharge of dredge or fill material in the navigable waters of the United States; The discharge is incidental to an activity having as its purpose the bringing of an area of navigable waters into a use to which it was not previously subject, and Where the flow or circulation of navigable waters may be impaired or the reach of such waters may be reduced.To remove the exemption, all of these requirements must be fulfilled—the discharge, the project purpose of bringing an area into a use to which it was not previously subject, and the impairment or reduction of navigable waters."
 Major statutory provisions , POTW Biosolids Management Program ,"The 1987 WQA created a program for management of biosolids (sludge) generated by POTWs. The Act instructed EPA to develop guidelines for usage and disposal of sewage sludge or biosolids. The EPA regulations: (1) Identify uses for sewage sludge, including disposal; (2) Specify factors to be taken into account in determining the measures and practices applicable to each such use or disposal (including publication of information on costs); and (3) Identify concentrations of pollutants which interfere with each such use or disposal."
 Major statutory provisions , POTW Biosolids Management Program ,"EPA created an Intra-Agency Sludge Task Force to aid in developing comprehensive sludge regulations that are designed to do the following: (1) Conduct a multimedia examination of sewage sludge management, focusing on sewage sludge generated by POTWs; and (2) develop a cohesive Agency policy on sewage sludge management, designed to guide the Agency in implementing sewage sludge regulatory and management programs.The term biosolids is used to differentiate treated sewage sludge that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages of sewage sludge consist of, application of sludge to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content."
 Major statutory provisions , POTW Biosolids Management Program ,"Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse of sewage sludge is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 Beneficial Reuse Policy and the 1991 Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use of Sewage Sludge, with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage sludge contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms."
 Major statutory provisions , POTW Biosolids Management Program ,"Sludge also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing sewage sludge from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of sludge on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage sludge use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial."
 Major statutory provisions , POTW Biosolids Management Program ,"Opposing benefits of sludge water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, organic chemical content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. Sludge treatment processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying sludge to land as well as distributing and marketing it."
 Major statutory provisions , POTW Biosolids Management Program ,"Pollutants of sewage sludge come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides.The quality of sewage sludge is controlled under section 405(d), where limitations are set with methods of use or disposal for pollutants in sludge. EPA, under section 405(d)(3), established a containment approach to limit pollutants instead of numerical limitations. This methodology is more reasonable than numerical limitations and includes design standards, equipment standards, management practice, and operational standards or combination of these."
 Major statutory provisions , POTW Biosolids Management Program ,"Limits on sewage sludge quality allows treatment works that generate less contaminated pollutants and those that do not meet the sludge quality standards for use and disposal practice must clean up influent, improve sewage sludge treatment and/or select another use of disposal method. EPA has set standards for appropriate practices of use and disposal of biosolids in order to protect public health and the environment, but choice of use or disposal practices are reserved to local communities."
 Major statutory provisions , POTW Biosolids Management Program ,"Listed under section 405(e) of CWA, local communities are encouraged to use their sewage sludge for its beneficial properties instead of disposing it.Standards are set for sewage sludge generated or treated by publicly owned and privately owned treatment works that treat domestic sewage and municipal wastewater. Materials flushed in household drains through sinks, toilets and tubs are referred to as domestic wastewater and include components of soaps, shampoos, human excrement, tissues, food particles, pesticides, hazardous waste, oil and grease. These domestic wastewaters are treated at the source in septic tanks, cesspools, portable toilets, or in publicly/privately owned wastewater treatment works."
 Major statutory provisions , POTW Biosolids Management Program ,"Alternately, municipal wastewater treatments consist of more levels of treatment that provide greater wastewater cleanup with larger amounts of sewage sludge. Primary municipal treatment remove solids that settle at the bottom, generating more than 3,000 liters of sludge per million liters of wastewater that is treated. Primary sludge water content is easily reduced by thickening or removing water and contains up to 7% solids. Secondary municipal treatment process produces sewage sludge that is generated by biological treatment processes that include activated sludge systems, trickling filters, and other attached growth systems."
 Major statutory provisions , POTW Biosolids Management Program ,"Microbes are used to break down and convert organic substances in wastewater to microbial residue in biological treatment processes. This process removes up to 90% of organic matter and produces sludge that contains up to 2% solids and has increased generated volumes of sludge. Methods of use and disposal of sewage sludge include the following: Application of sludge to agricultural and non-agricultural lands; sale or give-away of sludge for use in home gardens; disposal of sludge in municipal landfills, sludge-only landfills, surface disposal sites and incineration of sludge."
 Major statutory provisions , POTW Biosolids Management Program ,"Managing quality of sewage sludge not only involves wastewater reduction and separation of contaminated waste from non-contaminants but also pretreatment of non-domestic wastewater. If pretreatment does not sufficiently reduce pollutant levels, communities have to dispose rather than use sludge."
 Major statutory provisions , Citizen suits ,"Any U.S. citizen may file a citizen suit against any person who has allegedly violated an effluent standard or limitation (i.e., a provision in an NPDES permit) or against the EPA Administrator if the Administrator failed to perform any non-discretionary act or duty required by the CWA."
 Major statutory provisions , Employee protection ,"The CWA includes an employee (""whistleblower"") protection provision. Employees in the U.S. who believe they were fired or suffered adverse action related to enforcement of the CWA may file a written complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration."
 Major statutory provisions , Title VI - State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds ,"The Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) program was authorized by the 1987 WQA. This replaced the municipal construction grants program, which was authorized in the 1972 law under Title II. In the CWSRF, federal funds are provided to the states and Puerto Rico to capitalize their respective revolving funds, which are used to provide financial assistance (loans or grants) to local governments for wastewater treatment, nonpoint source pollution control and estuary protection.The fund provides loans to municipalities at lower-than-market rates. The program's average interest rate was 1.4 percent nationwide in 2017, compared to an average market rate of 3.5 percent."
 Major statutory provisions , Title VI - State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds ,"In 2017, CWSRF assistance totaling $7.4 billion was provided to 1,484 local projects across the country."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"In May 2015 USACE and EPA published a new rule on the definition of ""waters of the United States"" (""WOTUS"") and the future enforcement of the act. Thirteen states sued, and on August 27 U.S. Chief District Judge for North Dakota Ralph R. Erickson issued a preliminary injunction blocking the regulation in those states. In a separate lawsuit, on October 9 a divided Sixth Circuit appeals court stayed the rule's application nationwide."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"Congress then passed a joint resolution under the Congressional Review Act overturning the WOTUS rule, but President Barack Obama vetoed the measure.On February 28, 2017, President Donald Trump signed documents directing EPA and USACE to review and rewrite the Obama administration's ""Clean Water Rule,"" which would clarify the WOTUS definition. The agencies were ordered to reassess the rule consistent with promoting economic growth and minimizing regulatory uncertainty.The Sixth Circuit appeals court stay was overturned on January 22, 2018, when the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that challenges to the 2015 rule must be filed in United States district courts."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"EPA then formally suspended the 2015 regulation and announced plans to issue a new version later in 2018. The Trump administration formally repealed the WOTUS rule on October 22, 2019 and published a replacement rule on April 21, 2020. On August 30, 2021, the United States District Court for the District of Arizona threw out the 2020 replacement rule.Under the administration of President Joe Biden, USACE and EPA published a revised definition of WOTUS on January 18, 2023, restoring the pre-2015 regulations on the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterways, effective March 20, 2023."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"However, on May 25, 2023, the restored WOTUS regulation would again be eliminated after the Supreme Court ruled in the second Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency case that the Clean Water Act's regulation authority of waters in the United States was limited to wetlands and waters ""with a continuous surface connection"" to larger bodies of water and that the law could not allow the EPA to regulate water which has been isolated from these larger bodies of water. During the 1880s and 1890s, Congress directed USACE to prevent dumping and filling in the nation's harbors, and the program was vigorously enforced."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"Congress first addressed water pollution issues in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, giving the Corps the authority to regulate most kinds of obstructions to navigation, including hazards resulting from effluents. Portions of this law remain in effect, including Section 13, the so-called Refuse Act. In 1910, USACE used the act to object to a proposed sewer in New York City, but a court ruled that pollution control was a matter left to the states alone. Speaking to the 1911 National Rivers and Harbors Congress, the chief of the Corps, William H."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"Bixby, suggested that modern treatment facilities and prohibitions on dumping ""should either be made compulsory or at least encouraged everywhere in the United States."" Most legal analysts have concluded that the 1899 law did not address environmental impacts from pollution, such as sewage or industrial discharges."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"However, there were several pollution enforcement cases in the 1960s and 1970s where the law was cited for broader pollution control objectives.Some sections of the 1899 act have been superseded by various amendments, including the 1972 CWA, while other notable legislative predecessors include: Public Health Service Act of 1912 expanded the mission of the United States Public Health Service to study problems of sanitation, sewage and pollution. Oil Pollution Act of 1924 prohibited the intentional discharge of fuel oil into tidal waters and provided authorization for USACE to apprehend violators."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"This was repealed by the 1972 CWA, reducing the Corps' role in pollution control to the discharge of dredged or fill material. Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 created a comprehensive set of water quality programs that also provided some financing for state and local governments. Enforcement was limited to interstate waters. The Public Health Service provided financial and technical assistance."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"Water Quality Act of 1965 required states to issue water quality standards for interstate waters, and authorized the newly created Federal Water Pollution Control Administration to set standards where states failed to do so.When EPA first opened its doors in 1970, the agency had weak authority to protect U.S. waters, lacking the legal power to write effluent guidelines and possessing only general authority to require secondary treatment from industrial dischargers.The 1969 burning Cuyahoga River had sparked national outrage; the Act grew out of it. In December 1970 a federal grand jury investigation led by U.S."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"Attorney Robert Jones (Ohio lawyer) began, of water pollution allegedly being caused by about 12 companies in northeastern Ohio. It was the first grand jury investigation of water pollution in the area. The Attorney General of the United States, John N. Mitchell, gave a Press Conference December 18, 1970 referencing new pollution control litigation, with particular reference to work with the new Environmental Protection Agency, and announcing the filing of a lawsuit that morning against the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation for discharging substantial quantities of cyanide into the Cuyahoga River near Cleveland."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"It was largely based on these and other litigation experiences that criteria for new legislation were identified. United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc. (1985). The Supreme Court upheld the Act's coverage in regulating wetlands that intermingle with navigable waters. This ruling was revised by the 2006 Rapanos decision. Edward Hanousek, Jr v. United States (9th Cir. Court of Appeals, 1996; certiorari denied, 2000). In 1994, during rock removal operations, a backhoe operator accidentally struck a petroleum pipeline near the railroad tracks."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"The operator's mistake caused the pipeline to rupture and spill between 1,000 and 5,000 gallons of heating oil into the Skagway river. Despite not being present at the scene during operations White Pass and Yukon Route Roadmaster Edward Hanousek, Jr. and President Paul Taylor were both held responsible for the spill and convicted. Solid Waste Agency of North Cook County (SWANCC) v. United States Army Corps of Engineers (2001), possibly denying the CWA's hold in isolated intrastate waters and certainly denying the validity of the 1986 ""Migratory Bird Rule."" S. D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Env. Protection (2006)."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"The Court ruled that section 401 state certification requirements apply to hydroelectric dams, which are federally licensed, where the dams cause a discharge into navigable waters. Rapanos v. United States (2006). The Supreme Court questioned federal jurisdiction as it attempted to define the Act's use of the terms ""navigable waters"" and ""waters of the United States."" The Court rejected the position of the USACE that its authority over water was essentially limitless."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"Though the case resulted in no binding case law, the Court suggested a narrowing of federal jurisdiction and implied the federal government needed a more substantial link between navigable federal waters and wetlands than it had been using, but held onto the ""significant nexus"" test. Northwest Environmental Advocates et al. v. EPA (9th Cir. Court of Appeals, 2008). Vessel discharges are subject to NPDES permit requirements. See Ballast water regulation in the United States. National Cotton Council v. EPA (6th Cir. Court of Appeals, 2009)."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"Point source discharges of biological pesticides, and chemical pesticides that leave a residue, into waters of the U.S. are subject to NPDES permit requirements. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co. 578 U.S. __ (2016), 8-0 ruling that a jurisdictional determination by the Army Corps of Engineers that land contains ""waters of the United States"" is a ""final agency action"", which is reviewable by the courts. This allows landowners to sue in court if the Army Corps of Engineers determines that the land contains waters of the United States (and therefore falls under the Clean Water Act). County of Maui v."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"Hawaii Wildlife Fund 590 U.S. __ (2020), a 6–3 ruling that a NPDES permit is required for point sources (as established in the statute) or for non-point sources that are ""functionally equivalent"" to direct discharge, such as in the specific case, wastewater discharged into injection wells that eventually reach the ocean, a navigable waterway. To date, the water quality goals stated by Congress in the 1972 act have not been achieved by American society: ""to make all U.S."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"waters fishable and swimmable by 1983;"" ""to have zero water pollution discharge by 1985;"" ""to prohibit discharge of toxic amounts of toxic pollutants"".: 1 More than half of U.S. stream and river miles, about 70 percent of lakes, ponds and reservoirs, and 90 percent of the surveyed ocean and near coastal areas continue to violate water quality standards. The reasons for the impairment vary by location; major sources are agriculture, industry and communities (typically through urban runoff)."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"Some of these pollution sources are difficult to control through national regulatory programs.However, since the passage of the 1972 act, the levels of pollution in the United States have experienced a dramatic decrease. The law has resulted in much cleaner waterways than before the bill was passed. Agriculture, industry, communities and other sources continue to discharge waste into surface waters nationwide, and many of these waters are drinking water sources. In many watersheds nutrient pollution (excess nitrogen and phosphorus) has become a major problem."
 Recent developments , Waters of the United States ,"It is argued in a 2008 paper that the Clean Water Act has made extremely positive contributions to the environment, but is in desperate need of reform to address the pollution problems that remain. A 2015 paper acknowledges that the CWA has been effective in controlling point sources, but that it has not effective with nonpoint sources, and argues that the law must be updated to address the nation's current water quality problems.A 2017 working paper finds that ""most types of water pollution declined over the period 1962-2001, though the rate of decrease slowed over time..."

 Effects , General Background ,"Water Quality: A Half Century of Progress, a report by the EPA Alumni Association"
 Background ,,"More than 46,000 commercial vessels — tankers, bulk carriers, container ships, barges, and passenger ships — travel the oceans and other waters of the world, carrying cargo and passengers for commerce, transport, and recreation. Their activities are regulated and scrutinized in a number of respects by international protocols and U.S. domestic laws, including those designed to protect against discharges of pollutants that could harm marine resources, other parts of the ambient environment, and human health."
 Background ,,"However, there are overlaps of some requirements, gaps in other areas, geographic differences in jurisdiction based on differing definitions, and questions about the adequacy of enforcement.Public attention to the environmental impacts of the maritime industry has been especially focused on the cruise industry, in part because its ships are highly visible and in part because of the industry's desire to promote a positive image. It represents a relatively small fraction of the entire shipping industry worldwide. As of January 2008, passenger ships (which include cruise ships and ferries) composed about 12% of the world shipping fleet."
 Background ,,"The cruise industry is a significant and growing contributor to the U.S. economy, providing more than $32 billion in total benefits annually and generating more than 330,000 U.S. jobs, but also making the environmental impacts of its activities an issue to many. Since 1980, the average annual growth rate in the number of cruise passengers worldwide has been 8.4%, and in 2005, cruises hosted an estimated 11.5 million passengers. Cruises are especially popular in the United States. In 2005, U.S. ports handled 8.6 million cruise embarcations (75% of global passengers), 6.3% more than in 2004."
 Background ,,"The worldwide cruise ship fleet consists of more than 230 ships, and the majority are foreign-flagged, with Liberia and Panama being the most popular flag countries. Foreign-flag cruise vessels owned by six companies account for nearly 95% of passenger ships operating in U.S. waters. Each year, the industry adds new ships to the total fleet, vessels that are bigger, more elaborate and luxurious, and that carry larger numbers of passengers and crew. Over the past two decades, the average ship size has been increasing at the rate of roughly 90 feet (27 m) every five years."
 Background ,,"The average ship entering the market from 2008 to 2011 will be more than 1,050 feet (320 m) long and will weigh more than 130,000 tons.To the cruise ship industry, a key issue is demonstrating to the public that cruising is safe and healthy for passengers and the tourist communities that are visited by their ships. Cruise ships carrying several thousand passengers and crew have been compared to “floating cities,” in part because the volume of wastes produced and requiring disposal is greater than that of many small cities on land."
 Background ,,"During a typical one-week voyage, a large cruise ship (with 3,000 passengers and crew) is estimated to generate 210,000 US gallons (790,000 L) of sewage; 1 million US gallons (3,800 m3) of graywater (wastewater from sinks, showers, and laundries); more than 130 US gallons (490 L) of hazardous wastes; 8 tons of solid waste; and 25,000 US gallons (95 m3) of oily bilge water. Passengers can singlehandedly produce up to 7.7 pounds of waste in a single day aboard a cruise ship. Those wastes, if not properly treated and disposed of, can pose risks to human health, welfare, and the environment."
 Background ,,"Environmental advocates have raised concerns about the adequacy of existing laws for managing these wastes, and suggest that enforcement of existing laws is weak.A 2000 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report focused attention on problems of cruise vessel compliance with environmental requirements. GAO found that between 1993 and 1998, foreign-flag cruise ships were involved in 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters. A few of the cases included multiple illegal discharge incidents occurring over the six-year period."
 Background ,,"GAO reviewed three major waste streams (solids, hazardous chemicals, and oily bilge water) and concluded that 83% of the cases involved discharges of oil or oil-based products, the volumes of which ranged from a few drops to hundreds of gallons. The balance of the cases involved discharges of plastic or garbage. GAO judged that 72% of the illegal discharges were accidental, 15% were intentional, and 13% could not be determined."
 Background ,,"The 87 cruise ship cases represented 4% of the 2,400 illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag ships (including tankers, cargo ships and other commercial vessels, as well as cruise ships) confirmed during the six years studied by GAO. Although cruise ships operating in U.S. waters have been involved in a relatively small number of pollution cases, GAO said, several have been widely publicized and have led to criminal prosecutions and multimillion-dollar fines.In 2000, a coalition of 53 environmental advocacy groups petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to take regulatory action to address pollution by cruise ships."
 Background ,,"The petition was amended in 2000 to request that EPA also examine air pollution from cruise ships. The petition called for an investigation of wastewater, oil, and solid waste discharges from cruise ships. In response, EPA agreed to study cruise ship discharges and waste management approaches. As part of that effort, EPA issued a background document in 2000 with preliminary information and recommendations for further assessment through data collection and public information hearings. The agency released its final Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report in 2009."
 Background ,,"The report summarized findings of recent data collection activities, especially from cruise ships operating in Alaskan waters.Concurrently, litigation regarding the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program led to a 2008 decision by the Ninth Circuit Court, ruling that EPA could not exclude vessel discharges from NPDES requirements. Subsequently, EPA issued an initial Vessel General Permit (VGP) with an effective date of February 6, 2009. Cruise ships generate a number of waste streams that can result in discharges to the marine environment, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste."
 Background ,,"They also emit air pollutants to the air and water. These wastes, if not properly treated and disposed of, can be a significant source of pathogens, nutrients, and toxic substances with the potential to threaten human health and damage aquatic life. Cruise ships represent a small — although highly visible — portion of the entire international shipping industry, and the waste streams described here are not unique to cruise ships."
 Background ,,"However, particular types of wastes, such as sewage, graywater, and solid waste, may be of greater concern for cruise ships relative to other seagoing vessels, because of the large numbers of passengers and crew that cruise ships carry and the large volumes of wastes that they produce. Further, because cruise ships tend to concentrate their activities in specific coastal areas and visit the same ports repeatedly (especially Florida, California, New York City, Galveston, Seattle, and the waters of Alaska), their cumulative impact on a local scale could be significant, as can impacts of individual large-volume releases (either accidental or intentional)."
 Background ,,"MARPOL 73/78 is one of the most important treaties regulating pollution from ships. Six Annexes of the Convention cover the various sources of pollution from ships and provide an overarching framework for international objectives. In the U.S., the convention is implemented through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. Under the provisions of the convention, the United States can take direct enforcement action under U.S. laws against foreign-flagged ships when pollution discharge incidents occur within U.S. jurisdiction. When incidents occur outside U.S. jurisdiction or jurisdiction cannot be determined, the United States refers cases to flag states, in accordance with MARPOL."
 Background ,,"These procedures require substantial coordination between the Coast Guard, the State Department, and other flag states, and the response rate from flag states has been poor. In the United States, several federal agencies have some jurisdiction over cruise ships in U.S. waters, but no one agency is responsible for or coordinates all of the relevant government functions. The U.S. Coast Guard and EPA have principal regulatory and standard-setting responsibilities.Cruise ships that are 79 feet (24 m) in length or greater, are subject to the requirements of the EPA Vessel General Permit (VGP). The most recent VGP was published in 2013."
 Background ,,"EPA issued its Small Vessel General Permit (sVGP) for smaller cruise ships in 2014, however this permit only applied to ballast water. In 2018 Congress repealed the sVGP under the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (VIDA). As of 2021 small vessels are subject to the ballast water requirements of the VGP, Coast Guard regulations, and applicable state and local government requirements. On October 26, 2020, EPA published proposed VIDA implementation regulations.The Department of Justice prosecutes violations of federal laws."
 Background ,,"In addition, the Department of State represents the United States at meetings of the IMO and in international treaty negotiations and is responsible for pursuing foreign-flag violations. Other federal agencies have limited roles and responsibilities. For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, Department of Commerce) works with the Coast Guard and EPA to report on the effects of marine debris. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is responsible for ensuring quarantine inspection and disposal of food-contaminated garbage (these APHIS responsibilities are part of the Department of Homeland Security)."
 Background ,,"In some cases, states and localities have responsibilities as well."
 Federal laws and regulations , Sewage ,"Commercial vessels are required to obtain NPDES permits pursuant to Section 402 of the Clean Water Act. Section 312 of the Act prohibits the dumping of untreated or inadequately treated sewage from vessels into the navigable waters of the United States (defined in the act as within 3 miles (4.8 km) of shore). Cruise ships are subject to this prohibition. Commercial and recreational vessels with installed toilets are required to have marine sanitation devices, which are designed to prevent the discharge of untreated sewage. Beyond 3 miles (4.8 km), raw sewage can be discharged."
 Federal laws and regulations , Sewage ,"On some cruise ships, especially many of those that travel in Alaskan waters, sewage is treated using Advanced Wastewater Treatment (AWT) systems that generally provide improved screening, treatment, disinfection, and sludge processing as compared with traditional MSDs (marine sanitation devices). AWTs are believed to be very effective in removing pathogens, oxygen-demanding substances, suspended solids, oil and grease, and particulate metals from sewage, but only moderately effective in removing dissolved metals and nutrients (ammonia, nitrogen and phosphorus).States may also establish no-discharge zones (NDZs) for vessel sewage, under section 312."
 Federal laws and regulations , Sewage ,"A state may completely prohibit the discharge of both treated and untreated sewage from all vessels with installed toilets into some or all waters over which it has jurisdiction (up to 3 miles (4.8 km) from land). As of 2017, this designation has been used for 72 areas representing part or all of the waters of 26 states, including a number of inland states."
 Federal laws and regulations , Greywater ,"Graywater discharges from large cruise ships are regulated by the 2013 VGP.Pursuant to a state law in Alaska, greywater must be treated prior to discharge into that state's waters."
 Federal laws and regulations , Solid waste ,"Cruise ship discharges of solid waste are governed by two federal laws. Title I of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act makes it illegal to transport garbage from the United States for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters without a permit or to dump material from outside the U.S. into U.S. waters. Beyond U.S. waters, no MPRSA permit is required for a cruise ship to discharge solid waste."
 Federal laws and regulations , Solid waste ,"The routine discharge of effluent incidental to the propulsion of vessels is explicitly exempted from the definition of dumping in the MPRSA.28The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships prohibits the discharge of all garbage within 3 nautical miles (5.6 km) of shore, certain types of garbage within 12 nautical miles (22 km) offshore, and plastic anywhere. It applies to all vessels operating in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)."
 Federal laws and regulations , Hazardous waste ,"The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is the primary federal law that governs hazardous waste management. The owner or operator of a cruise ship may be a generator and/or a transporter of hazardous waste, and thus subject to RCRA rules. Issues that the cruise ship industry may face relating to RCRA include ensuring that hazardous waste is identified at the point at which it is considered generated; ensuring that parties are properly identified as generators, storers, treaters, or disposers; and determining the applicability of RCRA requirements to each."
 Federal laws and regulations , Hazardous waste ,"Hazardous waste generated onboard cruise ships are stored onboard until the wastes can be offloaded for recycling or disposal in accordance with RCRA.A range of activities on board cruise ships generate hazardous wastes and toxic substances that would ordinarily be presumed to be subject to RCRA. Cruise ships are potentially subject to RCRA requirements to the extent that chemicals used for operations such as ship maintenance and passenger services result in the generation of hazardous wastes. However, it is not entirely clear what regulations apply to the management and disposal of these wastes."
 Federal laws and regulations , Hazardous waste ,"RCRA rules that cover small-quantity generators (those that generate more than 100 kilograms but less than 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste per month) are less stringent than those for large-quantity generators (generating more than 1,000 kilograms per month), and it is unclear whether cruise ships are classified as large or small generators of hazardous waste."
 Federal laws and regulations , Hazardous waste ,"Moreover, some cruise companies argue that they generate less than 100 kilograms per month and therefore should be classified in a third category, as “conditionally exempt small-quantity generators,” a categorization that allows for less rigorous requirements for notification, recordkeeping, and the like.In addition to RCRA, hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships are subject to Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of hazardous substances in harmful quantities into or upon the navigable waters of the United States, adjoining shorelines, or into or upon the waters of the contiguous zone."
 Federal laws and regulations , Bilge water ,"Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, applies to cruise ships and prohibits discharge of oil or hazardous substances in harmful quantities into or upon U.S. navigable waters, or into or upon the waters of the contiguous zone, or which may affect natural resources in the U.S. EEZ (extending 200 miles (320 km) offshore). Coast Guard regulations prohibit discharge of oil within 12 miles (19 km) from shore, unless passed through a 15-ppm oil water separator, and unless the discharge does not cause a visible sheen."
 Federal laws and regulations , Bilge water ,"Beyond 12 miles (19 km), oil or oily mixtures can be discharged while a vessel is proceeding en route and if the oil content without dilution is less than 100 ppm. Vessels are required to maintain an Oil Record Book to record disposal of oily residues and discharges overboard or disposal of bilge water.In addition to Section 311 requirements, the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) implements MARPOL Annex I concerning oil pollution. APPS applies to all U.S."
 Federal laws and regulations , Bilge water ,"flagged ships anywhere in the world and to all foreign flagged vessels operating in the navigable waters of the United States, or while at a port under U.S. jurisdiction. To implement APPS, the Coast Guard has promulgated regulations prohibiting the discharge of oil or oily mixtures into the sea within 12 nautical miles (22 km) of the nearest land, except under limited conditions. However, because most cruise lines are foreign registered and because APPS only applies to foreign ships within U.S. navigable waters, the APPS regulations have limited applicability to cruise ship operations."
 Federal laws and regulations , Bilge water ,"In addition, most cruise lines have adopted policies that restrict discharges of machinery space waste within three miles (5 km) from shore."
 Federal laws and regulations , Cruise ship efforts to reduce pollution ,"Following the 2000 GAO report, twelve cruise ship companies that had violated pollution regulations implemented new environmental strategies during 2003 to 2008. Several cruise lines within this group and others who had not been cited for violations sought to ameliorate their pollution of marine waters. Some of these companies reduced their waste production by transferring over from single use plastic packaging to reusable plastic containers for food being prepared on board and cutlery being used on the pool decks. Princess Cruises and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line acknowledged the waste problem, and adopted reusable items to work towards a resolution."
 Federal laws and regulations , Cruise ship efforts to reduce pollution ,"Recycling programs have also been implemented, and, because of the use of compactors on ships, plastics and aluminum are condensed and made easily recyclable upon ships return to port. The United States alone gains upward of 18,000 pounds of recycled goods from these practices.Some cruise lines have also taken it upon themselves to reduce air pollution, by using alternative, cleaner energy sources which has positive implications for marine waters as well. Shorepower (cold ironing), battery power, fuel cells, and liquified natural gas (LNG) are among sources that are being explored."
 Federal laws and regulations , Cruise ship efforts to reduce pollution ,"Carnival Corporation is one example of a cruise liner that is currently pursuing cleaner energies. In 2016 Carnival announced that it had agreed to partner with Shell and utilize LNG to power its next two new ships. Liquefied natural gas, a fossil fuel, is a much cleaner source of energy than oil and also much less expensive, to the benefit of cruise companies. Transitioning away from oil will help cruise liners combat their problems with bilge pollution. Cruise ships efforts to reduce their waste, recycle, and find more renewable energies will help alleviate their current rate of pollution of marine waters."
 Federal laws and regulations , Cruise ship efforts to reduce pollution ,"Some large cruise shipping lines have violated regulations by illegally bypassing the onboard oily water separator and discharging untreated oily wastewater. These violations by means of a so-called ""magic pipe"" have been prosecuted and resulted in large fines. Ship employees may be prosecuted and subject to imprisonment and fines. In 2002 the Carnival Corporation pleaded guilty in United States District Court in Miami to criminal charges related to falsifying records of the oil-contaminated bilge water that six of its ships dumped into the sea from 1996 through 2001."
 Federal laws and regulations , Cruise ship efforts to reduce pollution ,"The Carnival Corporation was ordered to pay $18 million in fines and perform community service, received five years' probation and must submit to a court-supervised worldwide environmental-compliance program for each of its cruise ships.For dumping oily waste into the seas and attempted cover-up Princess Cruise Lines was fined $40 million in 2016. According to federal authorities, it was the ""largest-ever criminal penalty"" for intentional vessel pollution. Officials said that these practices began in 2005 and persisted until August 2013, when a newly hired engineer blew the whistle."
 Federal laws and regulations , Cruise ship efforts to reduce pollution ,"As part of its plea agreement, ships of the parent company Carnival Cruise lines were subjected to a court supervised environmental compliance plan for five years.For violation of the probation terms of 2016 Carnival and its Princess line were ordered to pay an additional $20 million penalty in 2019. The new violations included discharging plastic into waters in the Bahamas, falsifying records and interfering with court supervision.

 Case ,,"The residents of Woburn, Massachusetts sued Beatrice Foods, the operator of a tannery; Cryovac, a subsidiary of W. R. Grace and Company; and UniFirst, a laundry service, for dumping chemicals that contaminated nearby groundwater. The occurrence of a cancer cluster and other negative effects on health led to revelations of water polluted primarily with trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene."
 Case ,,"The first trial included contentious disputes over ""splitting"" the trial into separate liability and damages phases.The Court decided to let the jury decide first whether there was enough evidence to hold the defendants liable for the water contamination, and which defendants would be held responsible for any proven damages to the plaintiffs as a result of the contamination. This is called bifurcating the trial. If any of the defendants were determined by the jury to not be liable, then they would be dismissed from the second part of the trial to determine damages. W.R."
 Case ,,"Grace was found liable, and Beatrice was found not liable. Judge Walter Jay Skinner granted a motion for a mistrial put by W. R. Grace. Woburn residents then appealed that motion, along with Beatrice's not liable verdict. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial. The district court then found that a discovery error made by Beatrice impaired the plaintiffs' preparation process, but recommended that its earlier denial of motion for relief from judgment be sustained."
 Case ,,"On appeal, the circuit court judge held that: first, the district court did not abuse its discretion by its determination regarding pretrial discovery, namely, the district court had determined that the operator's failure to disclose a report during pretrial discovery did not warrant relief from judgment. Second, the judge held that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the operator's nondisclosure of a report was roughly equivalent to residents' improper continuation of prosecution of their claim, and thus that monetary sanctions should not be imposed upon either party."
 Case ,,"Finally, the judge found that the operator's nondisclosure of report did not constitute “fraud on the court” which would trigger entry of default. On 22 September 1986, W.R. Grace settled with the plaintiffs for an undisclosed amount of money. However, many sources report that it was around $8 million (equivalent to roughly $21 million in 2022). On January 28, 1987, W.R. Grace was indicted by a grand jury of lying to the EPA about its usage and disposal of toxic waste. Anderson Regional Transportation Center was later built on the site and named in memory of James R."

 General problem ,,"For a compound to be recognized as an emerging contaminant it has to meet at least two requirements: Adverse human health effects have been associated with a compound. There is an established relationship between the positive and negative effect(s) of the compound.Emerging contaminants are those which have not previously been detected through water quality analysis, or have been found in small concentrations with uncertainty as to their effects. The risk they pose to human or environmental health is not fully understood."
 General problem ,,"Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) can be broadly classed into several categories of chemicals such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, cyanotoxins, nanoparticles, and flame retardants, among others. However, these classifications are constantly changing as new contaminants (or effects) are discovered and emerging contaminants from past years become less of a priority. These contaminants can generally be categorized as truly ""new"" contaminants that have only recently been discovered and researched, contaminants that were known about but their environmental effects were not fully understood, or ""old"" contaminants that have new information arising regarding their risks."
 Contaminant classes , Pharmaceuticals ,"Pharmaceuticals are gaining more attention as CECs because of their continual introduction into the environment and their general lack of regulation. These compounds are often present at low concentrations in water bodies and little is currently known about their environmental and health effects from chronic exposure; pharmaceuticals are only now becoming a focus in toxicology due to improved analytical techniques that allow very low concentrations to be detected. There are several sources of pharmaceuticals in the environment, including most prominently effluent from sewage treatment plants, aquaculture and agricultural runoff."
 Contaminant classes , Cyanotoxins ,"The growth of cyanobacterial blooms has been increasing due to the eutrophication (or increase in nutrient levels) of surface waters around the world. The increase in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus has been linked to fertilizer runoff from agricultural fields and the use of products such as detergents in urban spaces. These blooms can release toxins that can decrease water quality and are a risk to human and wildlife health. Additionally, there is a lack of regulations regarding the maximum contaminant levels (MCL) allowed in drinking water sources."
 Contaminant classes , Cyanotoxins ,"Cyanotoxins can have both acute and chronic toxic effects, and there are often many consequences for the health of the environment where these occur as well."
 Contaminant classes , Industrial chemicals ,"Industrial chemicals from various industries are known to produce harmful chemicals that are known to cause harm to human health and the environment. Common industrial chemicals like 1,4-Dioxanes, Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are commonly found in various water sources. Due to the large differences in transportability of compounds, there is a great level of variance contaminant to contaminant between the location of contamination and the place of occurring hazards."
 Contaminant classes , Industrial chemicals ,"An example of the a contaminant which can have detected hazards at the point of origin is the effect of municipal solid waste on the environment through seepage and particulate pollution. On the other hand, the effects of water-soluble contaminants may be obscured a long time as they are washed far away from the contamination site and only slowly accumulate in oceans and groundwater to harmful concentrations."
 Adverse human health effects , Relation between compound and effects ,"There is an overlap of many anthropogenically sourced chemicals that humans are exposed to regularly. This makes it difficult to attribute negative health causality to a specific, isolated compound. EPA manages a Contaminant Candidate List to review substances that may need to be controlled in public water systems. EPA has also listed twelve contaminants of emerging concern at federal facilities, with ranging origins, health effects, and means of exposure. The twelve listed contaminants are as follows: Trichloropropane (TCP), Dioxane, Trinitrotoluene (TNT), Dinitrotoluene, Hexahydro-trinitro-triazane (RDX), N-nitroso-dimethylamine (NDMA), Perchlorate, Polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), Tungsten, Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and Nanomaterials."
 Adverse human health effects , Selected compounds listed as emerging contaminants ,"The NORMAN network enhances the exchange of information on emerging environmental substances. A Suspect List Exchange (SLE) has been created to allow sharing of the many potential contaminants of emerging concern. The list contains more than 100,000 chemicals. Table 1 is a summary of emerging contaminants currently listed on one EPA website and a review article. Detailed use and health risk of commonly identified CECs are listed in the table below. In the 19th and early 20th centuries asbestos was used in many products and in building construction, and was not considered a threat to human health or the environment."
 Adverse human health effects , Selected compounds listed as emerging contaminants ,"Deaths and lung problems caused by asbestos were first documented in the early 20th century. The first regulations of the asbestos industry were published in the UK in the 1930s. Regulation of asbestos in the US did not occur until the 1980s. In the 1970s there was a serious issue with the water treatment infrastructure of some US states, notably in Southern California with water sourced from the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta."
 Adverse human health effects , Selected compounds listed as emerging contaminants ,"Water was being disinfected for domestic use through chlorine treatment, which was effective for killing microbial contaminants and bacteria, but in some cases, it reacted with runoff chemicals and organic matter to form trihalomethanes (THMs). Research done in the subsequent years began to suggest the carcinogenic and harmful nature of this category of compounds. EPA issued its first standard for THMs, applicable to public water systems, in 1979, and more stringent standards in 1998 and 2006. Rapid industry changes also make the treatment and regulation of CECs particularly challenging."
 Adverse human health effects , Selected compounds listed as emerging contaminants ,"For instance, the replacing substance (GenX), for the recently regulated perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a PFAS, had a more detrimental environmental impact, resulting in the subsequently banning of GenX as well. Hence, there is a pressing need for the treatment and management of CECs to keep up with global trends. Emerging contaminants are most often addressed as an issue concerning water quality. The release of harmful compounds into the environment which find their way into municipal food, water, and homes have a negative externality on social welfare."
 Adverse human health effects , Selected compounds listed as emerging contaminants ,"These contaminants have the capability to travel far from the point-source of their pollution into the environment and accumulate over time to become harmful because they have been left unregulated by federal agencies. These harmful compounds cause damage to environmental and human health, and they are difficult to trace therefore it is challenging to establish who should foot the bill for the damage done by ECs. Because these contaminants were not detected or regulated in the past, existing treatment plants are ill-equipped to remove them from domestic water."
 Adverse human health effects , Selected compounds listed as emerging contaminants ,"There are sites with waste that would take hundreds of years to clean up and prevent further seepage and contamination into the water table and surrounding biosphere. In the United States, the environmental regulatory agencies on the federal level are primarily responsible for determining standards and statutes which guide policy and control in the state to prevent citizens and the environment from being exposed to harmful compounds. Emerging contaminants are examples of instances in which regulation did not do what it was supposed to, and communities have been left vulnerable to adverse health effects."
 Adverse human health effects , Selected compounds listed as emerging contaminants ,"Many states have assessed what can be done about emerging contaminants and currently view it as a serious issue, but only eight states have specific risk management programs addressing emerging contaminants. These are tactics and methods that aim to remediate the effects of certain, or all, CECs by preventing movement throughout the environment, or limiting their concentrations in certain environmental systems. It is particularly important to ensure that water treatment approaches do not simply move contaminants from effluent to sludge given the potential for sludge to be spread to land providing an alternative route to entering the environment."
 Solutions , Advanced treatment plant technology ,"For some emerging contaminants, several advanced technologies—sonolysis, photocatalysis, Fenton-based oxidation and ozonation—have treated pollutants in laboratory experiments. Another technology is ""enhanced coagulation"" in which the treatment entity would work to optimize filtration by removing precursors to contamination through treatment. In the case of THMs, this meant lowering the pH, increasing the feed rate of coagulants, and encouraging domestic systems to operate with activated carbon filters and apparatuses that can perform reverse osmosis."
 Solutions , Advanced treatment plant technology ,"Although these methods are effective, they are costly, and there have been many instances of treatment plants being resistant to pay for the removal of pollution, especially if it wasn't created in the water treatment process as many EC's occur from runoff, past pollution sources, and personal care products. It is also difficult to incentivize states to have their own policies surrounding contamination because it can be burdensome for states to pay for screening and prevention processes."
 Solutions , Advanced treatment plant technology ,"There is also an element of environmental injustice, in that lower income communities with less purchasing and political power cannot buy their own system for filtration, and are regularly exposed to harmful compounds in drinking water and food. However recent treads for Light-based systems shows great potential for such applications. With the decrease in cost of UV-LED systems and growing prevalence of solar powered systems, it shows great potential to remove CECs while keeping cost low."
 Solutions , Metal–organic framework-based nano-adsorbent remediation ,"Researchers have suggested that metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and MOF-based nano-adsorbents (MOF-NAs) could be used in the removal of certain CECs like pharmaceuticals and personal care products, especially in wastewater treatment. Widespread use of MOF-based nano-adsorbents has yet to be implemented due to complications created by the vast physicochemical properties that CECs contain. The removal of CECs largely depends on the structure and porosity of the MOF-NAs and the physicochemical compatibility of both the CECs and the MOF-NAs. If a CEC is not compatible with the MOF-NA, then particular functional groups can be chemically added to increase compatibility between the two molecules."
 Solutions , Metal–organic framework-based nano-adsorbent remediation ,"The addition of functional groups causes the reactions to rely on other chemical processes and mechanisms, such as hydrogen bonding, acid-base reactions, and complex electrostatic forces. MOF-based nano-adsorbent remediation heavily relies on water-qualities, such as pH, in order for the reaction to be executed efficiently. MOF-NA remediation can also be used to efficiently remove other heavy metals and organic compounds in wastewater treatment."
 Solutions , Membrane bioreactors ,"Another method of possible remediation for CECs is through the use of membrane bioreactors (MBRs) that act through mechanisms of sorption and biodegradation. Membrane bioreactors have shown results on being able to filter out certain solutes and chemicals from wastewater through methods of microfiltration, but due to the extremely small size of CECs, MBRs must rely on other mechanisms in order to ensure the removal of CECs. One mechanism that MBRs use to remove CECs from wastewater is sorption."
 Solutions , Membrane bioreactors ,"Sorption of the CECs to sludge deposits in the MBR's system can allow the deposits to sit and be bombarded with water, causing the eventual biodegradation of CECs in the membrane. Sorption of a particular CEC can be even more efficient in the system if the CEC is hydrophobic, causing it to move from the wastewater to the sludge deposits more quickly."
 Population characteristics ,,"In Los Angeles County, researchers found a higher risk in premature birth (10-20%) and low birth weight for infants whose mothers lived near high traffic areas Studies conducted on populations living near the 405 and 710 interstates in Southern California found their exposure to particulate vehicle emissions to be almost 25 times higher than for people living 1000 ft from the freeways. This research also concluded that particulate vehicle emissions are more toxic to children's health than other particles such as Carbon Monoxide and Nitrogen Dioxide"
 Dangers of vehicle emissions , Carbon monoxide ,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is directly released from motor vehicles engines, which are a major source of this pollutant in the LA Basin 5. CO inhaled by pregnant women may threaten the unborn child's growth and mental development."
 Dangers of vehicle emissions , Carbon monoxide ,"Because CO competes with Oxygen to achieve dispersion throughout the blood stream, fetal hypoxia (lack of oxygen) may result at high levels of maternal CO exposure, however the exact amount of exposure of CO to become a fetal threat is unknown High levels of carbon monoxide are also found in cigarettes, it is advised that pregnant women avoid smoking so as to not run the risk of affecting their child's growth or mental development. For further information on Carbon Monoxide and its effects on human health please see, Carbon monoxide poisoning."
 Dangers of vehicle emissions , Nitrogen oxides ,"Nitrogen oxides (NO) are common air pollutants found throughout most of the United States. You can be exposed to these oxides by breathing polluted air, which is most commonly found in areas with heavy motor vehicle traffic Exposure to high levels of Nitrogen oxides damages tissues of the throat and upper respiratory tract and can interfere with the body's ability to carry oxygen. High exposure to nitrogen dioxide may cause fetal mutations, damage a developing fetus, and decrease a woman's ability to become pregnant."
 Dangers of vehicle emissions , Nitrogen oxides ,Studies have also shown that higher exposures to NO inhibit embryo development during both traditional pregnancies and artificial inseminations
 Dangers of vehicle emissions , Particulate matter ,"Examples of particulate matter include ash from smoke in campfires, dust particles around your house, and smoke coming from car exhaust pipes; in areas close to freeways this is a problem. A study conducted on European women indicated that higher exposure to particulate matter during the initial first weeks of their pregnancy resulted in low birth weight babies This toxin is also considered to be the most dangerous of the three because it can be basically anything small enough to be inhaled. This may also be due to the fact that brain growth begins within the first month of conception."
 Dangers of vehicle emissions , Particulate matter ,"A previous study conducted in the Los Angeles Basin of Southern California reported a consistent association between levels of CO and particulate matter during the first trimester and the last six weeks prior to birth and risk of preterm birth. Prematurity in babies is accompanied by an array of health complications. Children born prematurely are at highest risk for developing Infant respiratory distress syndrome, gastrointestinal, and hematologic diseases, central nervous system (CNS) problems such as hearing loss, are more prone to infections, and at risk for hearing and vision loss."
 Dangers of vehicle emissions , Particulate matter ,"Babies born of low weight are also at risk for respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiac, CNS, infection and vision problems. These gestational issues persist until the adult years for most children and result in high blood pressure, Type II Diabetes, and other heart diseases. Prematurity and Low Birth Weight caused by air pollution also affects fetal brain development. This is of importance since lack of proper brain development will not allow a child's brain to form proper synapse connections which will negatively affect the child's speech, learning abilities, and social skills."
 Dangers of vehicle emissions , Particulate matter ,"Exposure to vehicle air pollutants has been noted as primary cause for infant mortality and morbidity, and is also argued to be a cause of chronic diseases such as asthma in child and adulthood"
 Long-term and short-term effects on babies , Asthma ,"The number of children affected by asthma has increased in past decades the point where it is now the most chronic illness in children and the most common cause of children hospitalizations in the U.S. causing it to also be a number one contributor to school absences Excessive school absences ultimately affect the child's learning ability, and decrease their time to socialize with kids their age. It is not uncommon for children who suffer from asthma to oftentimes repeat grades due to failure to keep up academically."
 Long-term and short-term effects on babies , Respiratory problems ,"Studies have found that children who are exposed to higher levels of car pollutants report higher respiratory problems including wheezing, ear and throat infections and have a higher incidence of physician-diagnosed asthma."
 Long-term and short-term effects on babies , Cancer ,"Children living in close proximity to high traffic areas are also eight times more likely to develop leukemia compared to children who do not This finding indicates that children who develop cancer as a result of traffic exposure will also spend more time in the hospital. This is not only a cause of school absences, but also a time of trauma for a child who is constantly visiting providers for treatment."
 Long-term and short-term effects on babies , Cancer ,Children with cancer have a harder time keeping up with school and keeping up with their friends Autism is a spectrum of disorders that range from a severe inability to communicate and some mental disabilities to milder symptoms such as attention disorders. Some claims exist that the incidence of autism is higher for babies whose mothers spend time in ‘high traffic pollution’ areas compared to mothers who spend their pregnancy in cleaner air.
 Long-term and short-term effects on babies , Cancer ,"In a recent study conducted by UCLA, air pollutant levels were measured for mothers who had children with autism and then compared to air pollutant levels in environments for mothers who had children without autism."
 Long-term and short-term effects on babies , Cancer ,This study found that babies who were exposed to higher levels of pollutants while in the womb had a 10% higher risk of autism than babies who had low levels of exposure; another finding from this study is that fine particulates had the strongest association with autism Environmental impact of transport List of most-polluted cities by particulate matter concentration Zero To Three - information on child brain development
 Early life ,,"Lois Marie Gibbs was born in a blue-collar area of Grand Island, New York. She had five siblings that she grew up with; her father worked in steel mills and her mother was a housewife. Gibbs did not have many hobbies and activities as a child. After she graduated high school, she married Harry Gibbs, a chemical worker. She had two children and moved to Love Canal. Lois Gibbs's involvement in environmental causes began in 1978, when she discovered that her 5-year-old son's elementary school in Niagara Falls, New York was built on a toxic waste dump."
 Early life ,,"She approached the School Board after worrying about the safety of her child, and they refused to take any action. Gibbs began speaking with other parents and in 1978, she started the Love Canal Parents Movement. After the creation of this movement, the New York State Department of Health stated that the school should be closed and that pregnant women and children living on these residences should leave."
 Early life ,,"The state then purchased homes close to the canal, which led to the Love Canal Homeowners Association (LCHA).Gibbs created a petition and reached out to the residents of her neighborhood by going door-to-door to gather support. Gibbs's efforts were centered on her role as a mother fighting to protect her children's health. She led her community in a battle against the local, state, and federal governments by presenting the signatures to the New York State Department of Health. After years of struggle, 833 families were eventually evacuated, and the cleanup of Love Canal began."
 Early life ,,"National press coverage made Lois Gibbs a household name. In addition, President Jimmy Carter mentioned Gibbs as the key grassroots leader in the Love Canal movement during 1980. Her efforts also led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or Superfund, which is used to locate and clean up toxic waste sites throughout the United States. In 1980, Gibbs formed the Citizens' Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste, later renamed the Center for Health, Environment and Justice (CHEJ) in 1998, where she currently serves as executive director."
 Early life ,,"CHEJ is a grassroots environmental crisis center that provides information, resources, technical assistance and training to community groups around the nation. CHEJ seeks to form strong local organizations in order to protect neighborhoods from exposure to hazardous wastes. Gibbs has authored several books about the Love Canal story and the effects of toxic waste. The earlier and most quoted is Love Canal. My story, written with Murray Levine and published in 1982. Her story was dramatized in the 1982 made-for-TV movie Lois Gibbs: the Love Canal Story, in which she was played by Marsha Mason."
 Early life ,,"Lois Gibbs is still in partnership with the Center for Health, Environment and Justice (CHEJ). She has moved her point of activism to fracking, which she has published articles in The Huffington Post about. She bases the value of this article on putting families and earth first. She is currently working with a group in Pennsylvania in order to gain more support on keeping the ground and water clean."

 Background ,,"The Line 3 pipeline was built by the Lakehead Pipeline Company (now Enbridge) in the 1960s. The 34"" wide, 1031-mile pipeline transports crude oil from Hardisty, Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin. The pipeline was not tested for flaws in its entirety until after 1976.From the 1970s until the 1991 spill, the Line 3 pipeline suffered 24 leaks due to the same seam failure and was the source of 16 ""large oil spills"" resulting in four million gallons of oil spilled."
 Background ,,"Officials with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency estimated that a total of 5.7 million gallons had spilled from the Lakehead line since 1971. The Line 3 pipeline was also responsible for the second worst oil spill in Minnesota history, when 1.3 million gallons of crude spilled near Argyle, Minnesota in 1973. At the time of the 1991 spill, the pipeline carried 22 million gallons of oil every day. On the morning of March 3, 1991, an underground section of the Line 3 pipeline ruptured on a 16-acre wetland owned by Harry Hutchins."
 Background ,,"Following the rupture, a geyser of pressurized oil sprayed 30 to 40 feet in the air, coating aspen trees in the area. Within hours oil spread throughout the wetland area and over 340,000 gallons of oil from the spill flowed via a storm drain into the Prairie River, a tributary of the Mississippi River. At the time, the river had sheets of ice that were 18 inches thick, and an eight inch pool of crude oil formed on top of the ice towards the middle of the river. Oil also made its way under the ice."
 Background ,,"The Mississippi River was just two miles downstream from the spill.At 12:19 p.m., pipeline company operators in Edmonton, Alberta, noticed a massive drop in the line's pressure. Initially believing the pipeline's column of oil had become separated, they increased the pressure towards the end of the line. In a violation of company policy, they waited 71 minutes before shutting down the line after the drop in pressure. Two more hours passed before the company shut off valves to isolate the ruptured section of pipeline and prevent more oil from spilling."
 Background ,,"According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the delay in shutting down the pipeline resulted in a significant increase in the volume of oil that was spilled. Fish were killed where oil entered the water and the spill impacted marshes and vegetation on the riverbank.In total, 1.7 million gallons of crude spilled from the pipeline. It was the worst inland oil spill in the history of the United States. A resident in the Grand Rapids area contacted the fire department after noticing an odor near the river."
 Background ,,"Around 300 people living within a half mile of the spill were evacuated for their safety.Half a dozen government agencies responded to the disaster, including the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the Minnesota Department of Emergency Management, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Coast Guard. The pipeline company hired nearly 20 contractors from three states to attempt to clean up the spill. Oil was removed from the icy surface of the river using vacuum trucks. Squeegees were used to push oil across the ice to locations where it could be removed."
 Background ,,"Cleanup crews also used chainsaws to cut slots in the ice where booms could be used to absorb the oil. Contaminated blocks of ice were sprayed with hot water to wash out the oil.While the pipeline company initially said that only 630,000 gallons of oil were spilled, they later tripled the estimate and reported that two million gallons of oil-contaminated water and oil had been collected from the site. 29,400 gallons of oil were thought to have leaked into the soil. Much of it was burned after being dug up.Cleanup of the spill lasted for months."
 Background ,,"Pipeline representative Denise Hamsher said the company expected to spend $13 million on cleanup. As the Prairie River was still iced over, a larger disaster was averted. Had the oil spill occurred a month later when the ice had melted, hundreds of miles of the Mississippi River could have been affected. Following the Line 3 oil spill, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted a study of spill response management in the Mississippi River upstream of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. The study found that contamination of the river could create serious problems for the cities of St."

 History , Origins ,"Allan Loughead and his brother Malcolm Loughead had operated an earlier aircraft company, Loughead Aircraft Manufacturing Company, which was operational from 1912 to 1920. The company built and operated aircraft for paying passengers on sightseeing tours in California and had developed a prototype for the civil market, but folded in 1920 due to the flood of surplus aircraft deflating the market after World War I."
 History , Origins ,"Allan went into the real estate market while Malcolm had meanwhile formed a successful company marketing brake systems for automobiles.On December 13, 1926, Allan Lockheed, John Northrop, Kenneth Kay and Fred Keeler secured funding to form the Lockheed Aircraft Company in Hollywood (spelled phonetically to prevent mispronunciation). This new company utilized some of the same technology originally developed for the Model S-1 to design the Vega Model. In March 1928, the company relocated to Burbank, California, and by year's end reported sales exceeding one million dollars."
 History , Origins ,"From 1926 to 1928 the company produced over 80 aircraft and employed more than 300 workers who by April 1929 were building five aircraft per week. In July 1929, majority shareholder Fred Keeler sold 87% of the Lockheed Aircraft Company to Detroit Aircraft Corporation. In August 1929, Allan Loughead resigned.The Great Depression ruined the aircraft market, and Detroit Aircraft went bankrupt. A group of investors headed by brothers Robert and Courtland Gross, and Walter Varney, bought the company out of receivership in 1932. The syndicate bought the company for a mere $40,000 ($660,000 in 2011)."
 History , Origins ,"Ironically, Allan Loughead himself had planned to bid for his own company, but had raised only $50,000 ($824,000), which he felt was too small a sum for a serious bid.In 1934, Robert E. Gross was named chairman of the new company, the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, which was headquartered at what is now the airport in Burbank, California. His brother Courtlandt S. Gross was a co-founder and executive, succeeding Robert as chairman following his death in 1961. The company was named the Lockheed Corporation in 1977."
 History , Origins ,"The first successful construction that was built in any number (141 aircraft) was the Vega first built in 1927, best known for its several first- and record-setting flights by, among others, Amelia Earhart, Wiley Post, and George Hubert Wilkins. In the 1930s, Lockheed spent $139,400 ($2.29 million) to develop the Model 10 Electra, a small twin-engined transport. The company sold 40 in the first year of production. Amelia Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, flew it in their failed attempt to circumnavigate the world in 1937."
 History , Origins ,"Subsequent designs, the Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior and the Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra expanded their market."
 History , Prewar production ,"The Lockheed Model 14 formed the basis for the Hudson bomber, which was supplied to both the British Royal Air Force and the United States military before and during World War II. Its primary role was submarine hunting. The Model 14 Super Electra were sold abroad, and more than 100 were license-built in Japan for use by the Imperial Japanese Army."
 History , Production during World War II ,"At the beginning of World War II, Lockheed – under the guidance of Clarence (Kelly) Johnson, who is considered one of the best-known American aircraft designers – answered a specification for an interceptor by submitting the P-38 Lightning fighter aircraft, a twin-engined, twin-boom design. The P-38 was the only American fighter aircraft in production throughout American involvement in the war, from Pearl Harbor to Victory over Japan Day. It filled ground-attack, air-to-air, and even tactical bombing roles in all theaters of the war in which the United States operated."
 History , Production during World War II ,"The P-38 was responsible for shooting down more Japanese aircraft than any other U.S. Army Air Forces type during the war; it is particularly famous for being the aircraft type that shot down Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's airplane. The Lockheed Vega factory was located next to Burbank's Union Airport which it had purchased in 1940. During the war, the entire area was camouflaged in case of enemy reconnaissance. The factory was hidden beneath a huge burlap tarpaulin painted to depict a peaceful semi-rural neighborhood, replete with rubber automobiles."
 History , Production during World War II ,"Hundreds of fake trees, shrubs, buildings, and even fire hydrants were positioned to give a three-dimensional appearance. The trees and shrubs were created from chicken wire treated with an adhesive and covered with feathers to provide a leafy texture.Lockheed ranked tenth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. All told, Lockheed and its subsidiary Vega produced 19,278 aircraft during World War II, representing six percent of war production, including 2,600 Venturas, 2,750 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers (built under license from Boeing), 2,900 Hudson bombers, and 9,000 Lightnings."
 History , Postwar production ,"During World War II, Lockheed, in cooperation with Trans-World Airlines (TWA), had developed the L-049 Constellation, a radical new airliner capable of flying 43 passengers between New York and London at a speed of 300 mph (480 km/h) in 13 hours. Once the Constellation (nicknamed Connie) went into production, the military received the first production models; after the war, the airlines received their original orders, giving Lockheed more than a year's head-start over other aircraft manufacturers in what was easily foreseen as the post-war modernization of civilian air travel. The Constellations' performance set new standards which transformed the civilian transportation market."
 History , Postwar production ,"Its signature tri-tail was the result of many initial customers not having hangars tall enough for a conventional tail. Lockheed produced a larger transport, the double-decked R6V Constitution, which was intended to make the Constellation obsolete. However, the design proved underpowered. The company sought to purchase Convair in 1946, but the sale was blocked by the SEC."
 History , Skunk Works ,"In 1943, Lockheed began, in secrecy, development of a new jet fighter at its Burbank facility. This fighter, the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star, became the first American jet fighter to score a kill. It also recorded the first jet-to-jet aerial kill, downing a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 in Korea, although by this time the F-80 (as it was redesignated in June 1948) was already considered obsolete.Starting with the P-80, Lockheed's secret development work was conducted by its Advanced Development Division, more commonly known as the Skunk works. The name was taken from Al Capp's comic strip Li'l Abner."
 History , Skunk Works ,"This organization has become famous and spawned many successful Lockheed designs, including the U-2 (late 1950s), SR-71 Blackbird (1962) and F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter (1978). The Skunk Works often created high-quality designs in a short time and sometimes with limited resources."
 History , Projects during the Cold War ,"In 1954, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, a durable four-engined transport, flew for the first time. This type remains in production today. In 1956, Lockheed received a contract for the development of the Polaris Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM); it would be followed by the Poseidon and Trident nuclear missiles. Lockheed developed the F-104 Starfighter in the late 1950s, the world's first Mach 2 fighter jet. In the early 1960s, the company introduced the C-141 Starlifter four-engine jet transport. During the 1960s, Lockheed began development for two large aircraft: the C-5 Galaxy military transport and the L-1011 TriStar wide-body civil airliner."
 History , Projects during the Cold War ,"Both projects encountered delays and cost overruns. The C-5 was built to vague initial requirements and suffered from structural weaknesses, which Lockheed was forced to correct at its own expense. The TriStar competed for the same market as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10; delays in Rolls-Royce engine development caused the TriStar to fall behind the DC-10. The C-5 and L-1011 projects, the canceled U.S. Army AH-56 Cheyenne helicopter program, and embroiled shipbuilding contracts caused Lockheed to lose large sums of money during the 1970s."
 History , Loan guarantee ,"Drowning in debt, in 1971 Lockheed (then the largest US defense contractor) asked the US government for a loan guarantee, to avoid insolvency. Lockheed argued that a government bailout was necessary due to the company's value for U.S. national security. On May 13, 1971, the Richard Nixon administration sent a bill titled ""The Emergency Loan Guarantee Act"" to Congress requesting a $250 million loan guarantee for Lockheed and its L-1011 Tristar airbus program. The measure was hotly debated in the US Senate. The chief antagonist was Senator William Proxmire (D-Wis), the nemesis of Lockheed and its chairman, Daniel J. Haughton."
 History , Loan guarantee ,"Some of the debate in Congress developed over what conditions should be attached to the bailout. Senator Alan Cranston demanded that the management be forced to step down, lest it set a precedent rewarding wasteful spending."

 History , Loan guarantee ,"Penn Central railroad to that fate, and the fact that the airbus program at issue was commercial rather than military.Naval scholar Thomas Paul Stanton notes that the opposition to the bill held it was ""the beginning of the socialization of the American aircraft and aerospace industry."" Proponents responded by claiming ""this socializing process had taken place many years before"", and some witnesses before Congress discounted ""the very notion of 'free enterprise'."" Treasury Secretary Connally pointed to the faltering economy and worries about unemployment while testifying ""the time has come within the United States when we have to look at things differently."
 History , Loan guarantee ,"Free enterprise is just not all that free."" Questions arose whether letting Lockheed fail would be bad for the market due to decreased competition or good by screening out inefficient competitors and mismanagement. Lockheed's competitors, McDonnell Douglas and General Electric (collaborators on the DC-10) strongly opposed the bill and they feared the government would steer contracts to Lockheed to insure loan payments. Admiral Hyman G."
 History , Loan guarantee ,"Rickover condemned the bill saying it represented ""a new philosophy where we privatize profits and socialize losses."" The New York Times editorial board held that the Nixon administration was violating its own free enterprise principles by advocating for the loan. (Later, historian Stephen J. Whitfield viewed the passage of the loan guarantee as a support for the argument that America was shifting away from Lockean liberalism.) Following a fierce debate, Vice President Spiro T. Agnew cast a tie-breaking vote in favor of the measure on August 2, 1971."
 History , Loan guarantee ,"President Nixon signed the bill into law on August 9, 1971 - which became colloquially known as the ""Lockheed Loan"". Even after its adoption, a further controversy developed when the Emergency Loan Guarantee Board set up by the Executive branch to oversee the loan refused to allow Congress' General Accounting Office to examine its records. They argued that the office was attempting ""interference in the decision-making process"" amounting to an effort to ""bully"" and ""harass"" the board. This claim was denied by Comptroller General Elmer B."
 History , Loan guarantee ,"Staats, and efforts were made by Senator William Proxmire to get Treasury Secretary John Connally to testify due to the suspicion that the loan guarantee was in jeopardy. The editorial board of The New York Times blasted the situation, citing it as another argument against the propriety of the loan guarantee and the precedent it set for other failing companies."
 History , Loan guarantee ,"The debate around the ramifications of the Lockheed loan guarantee soon resurfaced in late 1975 with discussions on possible aid to New York City during its fiscal crisis.Lockheed finished paying off the $1.4 billion loan in 1977, along with about $112.22 million in loan guarantee fees."
 History , Bribery scandals ,"The Lockheed bribery scandals were a series of illegal bribes and contributions made by Lockheed officials from the late 1950s to the 1970s. In late 1975 and early 1976, a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate led by Senator Frank Church concluded that members of the Lockheed board had paid members of friendly governments to guarantee contracts for military aircraft."
 History , Bribery scandals ,"In 1976, it was publicly revealed that Lockheed had paid $22 million in bribes to foreign officials in the process of negotiating the sale of aircraft including the F-104 Starfighter, the so-called Deal of the Century.The scandal caused considerable political controversy in West Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and Japan. In the US, the scandal led to passage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and nearly led to the ailing corporation's downfall (it was already struggling due to the poor sales of the L-1011 airliner). Haughton resigned his post as chairman."
 History , Attempted leveraged buyout ,"In the late 1980s, leveraged buyout specialist Harold Simmons conducted a widely publicized but unsuccessful takeover attempt on the Lockheed Corporation, having gradually acquired almost 20 percent of its stock. Lockheed was attractive to Simmons because one of its primary investors was the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), the pension fund of the state of California. At the time, the New York Times said, ""Much of Mr. Simmons's interest in Lockheed is believed to stem from its pension plan, which is over funded by more than $1.4 billion."
 History , Attempted leveraged buyout ,"Analysts said he might want to liquidate the plan and pay out the excess funds to shareholders, including himself."" Citing the mismanagement by its chairman, Daniel M. Tellep, Simmons stated a wish to replace its board with a slate of his own choosing, since he was the largest investor. His board nominations included former Texas Senator John Tower, the onetime chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Admiral Elmo Zumwalt Jr., a former Chief of Naval Operations."
 History , Attempted leveraged buyout ,"Simmons had first begun accumulating Lockheed stock in early 1989 when deep Pentagon cuts to the defense budget had driven down prices of military contractor stocks, and analysts had not believed he would attempt the takeover since he was also at the time pursuing control of Georgia Gulf."
 History , Merger with Martin Marietta ,"Merger talks between Lockheed and Martin Marietta began in March 1994, with the companies announcing their $10 billion planned merger on August 30, 1994. The headquarters for the combined companies would be at Martin Marietta headquarters in North Bethesda, Maryland. The deal was finalized on March 15, 1995, when the two companies' shareholders approved the merger. The segments of the two companies not retained by the new company formed the basis for the L-3 Communications, a mid-size defense contractor in its own right. Lockheed Martin also later spun off the materials company Martin Marietta Materials."
 History , Merger with Martin Marietta ,"The company's executives received large bonuses directly from the government as a result of the merger. Norman R. Augustine who was at the time CEO of Martin Marietta received an $8.2 million bonus.Both companies contributed important products to the new portfolio. Lockheed products included the Trident missile, P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft, U-2 and SR-71 reconnaissance airplanes, F-117 Nighthawk, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor, C-130 Hercules, A-4AR Fightinghawk and the DSCS-3 satellite."
 History , Merger with Martin Marietta ,"Martin Marietta products included Titan rockets, Sandia National Laboratories (management contract acquired in 1993), Space Shuttle External Tank, Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers, the Transfer Orbit Stage (under subcontract to Orbital Sciences Corporation) and various satellite models."

 History ,,"Historically the Ringwood Mines area had been used for iron extraction, and the isolated mountain area includes abandoned mineshafts and pits, landfills and open waste dumps. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the 500-acre site was used by the Ford Motor Company for the disposal of paint sludge and other waste generated at its Mahwah Assembly plant, at that time the largest auto assembly plant in the United States."
 History ,,"By the time of the plant's closure in 1980, ""millions of gallons"" of paint sludge, estimated as enough to fill two of the three tubes of the Lincoln Tunnel, had been dumped in the area. Ford's own records show that during the period 1967-1971 alone, 11,350 tons of paint sludge from Mahwah was dumped at Ringwood. As environmental laws had not yet been passed, Ford claims that the dumping was legal."
 History ,,"Between 1955 - when the plant opened - and 1970, the disposal of industrial waste was ""essentially unregulated"" as a state law against contamination of streams was unenforced.In the 1970s, Ford donated the five acres of the Peters Mine Pit area to the state, which made it part of what is now Ringwood State Park. After 1976 and passage of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), when the corporate disposal of hazardous wastes became more tightly regulated by federal law, the American Mafia conducted illegal dumping at Ringwood."
 History ,,"Vincent ""the Chin"" Gigante of the Genovese crime family reportedly threatened to execute a rival to secure the ""rights"" to dispose of Ford's paint sludge in the area. The involvement of organized crime dated back to at least 1965, as Joseph ""Joey Surprise"" Feola was executed by Louis ""Fat Lou"" LaRasso - on the orders of the Gambino crime family - for ""stealing"" the Ford waste contract. Contractors dumped waste anywhere they could.In 2005 the Bergen Record completed an eight-month investigation, published as a five-part series, Toxic Legacy (available online), on the Ringwood site. It found extensive contamination in the community."
 History ,,"EPA confirmed the area was still contaminated with industrial and hazardous waste, after four cleanups, and placed the site back on the Superfund priority list. Part of the 500-acre site extends into Ringwood State Park. From 2006 to 2011, the EPA has directed the removal of an additional 47,000 tons of contaminated earth and sludge from the site, more than five times what was cleaned up in the first efforts.In 2011, Ford proposed taking back the Peters Mine Pit site, but this has been opposed by environmentalists, concerned that the pit may be packed with contaminants."
 History ,,"More than 65,000 citizens signed an online petition in opposition to the proposal, and the state Department of Environment and Parks said it never considered returning the site to Ford. The work continues on cleanup.Environmentalists are concerned about contaminants getting into groundwater supplies and threatening a watershed that serves 2.5 million residents, a quarter of the state's population. Numerous people have been more directly affected, as Ringwood has historically been a center of population for the Ramapough Mountain Indians, whose children used to play with the bright paints and debris of the landfill."
 History ,,"Their ancestors used to work in the iron mines.During the years of dumping, some of the men would scavenge the debris, seeking copper and other valuable metals for sale. Industrial waste was pushed into pits and mineshafts; paint sludge hardens and appears as slabs near streams. Levels of lead and antimony have been found in paint sludge near residences to be one hundred times safety levels. Numerous families have been affected by high rates of cancer and adverse health effects from contamination near their residences and in the groundwater. In 2006, some 600 Ramapough filed a mass tort suit, Mann v."
 History ,,"Ford, against Ford Motor Company for the dumping. During the 2008–2010 automotive industry crisis, at a time when it appeared that Ford might be in danger of going bankrupt, the Ramapough feared that the company might be gone and Ford acted on those fears, and in September 2009 the tribe accepted a settlement of $11 million from Ford and its contractors, plus $1.5 million from the town of Ringwood, for an average payout of $8,000 per Ramapough resident after attorney fees. The Ramapough suit against Ford has been covered in Mann v. Ford, a documentary produced by HBO."
 History ,,"Directed by Maro Chermayeff and Micah Fink, it features Wayne Mann of the Ramapough and Vicki Gilliam of The Cochran Firm, which represented the tribe. It covers five years in which the tribe pursued the case, as well as arguing before Congress for relief and financial compensation. The plaintiffs have settled with the company. Toxic Legacy by The Record newspaper, a 5-part documentary available online at toxiclegacy.northjersey.com The SundanceTV series The Red Road is a fictionalized account of a police officer and incorporates many elements of the situation into the story, such as the paint sludge and the Ramapo Lenape Nation."
 Geography ,,"Love Canal is a neighborhood located in the city of Niagara Falls in the northwestern region of New York state. The neighborhood covers 36 blocks in the far southeastern corner of the city, stretching from 93rd Street comprising the western border to 100th Street in the east border and 103rd Street in the northeast. Bergholtz Creek defines the northern border with the Niagara River marking the southern border one-quarter mile (400 m) away. The LaSalle Expressway splits an uninhabited portion of the south from the north. The canal covers 16 acres (6.5 ha) of land in the central eastern portion."
 Geography ,,"In 1890, William T. Love, a former railroad lawyer, prepared plans to construct a preplanned urban community of parks and residences on the shore of Lake Ontario. Love, who would become notorious for similar real-estate schemes later in life, claimed it would serve the area's burgeoning industries with much-needed hydroelectricity. He named the project Model City, New York.After 1892, Love's plan incorporated a shipping lane that would bypass Niagara Falls, and facilitate transportation between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. He arranged backing from financial banks in New York City, Chicago, and England. During October 1893, the first factory opened for business."
 Geography ,,"In May 1894, work on the canal began. Steel companies and other manufacturers expressed interest in opening plants along Love Canal. Love began having a canal dug and built a few streets and houses.The Panic of 1893 caused investors to end sponsorship of the project. Then in 1906, environmental groups successfully lobbied Congress to pass a law, designed to preserve Niagara Falls, prohibiting the removal of water from the Niagara River."
 Geography ,,"Only one mile (1.6 km) of the canal was dug, about 50 feet (15 m) wide and 10–40 feet (3–12 m) deep, stretching northward from the Niagara River.The Panic of 1907 combined with the development of the transmission of electrical power over great distances, creating access to hydroelectric power far from water sources, proved disastrous for what remained of the Model City plan. The last piece of property owned by Love's corporation was lost to foreclosure and sold at public auction in 1910."
 Geography ,,"By that point, Love himself was long gone; in 1897 he left the United States for England, before returning to attempt similar schemes in Washington, Illinois, and Delaware. With the project abandoned, the canal gradually filled with water. Local children swam there during summers and skated during the winters. In the 1920s, the city of Niagara Falls used the canal as a municipal landfill.Industry and tourism increased steadily throughout the first half of the 20th century due to a great demand for industrial products and the increased mobility of people to travel."
 Geography ,,"Paper, rubber, plastics, petrochemicals, carbon insulators, and abrasives composed the city's major industries. At the time of the dump's closure in 1952, Niagara Falls was experiencing prosperity, and the population had been expanding dramatically, growing by 31% in twenty years (1940–1960) from 78,020 to 102,394. By the end of the 1940s, Hooker Chemical Company was searching for a place to dispose its large quantity of chemical waste. The Niagara Power and Development Company granted permission to Hooker during 1942 to dump wastes into the canal. The canal was drained and lined with thick clay."
 Geography ,,"Into this site, Hooker began placing 55-US-gallon (210 L) drums. In 1947, Hooker bought the canal and the 70-foot-wide (21 m) banks on either side of the canal. It subsequently converted it into a 16-acre (6.5 ha) landfill.In 1948, the City of Niagara Falls ended self-sufficient disposal of refuse and Hooker Chemical became the sole user and owner of the site. In early 1952, when it became apparent that the site would likely be developed for construction, Hooker ceased use of Love Canal as a dumpsite."
 Geography ,,"During its 10-year lifespan, the landfill served as the dumping site of 21,800 short tons (19,800 t) of chemicals, mostly composed of products such as ""caustics, alkalines, fatty acid and chlorinated hydrocarbons resulting from the manufacturing of dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins"". These chemicals were buried at a depth of twenty to twenty-five feet (6 to 7.5 m). Upon its closure, the canal was covered with a clay seal to prevent leakage. Over time, vegetation settled and began to grow atop the dump site. By the 1950s, the city of Niagara Falls was experiencing a population increase."
 Geography ,,"With a growing population, the Niagara Falls City School District needed land to build new schools and attempted to purchase the property from Hooker Chemical. The population reached more than 98,000 by the 1950 census. During March 1951, the school board prepared a plan showing a school being built over the canal and listing condemnation values for each property that would need to be acquired. During March 1952, the superintendent of Niagara Falls School Board inquired of Hooker with regard to purchasing the Love Canal property for the purpose of constructing a new school."
 Geography ,,"After this, in an internal company memorandum dated March 27, 1952, Bjarne Klaussen, Hooker's vice president, wrote to the works manager that ""it may be advisable to discontinue using the Love Canal property for a dumping ground."" During April 1952, after discussing the sale of the land with Ansley Wilcox II, Hooker's in-house legal counsel, Klaussen then wrote to the company president, R.L."
 Geography ,,"Murray, suggesting that the sale could alleviate them from future liabilities for the buried chemicals: The more we thought about it, the more interested Wilcox and I became in the proposition, and finally came to the conclusion that the Love Canal property is rapidly becoming a liability because of housing projects in the near vicinity of our property. A school, however, could be built in the center unfilled section (with chemicals underground)."
 Geography ,,"We became convinced that it would be a wise move to turn this property over to the schools provided we could not be held responsible for future claims or damages resulting from underground storage of chemicals. While the school board condemned some nearby properties, Hooker agreed to sell its property to the school board for $1."

 Geography ,,"negotiations noted that ""in view of the nature of the property and the purposes for which it has been used, it will be necessary for us to have special provisions incorporated into the deed with respect to the use of the property and other pertinent matters."" The board rejected the company's proposal that the deed require the land to be used for park purposes only, with the school itself to be built nearby.As ""a means of avoiding liability by relinquishing control of the site"", Hooker deeded the site to the school board in 1953 for $1 with a liability limitation clause."
 Geography ,,"The sale document signed on April 28, 1953, included a seventeen-line caveat purporting to release the company from all legal obligations should lawsuits occur during the future. Prior to the delivery of this instrument of conveyance, the grantee herein has been advised by the grantor that the premises above described have been filled, in whole or in part, to the present grade level thereof with waste products resulting from the manufacturing of chemicals by the grantor at its plant in the City of Niagara Falls, New York, and the grantee assumes all risk and liability incident to the use thereof."
 Geography ,,"It is therefore understood and agreed that, as a part of the consideration for this conveyance and as a condition thereof, no claim, suit, action or demand of any nature whatsoever shall ever be made by the grantee, its successors or assigns, against the grantor, its successors or assigns, for injury to a person or persons, including death resulting therefrom, or loss of or damage to property caused by, in connection with or by reason of the presence of said industrial wastes."
 Geography ,,"It is further agreed as a condition hereof that each subsequent conveyance of the aforesaid lands shall be made subject to the foregoing provisions and conditions. Critics of Hooker's actions believe that, in the words of Craig E. Colton and Peter N. Skinner, ""Hooker assigned the board with a continuing duty to protect property buyers from chemicals when the company itself accepted no such 'moral obligation'."" The transfer effectively ended what provision of security and maintenance for the hazardous waste had existed before and placed all responsibility in clearly unqualified hands."
 Geography ,,"It was this attempt to evade their responsibility, Colten and Skinner contend, that would ""ultimately come back to haunt not only Hooker but all other chemical producers in the United States through the strict liability provisions of Superfund legislation."" However, Eric Zeusse writes that Hooker's decision to sell the property rather than allowing the school board to condemn it stemmed from a desire to document its warnings. ""Had the land been condemned and seized, says Hooker, the company would have been unable to air its concerns to all future owners of the property."
 Geography ,,"It is difficult to see any other reason for what it did.""Not long after having taken control of the land, the Niagara Falls School Board proceeded to develop the land, including construction activity that substantially breached containment structures in a number of ways, allowing previously trapped chemicals to seep out. The resulting breaches combined with particularly heavy rainstorms released and spread the chemical waste, resulting in a public health emergency and an urban planning scandal."
 Geography ,,"In what became a test case for liability clauses, Hooker Chemical was found to be ""negligent"" in their disposal of waste, though not reckless in the sale of the land. The dumpsite was discovered and investigated by the local newspaper, the Niagara Falls Gazette, from 1976 through the evacuation in 1978. Despite the disclaimer, the School Board began construction of the ""99th Street School"" in its originally intended location."
 Geography ,,"In January 1954, the school's architect wrote to the education committee informing them that during excavation, workers discovered two dump sites filled with 55-US-gallon (210 L; 46 imp gal) drums containing chemical wastes. The architect also noted it would be ""poor policy"" to build in that area since it was not known what wastes were present in the ground, and the concrete foundation might be damaged. The school board then relocated the school site eighty to eighty-five feet (24 to 26 m) further north."
 Geography ,,"The kindergarten playground also had to be relocated because it was directly on top of a chemical dump. Upon completion in 1955, 400 children attended the school, and it opened along with several other schools that had been built to accommodate students. That same year, a twenty-five-foot (7.6 m) area crumbled exposing toxic chemical drums, which then filled with water during rainstorms. This created large puddles that children enjoyed playing in. In 1955, a second school, the 93rd Street School, was opened six blocks away."
 Geography ,,"The school district sold the remaining land, resulting in homes being constructed by private developers, as well as the Niagara Falls Housing Authority. The sale came despite the warning of a Hooker attorney, Arthur Chambers, that, as paraphrased in the minutes of a board meeting, due to chemical waste having been dumped in that area, the land was not suitable for construction where underground facilities would be necessary."
 Geography ,,"He stated that his company could not prevent the Board from selling the land or from doing anything they wanted to with it but it was their intent that this property be used for a school and for parking. He further stated that they feel the property should not be divided for the purpose of building homes and hoped that no one will be injured.During 1957, the City of Niagara Falls constructed sewers for a mixture of low-income and single family residences to be built on lands adjacent to the landfill site."
 Geography ,,"While building the gravel sewer beds, construction crews broke through the clay seal, breaching the canal walls. Specifically, the local government removed part of the protective clay cap to use as fill dirt for the nearby 93rd Street School, and punched holes in the solid clay walls to build water lines and the LaSalle Expressway. This allowed the toxic wastes to escape when rainwater, no longer kept out by the partially removed clay cap, washed them through the gaps in the walls. Hence, the buried chemicals could migrate and seep from the canal."
 Geography ,,"The land where the homes were being built was not part of the agreement between the school board and Hooker; thus, none of these residents knew the canal's history. There was no monitoring or evaluating of the chemical wastes stored under the ground. Additionally, the clay cover of the canal which was supposed to be impermeable began to crack. The subsequent construction of the LaSalle Expressway restricted groundwater from flowing to the Niagara River. After the exceptionally wet winter and spring of 1962, the elevated expressway turned the breached canal into an overflowing pool."
 Geography ,,"People reported having puddles of oil or colored liquid in yards or basements.By the 1970s, the Love Canal area was an established suburban community that appealed to commuters and families. It was proximate to the school and newly constructed churches, it was conveniently located just a few miles from the city center, and the expressway provided access to shopping and leisure opportunities. Census data revealed the area had a higher than median income, and the majority of its households included young children. Due to the great percentage of new construction in the area, less than 3% of housing units were unoccupied."
 Geography ,,"In 1976, a report evaluating Niagara Falls ranked Love Canal the fourth-best area in ""social well-being."" In total, 800 private houses and 240 low-income apartments were constructed. Before the public revelation of the environmental crisis, developers were planning to expand the area with additional homes. There were 410 children in the school during 1978. Residents were suspicious of black fluid that flowed out of the Love Canal. For years, residents had complained about odors and substances in their yards or the public playgrounds. Finally the city acted and hired a consultant, Calspan Corporation, to do a far-reaching study."
 Geography ,,"In 1977, a harsh winter storm dumped 33–45 inches (84–114 cm) of snow, significantly raising the water table. The excess water got into the ground water and raised the elevation of contaminants including dioxin. During the spring of 1977, the State Departments of Health and Environmental Conservation began an intensive air, soil, and groundwater sampling and analysis program after qualitative identification of a number of organic compounds in the basements of 11 homes adjacent to the Love Canal."
 Geography ,,It was also revealed that the standards at the time did not require the installation of a liner to prevent leaching; this became very common among companies.
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"Numerous contaminants dumped in the landfill included chlorinated hydrocarbon residues, processed sludge, fly ash, and other materials, including residential municipal garbage.Data showed unacceptable levels of toxic vapors associated with more than 80 compounds were emanating from the basements of numerous homes in the first ring directly adjacent to the Love Canal."
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"Ten of the most prevalent and most toxic compounds - including benzene, a known human carcinogen - were selected for evaluation purposes and as indicators of the presence of other chemical constituents.Laboratory analyses of soil and sediment samples from the Love Canal indicate the presence of more than 200 distinct organic chemical compounds; approximately 100 of these have been identified to date.Numerous other chemicals seeped through the ground. Some of the chemicals and toxic materials found included benzene, chloroform, toluene, dioxin, and various kinds of PCB."
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"At first, scientific studies did not conclusively prove the chemicals were responsible for the residents' illnesses yet scientists were divided on the issue, even though eleven known or suspected carcinogens had been identified, one of the most prevalent being benzene. Also present was dioxin (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins) in the water, a very hazardous substance. Dioxin pollution is usually measured in parts per trillion; at Love Canal, water samples showed dioxin levels of 53 parts per billion (53,000 parts per trillion). Geologists were recruited to determine whether underground swales were responsible for carrying the chemicals to the surrounding residential areas."
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"Once there, chemicals could leach into basements and evaporate into household air. In 1979, the EPA announced the result of blood tests which showed high white blood cell counts, a precursor to leukemia, and chromosome damage in Love Canal residents. 33% of the residents had undergone chromosomal damage. In a typical population, chromosomal damage affects 1% of people. Other studies were unable to find harm. The United States National Research Council (NRC) surveyed Love Canal health studies during 1991."
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"The NRC noted the major exposure of concern was the groundwater rather than drinking water; the groundwater ""seeped into basements"" and then resulted in exposure through air and soil. Several studies reported higher levels of low-birth weight babies and birth defects among the exposed residents with some evidence the effect subsided after the exposure was eliminated. The National Research Council also noted a study which found exposed children were found to have an ""excess of seizures, learning problems, hyperactivity, eye irritation, skin rashes, abdominal pain, and incontinence"" and stunted growth."
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"Voles in the area were found to have significantly increased mortality compared to controls (mean life expectancy in exposed animals ""23.6 and 29.2 days, respectively, compared to 48.8 days"" for control animals). New York State also has an ongoing health study of Love Canal residents. In that year, the Albert Elia Building Co., Inc., now Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc., was selected as the principal contractor to safely re-bury the toxic waste at the Love Canal Site. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1979, residents exhibited a ""disturbingly high rate of miscarriages ..."
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"Love Canal can now be added to a growing list of environmental disasters involving toxics, ranging from industrial workers stricken by nervous disorders and cancers to the discovery of toxic materials in the milk of nursing mothers."" In one case, two out of four children in a single Love Canal family had birth defects; one girl was born deaf with a cleft palate, an extra row of teeth, and slight retardation, and a boy was born with an eye defect."
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"In 1976, two reporters for the Niagara Falls Gazette, David Pollak and David Russell, tested several sump pumps near Love Canal and found toxic chemicals in them. The Gazette published reports, once in October 1976 and once in November 1976, of chemical analyses of residues near the old Love Canal dumpsite indicated presence of 15 organic chemicals, including three toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons."
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"The matter became quiet for more than a year and was then revived by reporter Michael Brown, who then investigated potential health effects by performing an informal door-to-door survey during early 1978, writing a hundred news items on toxic wastes in the area and finding birth defects and many anomalies such as enlarged feet, heads, hands, and legs. He advised the local residents to create a protest group, which was organized by resident Karen Schroeder, whose daughter had many (about a dozen) birth defects."
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"The New York State Health Department investigated and found an abnormal incidence of miscarriages.Brown discovered the size of the canal, the presence of dioxin, the expanding contamination, and the involvement, to an extent, of the U.S. Army. Hooker threatened to sue him and he fought the firm for years, including on the Today Show. His book on toxic wastes, Laying Waste: The Poisoning of America By Toxic Chemicals, was the first written on the subject of toxic wastes and created a national firestorm, as did articles of his in The New York Times Magazine and The Atlantic Monthly."
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"He also discovered a huge dump called the Hyde Park landfill (or Bloody Run) and the ""S-Area,"" which was leaking into the water supply for Niagara Falls. His work inspired many activists. He spoke for ten years on the college lecture circuit.Congressman John LaFalce (D), who represented the district, paid a high profile visit to Love Canal in September 1977, to raise attention to the serious problems."
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"LaFalce intervened to get city, state and federal officials, and Hooker executives, involved to take quick action, but he was met with resistance, apathy and stalling.By 1978, Love Canal had become a national media event with articles referring to the neighborhood as ""a public health time bomb"", and ""one of the most appalling environmental tragedies in American history"". Brown, working for the local newspaper, the Niagara Gazette, is credited with not only revealing the case, but establishing toxic chemical wastes as a nationwide issue as well."
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"Brown's book, Laying Waste, examined the Love Canal disaster and many other toxic waste catastrophes nationwide.The dumpsite was declared an unprecedented state of emergency on August 2, 1978. Brown, who wrote more than a hundred articles concerning the dump, tested the groundwater and later found the dump was three times larger than originally thought, with possible ramifications beyond the original evacuation zone. He was also to discover that toxic dioxins were there. Activism at Love Canal was initially organized by community residents Tom Heiser and Lois Gibbs, with Lois Gibbs often serving as spokesperson."
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"Gibbs's strategies emphasized concerns for children and families of the affected area, with women taking the most prominent public and active roles. Many men also helped women in these efforts, though not always publicly. Men who were hesitant to oppose Hooker Chemical openly for example, were able to contribute to the movement through increased contributions to family labor in the absence of their activist wives.In addition to community organizing and pressuring authorities for appropriate responses, direct-action forms of activism were employed. Tactics included protests and rallies, which were intentionally timed and planned in an effort to maximize media attention."
 Lead-up and discovery , Contaminants ,"Such events included ""controversial"" methods such as mothers protesting while pushing strollers, marching by pregnant women, and children holding protest signs. Notably, two EPA employees were also held hostage by activists for approximately five hours at the LCHA office, in order to bring their demands to the attention of the federal government."
 Activism tactics , Role of community organizations ,"Numerous organizations were formed in response to the crisis at Love Canal, with members' activism emphasizing variously overlapping interests. In addition to the Love Canal Homeowners Association (LCHA), other major organizations involved included the Ecumenical Taskforce (ETF), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the Concerned Love Canal Renters Association (CLCRA). These organizations are often overlooked in the story of Love Canal, according to research by Elizabeth Blum in Love Canal Revisited. The Ecumenical Taskforce (ETF) was a religious organization composed of volunteers from the surrounding area."
 Activism tactics , Role of community organizations ,"In conjunction with other citizens' groups such as LCHA and LCARA, the ETF used their resources to promote environmental health and gender, class, and racial equality.The NAACP became involved with the Love Canal issue after William Abrams Sr., president of the Niagara Falls chapter drew attention to his wife's fatal liver failure. Abrams's involvement drew attention to racial inequality present in the community and concerns about how this could affect comprehensive relocation efforts. Abrams contacted the regional NAACP director who announced that discrimination against minorities at Love Canal would be met with legal action."
 Activism tactics , Role of community organizations ,"This involvement inspired additional support and activism, particularly on behalf of members of the renting community, many of whom were also members of the African-American and immigrant communities at the site.Another subgroup of local residents formed the Concerned Love Canal Renters Association (CLCRA)."
 Activism tactics , Role of community organizations ,"This group's action sought to address the needs of the (largely, but not exclusively, African-American) renter community, whose interests were at times perceived to be in conflict with those of some members of the (predominantly white) property owners represented by the LCHA.In 1980, Lois Gibbs established the Center for Health, Environment, and Justice as a continuation of her activism at Love Canal."
 Activism tactics , Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association ,"On August 2, 1978, Lois Gibbs, a local mother who called an election to head the Love Canal Homeowners' Association, began to rally homeowners. Her son, Michael Gibbs, began attending school in September 1977. He developed epilepsy in December, suffered from asthma and a urinary tract infection, and had a low white blood cell count, all associated with his exposure to the leaking chemical waste. Gibbs had learned from Brown that her neighborhood sat atop the buried chemical waste.During the following years, Gibbs organized an effort to investigate community concerns about the health of its residents."
 Activism tactics , Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association ,"She and other residents made repeated complaints of strange odors and ""substances"" that surfaced in their yards. In Gibbs' neighborhood, there was a high rate of unexplained illnesses, miscarriages, and intellectual disability. Basements were often covered with a thick, black substance, and vegetation was dying. In many yards, the only vegetation that grew were shrubby grasses. Although city officials were asked to investigate the area, they did not act to solve the problem. Niagara Falls mayor Michael O'Laughlin infamously stated that there was ""nothing wrong"" in Love Canal. With further investigation, Gibbs discovered the chemical danger of the adjacent canal."
 Activism tactics , Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association ,"This began her organization's two-year effort to demonstrate that the waste buried by Hooker Chemical was responsible for the health problems of local residents. Throughout the ordeal, homeowners' concerns were ignored not only by Hooker Chemical (now a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum), but also by members of government. These parties argued that the area's endemic health problems were unrelated to the toxic chemicals buried in the Canal. Since the residents could not prove the chemicals on their property had come from Hooker's disposal site, they could not prove liability."
 Activism tactics , Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association ,"Throughout the legal battle, residents were unable to sell their properties and relocate. On August 7, 1978, United States President Jimmy Carter announced a federal health emergency, called for the allocation of federal funds, and ordered the Federal Disaster Assistance Agency to assist the City of Niagara Falls to remedy the Love Canal site. This was the first time in American history that emergency funds were used for a situation other than a natural disaster."
 Activism tactics , Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association ,"Carter had trenches built that would transport the wastes to sewers and had home sump pumps sealed off.Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), better known as the Superfund Act. Love Canal became the first entry on the list. CERCLA created a tax on the chemical and petroleum industries and provided broad Federal authority to respond directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health or the environment. CERCLA also created a National Priorities List, a shortened list of the sites that has priority in cleanup."
 Activism tactics , Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association ,"Love Canal was the first Superfund site on that list. Eventually, the site was cleaned and deleted off the list in 2004. Because the Superfund Act contained a ""retroactive liability"" provision, Occidental was held liable for cleanup of the waste even though it had followed all applicable U.S. laws when disposing of it. When Eckhardt C. Beck (EPA Administrator for Region 2, 1977–1979) visited Love Canal during the late 1970s, he discerned the presence of toxic substances in the community: I visited the canal area at that time. Corroding waste-disposal drums could be seen breaking up through the grounds of backyards."
 Activism tactics , Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association ,"Trees and gardens were turning black and dying. One entire swimming pool had been popped up from its foundation, afloat now on a small sea of chemicals. Puddles of noxious substances were pointed out to me by the residents. Some of these puddles were in their yards, some were in their basements, others yet were on the school grounds. Everywhere the air had a faint, choking smell. Children returned from play with burns on their hands and faces."

 Activism tactics , Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association ,"constituted an emergency, stating: ""Love Canal Chemical Waste Landfill constitutes a public nuisance and an extremely serious threat and danger to the health, safety and welfare of those using it, living near it or exposed to the conditions emanating from it, consisting among other things, of chemical wastes lying exposed on the surface in numerous places pervasive, pernicious and obnoxious chemical vapors and fumes affecting both the ambient air and the homes of certain residents living near such sites."" Whalen also instructed people to avoid going into their basements as well as to avoid fruits and vegetables grown in their gardens."
 Activism tactics , Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners' Association ,"People became very worried because many had consumed produce from their gardens for several years. Whalen urged that all pregnant women and children under the age of two be removed from Love Canal as soon as possible. The 99th Street School, on the other hand, was located within the former boundary of the Hooker Chemical landfill site. The school was closed and demolished, but both the school board and the chemical company refused to accept liability. The 93rd Street School was closed some two years later because of concerns about seeping toxic waste."
 Aftermath , Evacuation ,"The lack of public interest in Love Canal made matters worse for the homeowners' association, which was opposed by two organizations that sought to disprove negligence. Initially, members of the association had been frustrated by the lack of a public entity that could advise and defend them. Gibbs met with public resistance from a number of residents within the community. Eventually, the federal government relocated more than 800 families and reimbursed them for the loss of their homes. The state government and federal government used $15 million to purchase 400 homes closest to Love Canal and demolished several rings of houses."
 Aftermath , Litigation and compensation ,"In 1994, Federal District Judge John Curtin ruled that Hooker/Occidental had been negligent, but not reckless, in its handling of the waste and sale of the land to the Niagara Falls School Board. Curtin's decision also contains a detailed history of events leading up to the Love Canal disaster. Occidental Petroleum was sued by the EPA and in 1995 agreed to pay $129 million in restitution. Out of that federal lawsuit came money for a small health fund and $3.5 million for the state health study. Residents' lawsuits were also settled in the years following the Love Canal disaster."
 Aftermath , Litigation and compensation ,"The Department of Justice published a report noting that the sites have been successfully remediated and are ready again for use. The Love Canal Area Revitalization Authority sold a few abandoned homes to private citizens. Virtually all remedial activities of the site, other than the operation of the leachate collection system, were completed by 1989."
 Aftermath , Remediation ,"Houses in the residential areas on the east and west sides of the canal were demolished. All that remains on the west side are abandoned residential streets. Some older east side residents, whose houses stand alone in the demolished neighborhood, chose to stay. It was estimated that fewer than 90 of the original 900 families opted to remain. They were willing to remain as long as they were guaranteed that their homes were in a relatively safe area. On June 4, 1980, the state government founded the Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency (LCARA) to restore the area."
 Aftermath , Remediation ,"The area north of Love Canal became known as Black Creek Village. LCARA wanted to resell 300 homes that had been bought by New York when the residents were relocated. The homes are farther away from where the chemicals were dumped. The most toxic area (16 acres (65,000 m2)) was reburied with a thick plastic liner, clay and dirt. A 2.4-metre (7 ft 10 in) high barbed wire fence was installed around the area. It has been calculated that 248 separate chemicals, including 60 kilograms (130 lb) of dioxin, have been unearthed from the canal."
 Aftermath , Analysis ,"In 1998, Elizabeth Whelan, founder of industry advocacy group American Council on Science and Health, wrote an editorial about the Canal in which she stated that the media started calling the Canal a ""public health time bomb"", an editorial that created minor hysteria. She declared that people were not falling ill because of exposure to chemical waste, but from stress caused by the media."
 Aftermath , Analysis ,"Besides double the rate of birth defects to children born while living on Love Canal, a follow-up study two decades after the incident ""showed increased risks of low birth weight, congenital malformations and other adverse reproductive events"".Love Canal, along with Times Beach, Missouri and the Valley of the Drums, Kentucky, are important in United States environmental history as three sites that significantly contributed to the passing of the CERCLA."
 Aftermath , Analysis ,"Love Canal ""become the symbol for what happens when hazardous industrial products are not confined to the workplace but 'hit people where they live' in inestimable amounts"".Love Canal was not an isolated case. Eckardt C. Beck suggested that there are probably hundreds of similar dumpsites. President Carter declared that discovering these dumpsites was ""one of the grimmest discoveries of the modern era"". Had the residents of Love Canal been aware that they were residing on toxic chemicals, most would not have moved there in the first place."
 Aftermath , Analysis ,"Beck noted that one main problem remains that ownership of such chemical companies can change over the years, making liability difficult to assign (a problem that would be addressed by CERCLA, or the Superfund Act). Beck contended that increased commitment was necessary to develop controls that would ""defuse future Love Canals"".Some free market environmentalist activists have cited the Love Canal incident as a consequence of government decision-makers not taking responsibility for their decisions. Stroup writes, ""The school district owning the land had a laudable but narrow goal: it wanted to provide education cheaply for district children."
 Aftermath , Analysis ,"Government decision makers are seldom held accountable for broader social goals in the way that private owners are by liability rules and potential profits."""
 Aftermath , Conclusion ,"In 2004, federal officials announced that the Superfund cleanup has ended, although cleanup had concluded years prior. The entire process occurred over 21 years and cost a total of $400 million. About 260 homes north of the canal have been renovated and sold to new owners, and about 150 acres (61 ha) east of the canal have been sold to commercial developers for light industrial uses. In total, 950 families had been evacuated. The site was removed from the Superfund list on September 30, 2004. The Niagara Sanitation landfill covers 18.7 acres (7.6 ha) in Wheatfield, New York."
 Aftermath , Conclusion ,"The state Department of Transportation moved approximately 1,600 cubic yards (1,200 m3) of material from the Love Canal landfill to Niagara Sanitation. Residents of North Tonawanda and Wheatfield suffering severe health problems say the waste was subsequently disturbed during the construction of the LaSalle Expressway in Niagara Falls. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) contends there is no proof the landfill leaks."
 Aftermath , Conclusion ,"A lawsuit asserts that Hooker's creation of a brine pipeline along the edge of the landfill used to move brine from Wyoming County to its Niagara Falls plant location, may have created a conduit for the landfilled waste to leak out. The legacy of the disaster inspired a fictionalized 1982 made-for-TV film titled Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal. An award-winning documentary by Lynn Corcoran titled In Our Own Backyard was released in the U.S. in 1983."
 Aftermath , Conclusion ,"Modern Marvels retold the disaster in 2004.Joyce Carol Oates included the story of Love Canal in her 2004 novel The Falls, but changed the time period of the disaster to the 1960s. The latest history of Love Canal is Paradise Falls: The True Story of an Environmental Catastrophe, written by journalist Keith O’Brien, published by Pantheon in 2022. The film Tootsie has a character (played by Bill Murray) attempting to produce a play called ""Return to Love Canal""."
 Aftermath , Conclusion ,"In response to the pitch for the play, Sydney Pollack tells Dustin Hoffman that ""Nobody wants to produce a play about a couple that moved back to Love Canal. Nobody wants to pay twenty dollars to see people living next to chemical waste. They can see that in New Jersey.""""Love Canal"" was also a segment in the premiere episode of Michael Moore's television series TV Nation, which featured realtors attempting to lure prospective residents to the area. ""Love Canal"" is the name of a 7"" single released by the punk rock band Flipper in February 1981."
 Aftermath , Conclusion ,"The lyrics are about the disaster.In the 2000 film Erin Brockovich, when legal counsel Ed Masry holds a town meeting to discuss arbitration in the case of Hinkley groundwater contamination by Pacific Gas and Electric, the townsfolk are reluctant to agree. When they turn on the idea, Masry brings up Love Canal, as an example where going to trial would be more time-consuming and difficult, explaining that many plaintiffs still had open cases being settled or appealed."
 Aftermath , Conclusion ,"When the film was set, in 1993, litigation for Love Canal was still ongoing, despite coming to public and government attention in the late 1970s. 102nd Street chemical landfill, a landfill located immediately to the south of Love Canal.

 Key provisions of the rescinded 2015 rule ,,The 2015 rule ensures that Clean Water Act (CWA) programs are more precisely defined and intends to save time and avoid costs and confusion in future implementation of the act. The rule intends to make it is easier to predict what action(s) will be taken by the EPA and what processes companies and other stakeholders may have to undergo for projects and permitting. There are no direct changes to the law under the Clean Water Rule.
 Key provisions of the rescinded 2015 rule ,,"After analysis, the EPA and Department of the Army found that higher instance of water coverage would produce a 2:1 ratio of benefits to costs in implementation after the final rule. Implementation of the rule will discern any implications for environmental justice communities, though it is clear that ""meaningful involvement from minority, low-income, and indigenous populations, as well as other stakeholders, has been a cornerstone of development of the final rule."" Specific details that have been clarified by the rule are outlined below."
 Key provisions of the rescinded 2015 rule ,,"Defines more clearly the tributaries and adjacent waters that are under federal jurisdiction and explains how they are coveredA tributary, or upstream water, must show physical features of flowing water – a bed, bank, and ordinary high water mark – to warrant protection. The rule provides protection for headwaters that have these features and have a significant connection to downstream waters. Adjacent waters are defined by three qualifying circumstances established by the rule. These can include wetlands, ponds, impoundments, and lakes which can impact the chemical, biological or physical integrity of neighboring waters."
 Key provisions of the rescinded 2015 rule ,,"Carries over existing exclusions from the Clean Water ActAll existing exclusions from longstanding agency practices are officially established for the first time. Waters used in normal agricultural, ranching, or silvicultural activities, as well as certain defined ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems continue to be excluded. Reduces categories of waters which are subject to case-by-case analysisBefore the rule, almost any water could be put through an analysis that remained case-specific, even if it would not be covered under CWA. The rule limits use of case-specific analysis by providing certainty and clarity of protected vs non-protected water."
 Key provisions of the rescinded 2015 rule ,,"Ultimately the rule saves time and avoids further evaluation and the need to take the case to court. Protects US ""regional water treasures""Specific watersheds have been shown to impact downstream water health. The rule protects Texas coastal prairie wetlands, coastal depressions called Carolina Bays and the related seasonal Delmarva bays, western vernal pools in California, pocosins, and other prairie potholes, when impacting downstream waterways. The Clean Water Act is the primary federal law regulating water pollution in the United States. The language of the Clean Water Act describes itself as pertaining to ""Waters of the United States""."
 Key provisions of the rescinded 2015 rule ,,"The act defines these waters as ""navigable waterways"", which connects the act to constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce. Two U.S. Supreme Court decisions, in 2001 and 2006, interpreted the law to include waters not presently navigable that were formerly navigable that might be readily dredged to be restored to navigation or be made available for navigation. The scope of these decisions cast into doubt lower court decisions interpreting the act's authority to extend regulatory authority to streams, wetlands, and small bodies of water not navigable in the sense of the interstate commerce clause."
 Key provisions of the rescinded 2015 rule ,,These decisions highlighted a need for the EPA and USACE to more precisely define and justify an implicit regulatory authority over tributaries flowing into the navigable waterways for which a clear statutory authority is provided.
" Defining ""Waters of the United States"" ", Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC) v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ,"The Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC), Illinois, was denied federal permits to develop an old gravel mine site into a landfill because migratory bird ponds had developed in abandoned excavation trenches on the property. The Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that the authority granted by CWA did not extend to abandoned gravel pits with seasonal ponds."
" Defining ""Waters of the United States"" ", Rapanos v. United States ,"In 1989, land developer John Rapanos filled twenty-two acres (nine hectares) on his property some 10-20 miles from the nearest navigable waters that his environmental consultant had classified as wetlands without a permit from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. Rapanos v. United States resulted in a 2006 Supreme Court decision with five justices concurring to vacate rulings against the defendants, but issuing three distinctly differing opinions leaving uncertain which of the described tests defined the limit of the federal authority to regulate wetlands."
" Defining ""Waters of the United States"" ", Rapanos v. United States ,"The resulting ambiguity became a part of the stated rationale for EPA rulemaking activity that resulted in the 2015 Waters of the United States rule. Following the SWANCC ruling, the EPA (then under the George W. Bush administration) issued guidelines in 2003 restricting regulatory review of some 20 million acres of isolated wetlands and gave advance notice of proposed rulemaking which would substantially narrow the scope of WOTUS and weaken CWA protections."
" Defining ""Waters of the United States"" ", Rapanos v. United States ,"After strong opposition from Congress the planned legislation was abandoned, to the relief of environmental advocates and disappointment of land development groups who sought a reduction in federal wetlands protection.The lack of a majority opinion in the 2006 Rapanos case prompted a second set of EPA guidelines directing the agency to determine wetlands protection on a case-by-case basis. This contributed to an uptick in lawsuits for the next 8 years challenging the EPA's regulatory authority over streams and wetlands."
" Defining ""Waters of the United States"" ", Rapanos v. United States ,"Seeking to reduce confusion and to restore the original scope of WOTUS to pre-SWANCC levels, repeated unsuccessful attempts were made to pass a bill called the ""Clean Water Authority Restoration Act"" in each Congress from 2002 to 2010.In April 2011, the EPA, under the Barack Obama administration, proposed a new set of guidelines to replace the two issued under the Bush administration. These guidelines formed the basis of what became the Clean Water Rule."
" Defining ""Waters of the United States"" ", Rapanos v. United States ,"In contrast to the manner in which the 2003 and 2007 guidelines were issued, the EPA and the USACE conducted peer-reviewed hydrological studies, interagency reviews, and economic analyses before publishing a formal proposed rule on April 21, 2014.On May 27, 2015, after a public comment period and numerous meetings with state entities, public and private stakeholders, then-EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy along with Assistant Army Secretary Jo-Ellen Darcy signed the Clean Water Rule, set to become effective in August of that year."
" Defining ""Waters of the United States"" ", Rapanos v. United States ,"EPA had stated that the 2015 rule created no additional burden for stakeholders working in agriculture since there was no change to the exemptions for activities necessary to forestry, ranching, or farming. The rule provided clearer protection of many waters of the U.S. that, if polluted, could have detrimental effects on drinking water, habitats, and flood-prone areas. One U.S."
" Defining ""Waters of the United States"" ", Rapanos v. United States ,"water news organization stressed that, while the rule was an update to the CWA, there is still a need for more regulation since more than half of the nation's streams and rivers do not meet standards and most pollution issues come from nonpoint sources, such as agricultural runoff. Many people, 117 million according to EPA, rely on drinking water, in addition to many others who subside on fishing, from sources protected under the implementation of the rule.Low-income communities and communities of color are more often at risk of being affected by pollution."
" Defining ""Waters of the United States"" ", Rapanos v. United States ,"It has also been evidenced that, ""states conduct fewer regulatory enforcement actions in counties with higher levels of poverty."" The Environmental Justice Coalition for Water expressed, in its comment on the rule, the need to ""strengthen the categorical protections"" to wetlands, to minimize flooding and support pollution remediation.While there are no direct implications for indigenous peoples, tribal communities were consulted during the process of finalizing the Clean Water Rule. A separate, revised interpretive rule to the Clean Water Act, section 518, determined tribal lands should be treated as states and was made effective in May 2016."
" Defining ""Waters of the United States"" ", Rapanos v. United States ,"This amendment is important for giving people living on reservations access to EPA regulation and federal grants; tribes no longer need to ""demonstrate inherent authority to regulate"" their waters.The regulation at the state level is determined by the strength of federal coverage and some stakeholders consider the rule to be overreach by the government. There is concern from private landowners, including small business owners and farmers, that this ""rule will lead to radical environmental groups suing homeowners and small businesses,"" and, ultimately, ""increased regulatory costs, less economic development, fewer jobs."""
 Legal challenges and opposition , Partisan and industry opposition ,"Government regulation and protection of fresh water supplies and watershed health is frequently perceived on the political right as a burden on economic growth and an infringement of landowner rights. The Clean Water Rule was part of a larger mobilization by the Obama administration to ingrain the presidency with an environmental legacy, which Republicans have viewed as an “over-reach” of executive power.The pushback against the Clean Water Rule also include some Democrats from ""farm and energy states""."
 Legal challenges and opposition , Partisan and industry opposition ,"Some state and local governments also consider the Clean Water Rule an unconstitutional over-reach violating federalism principles and due process provisions outlined in the 10th and 14th amendments respectively. Legal objections could also be raised on the principle that the Clean Water Act itself violates the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.On February 22, 2017, the Business Roundtable provided a list of federal regulations to the Trump administration which it wished to have reviewed for repeal or major reform; the Clean Water Rule was among the ""wishlist"" of sixteen. The roundtable is a consortium of large corporations including J.P."
 Legal challenges and opposition , Partisan and industry opposition ,"Morgan Chase, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, and Dow Chemical Company."
 Legal challenges and opposition , Federal stay ,"After thirteen states sued to block the rule, U.S. Chief District Judge for North Dakota Ralph R. Erickson issued a preliminary injunction in 2015, hours before the rule was to take effect, blocking regulation in those states. In a separate case, the Sixth Circuit Court temporarily halted implementation of the 2015 Rule by issuing a nationwide stay on October 9, 2015, which was the day before the rule was supposed to come into effect."
 Legal challenges and opposition , Federal stay ,"The Sixth Circuit's decision was overturned on January 22, 2018 when the Supreme Court of the United States issued a unanimous decision that the appeals courts do not have original jurisdiction to review challenges to the Clean Water Act and, therefore, lack the authority to issue a stay. Rather, challenges to the 2015 Rule must be filed in United States district courts."
 Legal challenges and opposition , Federal stay ,"Donald Trump, as part of his 2016 presidential campaign had set a goal of repealing or weakening the WOTUS rule, and once in office, began to act on that pledge, stating that the rule was a ""massive power grab"" by the government on farmers, home owners, and land commissioners, stalling economic growth. On February 28, 2017 Trump signed an executive order directing EPA to review the Clean Water Rule for conflicts with his economic growth agenda. On March 6, 2017 the Trump administration announced its intent to review and rescind or revise the rule."
 Legal challenges and opposition , Federal stay ,"The Trump administration's choice for the EPA water chief, David Ross, represented the state of Wyoming in 2015 in a lawsuit against EPA's interpretation of WOTUS.On February 16, 2017 Trump signed a law disapproving and vacating the Stream Protection Rule. The rule, published by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement on December 20, 2016 with just 31 days left in the Obama Administration's term of office, regulated mountaintop removal mining sites. In January 2018 EPA formally suspended the 2015 WOTUS regulation and announced plans to issue a new version later in 2018."

 Plot ,,"Mississippi attorneys Wes and Mary Grace Payton have battled New York City-based Krane Chemical in an effort to seek justice for Jeannette Baker, whose husband and son died from carcinogenic pollutants the company knowingly and negligently allowed to seep into their town's water supply. When the jury awards Baker $3 million in wrongful death damages and $38 million in punitive damages, billionaire stockholder Carl Trudeau vows to do whatever is necessary to overturn their decision and save the company's stocks."
 Plot ,,"Since Mississippi Supreme Court justices are elected rather than appointed, Trudeau plots with Barry Rinehart of Troy-Hogan, a shady Boca Raton firm that deals only in judicial elections, to select a candidate who can replace the liberal Sheila McCarthy. Their anointed candidate is Ron Fisk, a lawyer with no political experience or ambitions. He is naïve enough to be impressed by the attention shown him by his backers, and does not question his source of funding or his campaign team's underhanded tactics."
 Plot ,,"Rinehart also uses Clete Coley, a clownish third party candidate, to draw support away from McCarthy and then cede it to Fisk when he eventually withdraws from the race. Fisk defeats McCarthy and immediately votes against upholding several large settlements in cases brought before the court on appeal, and the Paytons expect he will do the same when their case comes up for review. What they do not anticipate is Fisk unexpectedly being forced to rethink his stance when his son is critically and injured by a defective product and left permanently impaired by a medical error."
 Plot ,,"The issue of corporate responsibility affects him and his family on a personal level. However, even though Fisk is aware that he has been used and tricked, he ultimately reverts the verdict against Krane, as he acknowledges also that changing positions due to his personal tragedy would be an act more compromising of his judicial integrity. Fisk also refuses to take legal action for what happened to his son due to fears of appearing hypocritical, but confirms a less-important verdict concerning medical neglect, implying his judicial philosophy may yet change over time."

 Geology ,,"The site's geology broadly comprises glacial deposits 4.5–7.6 m (15–25 ft) deep overlying bedrock, with some areas overlain with peat to a depth of 1.5–9.2 m (4.9–30.2 ft). The bedrock was formed during the Triassic-Jurassic period and consists mainly of sandstone, greywacke, shale and conglomerate. Groundwater in the area is produced from both the bedrock and shallow aquifers. The water table is at or near the surface for most of the year, and the area is generally low and swampy. The Superfund site consists of 9.4 acres and straddles the border between Norton and Attleboro."
 Geology ,,"Approximately 6.0 acres in Norton were owned by the Shpack family who operated it as a landfill. This land was purchased by the town's Norton Conservation Commission in 1981 in order to facilitate remediation. The adjoining 3.4 acres are located in Attleboro and are part of a separate landfill operation owned by Attleboro Landfill Inc (ALI). The site is mostly level and was formerly a flat wetlands area. The site is bounded in the north by Peckham Street/Union Road, by Chartley Swamp in the south and east, and by the ALI landfill in the west."
 Geology ,,"The Shpack landfill was situated on land owned by Isadore and Lea Shpack. Isadore Shpack, a Russian Jewish immigrant and retired New York City municipal employee, began allowing dumping on the property in an effort to fill in its swamp. He then planned to raise an orchard and cultivate vegetables on the reclaimed land. Shpack allowed completely unregulated dumping and is reported locally to have accepted any type of waste which was refused by the neighbouring municipal landfill.The ALI landfill was originally Attleboro's municipal dump from the 1940s until 1975. In 1975 it was purchased by Attleboro Landfill Inc."
 Geology ,,which continued to use it as a landfill until 1995.
 History , Discovery of contamination ,"In 1978 John Sullivan, a 20-year-old local resident who was also a student at the Florida Institute of Technology, became curious about why snails in the area were losing their shells. He visited the Shpack site with a Geiger counter which detected a high level of radiation emissions. Initially ""ridiculed"" about his claim of discovering radioactivity at the dump, Sullivan contacted the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) which then carried out its own investigation and confirmed the presence of radioactivity. The site was found to contain radium-226, radium-228, uranium-235, uranium-236 and uranium-238."
 History , Discovery of contamination ,"The presence of Uranium-236 was indicative of reprocessed reactor fuel being dumped at the site, and testing of Uranium-235 samples demonstrated enrichment as high as 76%. A second survey was conducted in 1980 by Oak Ridge National Laboratory as a result of which the site was designated for remedial action under the U.S. Department of Energy's Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP)."
 History , Discovery of contamination ,"FUSRAP is used to remediate or control sites ""where radioactive contamination remains from the early years of the nation's atomic energy program.""Further surveys of the site uncovered extensive contamination with chemical wastes which had been dumped ""in both bulk and containerized forms."" The metal drums which originally contained the wastes had been emptied, burned and left on the surface of the site. Contaminants included volatile organic compounds (VOCs), heavy metals (e.g. nickel, cadmium, copper, lead and mercury), dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)."
 History , Discovery of contamination ,"In 1980 the Department Of Energy conducted an emergency cleanup of the site and removed approximately 900 lb of radioactive waste. In 1986 the site was listed as a Superfund site by the EPA. Further studies of the site were carried out during 1992-1993 although no remediation action took place. During 2000-2002 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - which had taken over the FUSRAP program in 1998 - performed ""fieldwork"" to prepare for a radiological survey and in 2004 the EPA put forward a cleanup plan."
 History , Discovery of contamination ,"The project, estimated to cost $43 million, proposed the removal and disposal of 35,000 yd³ (26,759 m3) of radioactive soil by the Army Corps of Engineers, with a second phase during which the EPA would remove the chemical wastes. Work was expected to begin in early 2005 and be completed by 2006.Remediation eventually commenced in August 2005 but ceased in July 2006 due to lack of funds. During this time, the Army Corps of Engineers removed 2,700 yd (2,500 m)3) of contaminated soil."
 Cleanup action , Potentially Responsible Parties ,"On August 15, 2006, the EPA issued special notice letters to fourteen Potentially Responsible Parties (PRP). A PRP is ""any individual or company potentially responsible for, or contributing to a spill or other contamination at a Superfund site."" In 2009, the following parties signed a consent decree to undertake remediation at the site: City of Attleboro Avnet Bank of America (as trustee of the Lloyd G."

Texas Instruments Waste Management of Massachusetts Inc.Under the terms of the decree the PRPs would be responsible for funding the remainder of the cleanup at an estimated cost of $29 million.
 Cleanup action , Potentially Responsible Parties ,"The Town of Norton would not be held financially liable for cleanup costs, but would instead provide access to the site.Texas Instruments (TI) subsequently filed a complaint alleging that liability for the disposal of radioactive materials relating to its work for the Atomic Energy Commission was subject to indemnity by the Department of Energy. The U.S. Department of Justice then commenced a lawsuit against TI on behalf of the Corps of Engineers, which TI settled in November 2012. TI agreed to pay $15 million towards remediation of the site, without acknowledging liability. The payment went to the Corps of Engineers."

 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"On February 14, 2002, President George W. Bush announced the Clear Skies Initiative.[1] The policy was put together by Jim Connaughton, Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, and involved the work of Senators Bob Smith and George Voinovich and Congressmen Billy Tauzin and Joe Barton. The Initiative is based on a central idea: ""that economic growth is key to environmental progress, because it is growth that provides the resources for investment in clean technologies."" The resulting proposal was a market-based cap-and-trade approach which intends to legislate power plant emissions caps without specifying the specific methods used to reach those caps."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"The Initiative would reduce the cost and complexity of compliance and the need for litigation. Current power plant emissions amounted to 67% of all sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions (in the United States), 37% of mercury emissions, and 25% of all nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Only SO2 has been administered under a cap-and-trade program. The goals of the Initiative are threefold: Cut SO2 emissions by 73%, from emissions of 11 million tons to a cap of 4.5 million tons in 2010, and 3 million tons in 2018."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"Cut NOx emissions by 67%, from emissions of 5 million tons to a cap of 2.1 million tons in 2008, and to 1.7 million tons in 2018. Cut mercury emissions by 69%, from emissions of 48 tons to a cap of 26 tons in 2010, and 15 tons in 2018. Actual emissions caps would be set to account for different air quality needs in the East and West.Through the use of a market-based cap-and-trade program, the intent of the Initiative was to reward innovation, reduce costs, and guarantee results."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"Each power plant facility would be required to have a permit for each ton of pollution emitted. Because the permits are tradeable, companies would have a financial incentive to cut back their emissions using newer technologies. The Initiative was modeled on the successful SO2 emissions trading program in effect since 1995. According to the President, the program had reduced air pollution more than all other programs under the Clean Air Act of 1990 combined. Actual reductions were more than the law required and compliance was virtually 100% without the need for litigation."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"Also, he said that only a ""handful"" of employees were needed to administer the program. The total cost to achieve the reductions was about 80% less than had originally been expected. Bush mentioned several benefits of the Initiative: Reduces respiratory and cardiovascular diseases by dramatically reducing smog, fine particles, and regional haze. Protects wildlife, habitats and ecosystem health from acid rain, nitrogen and mercury deposition. Cuts pollution further, faster, cheaper, and with more certainty—replacing a cycle of endless litigation with rapid and certain improvements in air quality."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"Saves as much as $1 billion annually in compliance costs that are passed along to consumers. Protects the reliability and affordability of electricity. Encourages use of new and cleaner pollution control technologies. In May 2004, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) released a study comparing the Clear Skies Act with the Clean Air Planning Act of 2003 (S. 843), introduced by Senator Thomas R. Carper, and the Clean Power Act of 2003 (S. 366), introduced by Senator James Jeffords."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"The differences between the three bills are summarized as follows: Carbon dioxide emissions: While all three bills implement emissions targets on power sector emissions of NOx, SO2, and mercury, the Clean Air Planning Act and the Clean Power Act also call for limits on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Under the Clean Air Planning Act, greenhouse gas emission reductions outside of the power sector, referred to as offsets, can be used to meet the emission targets for CO2."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"Size of generators covered: All three bills cover emissions from larger generators that generate power for sale, including central station generators and generators at customer sites that sell power they do not use for their own needs. The Clear Skies and Clean Air Planning Acts cover generating facilities 25 megawatts and larger, while the Clean Power Act covers facilities 15 megawatts and larger. The bills have differing provisions regarding the coverage of combined heat and power facilities that generate some power for sale. Emissions caps: The bills generally rely on emissions cap and trade programs to achieve the required reductions."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"Under such programs, allowances will be allocated and covered generators will have to submit one allowance for each unit of emissions they produce. However, for mercury, the Clean Air Planning Act combines a minimum removal target for all plants with an emissions cap, and the Clean Power Act specifies a maximum emissions rate for all facilities and allows no trading of mercury allowances."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"The Clear Skies Act contains a ""safety valve"" feature that caps the price that power companies would have to pay for mercury ($2,187.50 per ounce or $35,000 per pound), SO2 ($4,000 per ton), and NOx ($4,000 per ton) allowances. Should one or more of these ""safety valves"" be triggered, the corresponding cap on emissions would effectively be relaxed. Emissions allocation: Under the Clear Skies Act, emission allowances are to be allocated based on historical fuel consumption, what is often referred to as ""grandfathering""."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"Under the Clean Air Planning Act, a grandfathering approach is used to allocate emission allowances for SO2, but allowances for NOx, mercury, and CO2, are allocated using an output-based scheme. Under this approach, referred to as a generation performance standard (GPS), generators are given allowances for each unit of electricity they generate. The number of allowances allocated for each unit of generation changes each year as the total generation from covered sources changes. The use of a GPS dampens the electricity price impacts of the bill but raises overall compliance costs."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"Control technology: In addition to the emission caps, the Clean Power Act also requires that all plants have the best available control technology (BACT) beginning in 2014 or when they reach 40 years of age, whichever comes later. This provision, often referred to as a ""birthday"" provision, requires older plants to add controls even if the total emissions of covered facilities are below the emission caps. The law reduces air pollution controls, including those environmental protections of the Clean Air Act, including caps on toxins in the air and budget cuts for enforcement."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"The Act is opposed by conservationist groups such as the Sierra Club with Henry A. Waxman, a Democratic congressman of California, describing its title as ""clear propaganda."" Among other things, the Clear Skies Act: Allows 42 million more tons of pollution emitted than the EPA proposal. Weakens the current cap on nitrogen oxide pollution levels from 1.25 million tons to 2.1 million tons, allowing 68% more NOx pollution. Delays the improvement of sulfur dioxide (SO2) pollution levels compared to the Clean Air Act requirements."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"Delays enforcement of smog-and-soot pollution standards until 2015.By 2018, the Clear Skies Act will supposedly allow 3 million tons more NOx through 2012 and 8 million more by 2020, for SO2, 18 million tons more through 2012 and 34 million tons more through 2020. 58 tons more mercury through 2012 and 163 tons more through 2020 would be released into the environment than what would be allowed by enforcement of the Clean Air Act.[2] In August 2001, the EPA proposed a version of the Clear Skies Act that contained short timetables and lower emissions caps [3]."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"It is unknown why this proposal was withdrawn and replaced with the Bush administration proposal. It is also unclear whether or not the original EPA proposal would have made it out of committee. In addition, some opponents consider the term, ""Clear Skies Initiative"" (similarly to the Healthy Forests Initiative), to be an example of administration Orwellian Doublespeak, using environmentally friendly terminology as ""cover"" for a give-away to business interests. Proponents for the CSA argue that the Clean Air Act sets unachievable goals, especially for ozone and nitrogen oxide pollution."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"Having a clearly defined cap will benefit both industry and the general population because the goals are visible to everyone and industry benefits from cost-certainty. For example, the claim that simply enforcing the Clean Air Act will result in less pollution than the Clear Skies Act assumes that strict measures will be taken in heavily polluting areas, such as Los Angeles and other municipalities. Measures such as transportation control were taken in the 1970s but were withdrawn amid widespread public protest."
 Background: The Clear Skies Initiative ,,"Proponents of reform argue that a more likely result of following the current Clean Air Act is the continued 'muddling along' approach to environmental legislation, with most important decisions made in courts on a case-by-case basis after many years of litigation."

 Revolving structure ,,"All 50 states, plus Puerto Rico operate a CWSRF. The 51 CWSRF programs function like environmental infrastructure banks by distributing low interest rate loans for water quality projects. Loan repayments are recycled back into individual CWSRF programs. States can only use the funds to make loans, purchase local debt, or issue financial guarantees. They cannot make grants or otherwise dissipate the capital in their funds. Principal repayments plus interest earnings become available to finance new projects, allowing the funds to ""revolve"" over time. States can also increase their CWSRF financing capacity by issuing CWSRF-backed revenue or general obligation bonds."
 Revolving structure ,,"As of 2007, 27 states have leveraged their programs in this way, raising an additional $20.6 billion for important water quality projects.The 51 funds are capitalized in part by federal and state contributions. For every dollar contributed by the federal government, states contribute 20 cents. As of 2017, the cumulative federal appropriation to the 51 CWSRF programs had reached over $42 billion, with corresponding state contributions of $84 billion. Financial leveraging techniques conducted by state funds had snowballed federal and state contributions into $153 billion in 2021.States are responsible for the operation of their CWSRF program."
 Revolving structure ,,"Under the CWSRF, states may provide various types of assistance, including loans, refinancing, purchasing, or guaranteeing local debt and purchasing bond insurance. States may also set specific loan terms, including interest rates from zero percent to market rate and repayment periods of up to 30 years. States have the flexibility to target financial resources to their specific community and environmental needs.States may customize loan terms to meet the needs of small and disadvantaged communities, or to provide incentives for certain types of projects."
 Revolving structure ,,"Beginning in 2009, Congress authorized the CWSRFs to provide further financial assistance through additional subsidization, such as grants, principal forgiveness, and negative interest rate loans. Through the Green Project Reserve, the CWSRFs target critical green infrastructure, water and energy efficiency improvements, and other environmentally innovative activities. Since the inaugural CWSRF project was funded in 1988, the 51 state-run CWSRF programs have provided over $145 billion in assistance for water quality projects through 38,441 loans. In 2017, the programs provided over $7.4 billion in assistance to loan recipients of all sizes, including farmers, homeowners, small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and major municipalities."
 Revolving structure ,,"In 2017 the average loan interest rate was 1.4%, compared to the prevailing market rate of 3.5%.While wastewater treatment projects have comprised 96 percent of all CWSRF funding to date, over $4.6 billion has gone to nonpoint source and estuary projects. The number of assistance agreements for nonpoint source projects has grown significantly over the years, from only two projects in 1990 to 1,305 in 2007. The low cost and flexibility of CWSRF financing has helped the programs serve communities of all sizes. In 2007, two-thirds of all loans went to communities with populations below 3,500."
 Revolving structure ,,"In addition, over $1.1 billion in assistance targeted communities with fewer than 10,000 people (see Figure 3).The programs are projected to continue to grow over time, as interest earnings and repayments of loans increase (see Figure 4). Nationally, the CWSRF program provides a remarkable return on federal investment: as of 2017, the program has financed $3 in projects for every dollar the federal government has invested.The demand for CWSRF funds nationwide can be attributed to high needs, low interest rates, and flexible financing options."
 Revolving structure ,,"The rate of fund utilization has increased steadily since 1988, signaling increased demand for funds as well as efficient state operations. As of 2007, 97 percent of all available funds were committed to projects. To meet high levels of demand, 27 states have chosen to implement leveraging approaches by issuing revenue and general obligation bonds that are secured by CWSRF assets. Through leveraging, states have increased their capacity to finance important water quality projects."
 Program highlights , The use of leveraging in the CWSRF ,"27 CWSRF's leverage their funds to increase the amount of capital available for loan assistance. This means that these states augment their CWSRF capital by issuing municipal bonds. Typically, they loan the proceeds of the bonds while investing their capitalization funds (both state and federal). These investments serve two purposes. First, they are pledged to the bondholders as additional collateral, thus more than assuring a AAA bond rating. Second, the interest on the invested capital is used to pay subsidies to the CWSRF program's local utility borrowers."
 Program highlights , CWSRF Benefits Reporting System ,"The CWSRF Benefits Reporting System (CBR), launched in 2005 and adopted by all 51 state programs, produces a quantifiable record of the environmental and public health impact of CWSRF investments. Figures 6 and 8 present data reported in the CBR System to date. CBR allows users to record anticipated water quality improvements from every CWSRF loan directed towards water quality improvement. The 51 state programs have used CBR to track the environmental impact of 4,878 projects. The data link $15.8 billion in CWSRF loans to projects that protect and restore drinking water sources, recreational areas, and aquatic wildlife throughout the country."
 Program highlights , CWSRF Benefits Reporting System ,"In 2007, CWSRF programs funded more than 964 projects designed to protect and restore water bodies, including 597 projects with direct human health benefits. Clean Water Act sections 212, 319, and 320 provide the statutory authority for programs funded by the CWSRF. The CWSRF is authorized to provide financial assistance for the construction of publicly owned treatment works (sec. 212), the development and execution of state's comprehensive conservation management plans (sec. 319), and the development and execution of an estuary conservation and management plan (sec. 320)."

 Statutory authority , Eligibility ,"Planting trees and shrubs within the watershed (drainage basin) Purchasing equipment required for the CCMP Environmental clean-up Development and initial delivery of educational programs.Projects must have a direct benefit to the water quality of an estuary. This includes: Protection of public water supplies Protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife Actions that, in order to allow for recreational activities in and on water, require the control of point and nonpoint sources of pollution to supplement existing controls of pollution.In many cases, estuary level protection plans are combined with other elements of an overall project."
 Statutory authority , Eligibility ,"Where the water quality portion of a project is clearly distinct from other portions of the project, only the water quality portion can be funded by the CWSRF."
 Statutory authority , Eligible use of funds ,"The CWSRF employs a variety of loan assistance mechanisms. LoansTerms may not exceed 20 years. Interest rates must be at or below market rate including interest-free.Purchase of debt or refinanceA community's debt may be purchased by an SRF program. Under the Extended Term Finance Policy, the purchase may have terms greater than 20 years, up to the useful life of the project. Targeted to disadvantaged communities, though a waiver of the restriction may be granted."
 Statutory authority , Eligible use of funds ,An SRF program may refinance previously issued debt.Guarantees and insurancesGuarantees or insurance can be used where such assistance will result in improved credit market access or reduced interest rates. The SRF program does not disburse funds for construction; such funds are procured by a borrower in the market.Guarantee SRF revenue debtSection 603(d)(3) of the Act authorizes CWSRF's to guaranty debt. Guaranty powers increase the funding capacity of CWSRF's as well as decrease annual payments which utility ratepayers must pay for their wastewater projects. Guaranties work very much like municipal bond insurance. SRF programs may issue debt guaranteed by SRF funds.
 Statutory authority , Eligible use of funds ,"The revenue generated is used to provide assistance to borrowers for eligible projects. This greatly expands the capacity of a program in the near-term.Provide loan guaranteesSimilar revolving funds established by municipalities or inter-municipal agencies can receive loan guarantees.Additional SubsidizationUnder certain conditions, CWSRF programs may provide up to a fixed percentage of their capitalization grants as additional subsidization in the form of principal forgiveness, negative interest rate loans, or grants. The recipient must be a municipality or inter-municipal, interstate, or state agency."
 Statutory authority , Eligible use of funds ,"Additional subsidization may only be used to help address affordability issues or to implement a process, material, technique, or technology that addresses water or energy efficiency goals; mitigates stormwater runoff; or encourages sustainable project planning, design, and construction.Earn InterestCWSRFs may invest available funds in short-term investments. All interest earnings must remain in the fund to be used for eligible purposes."
 Statutory authority , Eligible use of funds ,"Due to the income stream into the program from state match, loan repayments, interest earnings, investment earning, and bond proceeds from leveraging, the return on every federal dollar investment to the CWSRF is currently $3 as of 2017.EPA has projected that over a twenty-year time horizon, the initial federal investment into the CWSRF can result in the construction of up to three to four times as many projects compared to programs that utilize a one-time federal grant, depending on the allocation of resources to the program. Climate change threatens both water quality and water quantity."
 Statutory authority , Eligible use of funds ,The CWSRF can assist water utilities and municipalities mitigate the effects of climate change as they relate to water quality by capitalizing costs related to planning and implementing new technologies. Eligible criteria include the following.
 Addressing climate change , Energy conservation ,"Wastewater and stormwater treatment facilities consume energy to collect and distribute treated water. The CWSRF can fund capital costs needed to power these publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) and strongly encourages the implementation of energy efficient technology. Energy efficient pumps Clean energy technology (e.g., solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal) Purchase of energy audits that have a reasonable prospect of resulting in a capital project Pro-rata share of capital costs for off-site publicly owned clean energy facilities that provides power to POTWs."
 Addressing climate change , Green infrastructure ,"The CWSRF can fund the ""capital costs"" of green infrastructure projects with direct water quality benefits. Capital costs include traditional infrastructure expenditures (such as pipes, pumps and treatment plants), as well as unconventional infrastructure costs (like land conservation, tree plantings, equipment purchases, planning and design, environmental cleanups and even the development and initial delivery of environmental education programs). One of the few things the CWSRF cannot fund is the operation and maintenance costs of a project.The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 established additional financing mechanisms and includes eligibility for green infrastructure projects."
 Addressing climate change , Carbon sequestration ,"The CWSRF can finance carbon sequestration through a variety of methods, including urban heat-island reduction, energy saving achievement, and habitat preservation. Aquatic environments, green spaces, and geologic carbon storage are efficient carbon sinks that can be utilized with CWSRF loans. Wetlands restoration Land conservation (purchase of easements and preserved green spaces) Tree plantings (reforestation, green roofs, tree boxes, parks, vegetated swales and median strips) CO2 scrubbers on power plants that provide energy to POTWs."
 Addressing climate change , Methane capture ,"Publicly owned equipment for the capture of methane emitted from an anaerobic municipal wastewater treatment system and conversion to energy is eligible for CWSRF funding. Methane capture equipment can be privately owned if the project is located within a designated National Estuary. Public or privately owned equipment to capture methane emitted from manure-containing ponds on animal feeding operations (AFOs), not regulated as concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), and convert the methane to energy is eligible for CWSRF funding. This equipment can be located at CAFOs in designated National Estuaries."

 Addressing climate change , Methane capture ,"Public-private partnerships, or ""P3s"", are one investment technique by which municipalities can finance the upgrade, expansion, repair, or implementation of new technology for wastewater infrastructure. The CWSRF, because of its unique financing authorities, is authorized to oversee (in concert with the EPA's Assistant Administrator for Water), provide technical assistance, and guidance for municipalities that choose to investigate P3s for the provision of their wastewater services."
 Addressing climate change , Methane capture ,"A P3, as defined by the Environmental Financial Advisory Board, is a contractual, institutional, or other relationship between government and a private sector entity that results in sharing of duties, risks, and rewards of providing a service in which the government has an interest, recognizing that the government retains ultimate responsibility for insuring that social needs and objectives are met.P3s are sought by states and local governments as a way to reduce the financial burden of water pollution and infrastructure needs."
 Addressing climate change , Methane capture ,"It has been estimated that, of the costly capital improvements, upgrades, expansions, and new compliance requirements imposed on water and wastewater utilities, local governments bear 95% of the costs. Among local government expenditures, only education is higher. Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA) to provide an expanded credit program for water and wastewater infrastructure projects, with broader eligibility criteria than the previously authorized revolving funds for wastewater and drinking water."
 Addressing climate change , Methane capture ,"Pursuant to the act, EPA established its Water Infrastructure and Resiliency Finance Center in 2015 to help local governments and municipal utilities design innovative financing mechanisms, including public-private partnerships.

 Facilities ,,"The 920-acre (1.44 sq mi; 3.7 km2) Cedar Hills Regional Landfill is located 9 miles (14 km) southeast of Renton near Maple Valley. The landfill is divided between nine areas that have been continually expanded since the 1980s. The facility continues to take in 2,500 short tons (2,300,000 kg) of garbage delivered by 130 trucks from the county's transfer facilities. A bioenergy plant uses collected methane from the landfill to produce electricity for the Puget Sound Energy grid. The state government originally owned the undeveloped Cedar Hills site and signed a 40-year lease with King County in 1960."
 Facilities ,,"The site was divided between a central landfill, established in 1964, and a rehabilitation center for alcoholics. The central facility at Cedar Hills replaced a system of 16 open landfills that were operated by the county until the late 1960s. The facility was initially expected to handle the county's garbage needs for up to 40–50 years, but the addition of a contract with the City of Seattle caused capacity concerns by the late 1960s. The county government paid $350,000 to acquire a high-density compactor in 1968 that doubled capacity at Cedar Hills."
 Facilities ,,"The machine compressed garbage into a tenth of its original volume and deposited bales of compressed garbage into open trenches.King County operated several other landfills, including a ""backup"" site for Cedar Hills near Issaquah, but they ceased operations in the 1980s in favor of expanding Cedar Hills. The City of Seattle diverted its garbage to the Midway Landfill in Kent in the mid-1970s, but returned to Cedar Hills in 1987."
 Facilities ,,"To reduce the burden of garbage disposal at Cedar Hills, Puget Sound Energy proposed the construction of a waste-to-energy incineration plant in 1980, but the proposal was repeatedly declined by the county government. A nearby composting facility was opened by a private operator in 1989.Cedar Hills was designated as a high-risk hazardous site by the Washington State Department of Ecology in 1992 due to the presence of arsenic, lead, and benzene in groundwater. As of 2016, liquids from the oldest sections of the landfill are anticipated to seep into an underground aquifer by 2058."
 Facilities ,,"The landfill is also home to a population of bald eagles, ravens, crows, and seagulls who pick up garbage and drop pieces in surrounding neighborhoods. The county government uses fireworks and other countermeasures to deter the birds, and have sought permission to use similar tactics against the bald eagles."
 History , Settlement ,"Gold was initially discovered in the early 1860s in the mountains to the north of the Snake River basin, which gave way to a large influx of prospectors. Silver, copper, and other minerals were subsequently discovered. Idaho experienced boom after boom, and mining towns arose overnight, boomed, and then disappeared as the miners left for the latest rush. In 1884, miners discovered significant amounts of silver, zinc, and lead at the Tiger Mine in Burke Canyon. The Tiger Mine was sold to S.S."
 History , Settlement ,"Glidden for $35,000.In 1887, Glidden began construction on a three-foot-wide railway to transport hardrock ore out of the Tiger Mine. Meanwhile, a buildup of 100,000 pounds (45,000 kg) of ore had accumulated from the various mines in the canyon, leading to the establishment of the Canyon Creek Railroad, which had its first shipment to Wallace on December 12, 1887. The establishment of the railroad coincided with that of the town of Burke, from which the canyon takes its name. Burke was the largest mining community in the canyon, with a peak population of 1,400 in 1910."
 History , Settlement ,"The community of Gem, just south of Burke, had been established in 1886. Both Gem and Burke attracted various miners as well as a large number of Swedish immigrants.By 1903, Burke Canyon was the most developed mining region in the Coeur d'Alene Mountains and was home to seven dividend-paying mines: the Gem of the Mountains, Frisco, Mammoth, Standard, Hecla, Tiger-Poorman and Hercules mines."
 History , Civil unrest and natural disasters ,"On July 10, 1892, miners called a strike which developed into a shooting war between union miners and company guards. The first shots fired were exchanged at the Frisco mine in the early morning hours of July 11. The gunfire ignited a stock of dynamite in the Frisco Mill, causing the four-story mill to explode and kill six people. The violence soon spilled over into the community of Gem."
 History , Civil unrest and natural disasters ,"From there, union miners who had successfully shut down both the Frisco and the Gem mines travelled west, to the Bunker Hill mining complex near Wardner, and closed down that facility as well. The Idaho National Guard and federal troops were dispatched to the area. The incident marked the first violent confrontation between the workers of the mines and their owners. Hostilities would erupt at the Bunker Hill facility once again in 1899. In both disputes, issues included pay, hours of work, the right of miners to belong to the union, and the mine owners' use of informants and undercover agents."
 History , Civil unrest and natural disasters ,"Violence committed by union miners was answered with a brutal response in 1892 and in 1899. Burke Canyon was the site of several natural disasters as well. Two major avalanches struck the canyon in the twentieth century: one on February 4, 1890, which killed three; and another in February 1910, which buried and killed twenty-five people. In the days after the February 1910 avalanche, snow and rock continued to dislodge from the canyon walls, inflicting additional damage on the towns of Burke and Mace, and causing numerous deaths."
 History , Civil unrest and natural disasters ,"In August of that year, the Great Fire of 1910 would cause further damage to the communities in the canyon. Three years later, in May 1913, the communities were stricken by heavy rains that resulted in significant floods.The Northern Pacific railroad considered discontinuing service through the canyon after the depot was damaged in a July 1923 fire. The railroad also cited increased automobile traffic as a reason for discontinuing the line. By 1939, the rail to Burke had been officially closed, and the tracks dismantled."
 History , 1980s–present ,"By the late twentieth century, mining operations in Burke Canyon had slowed considerably. The Hecla Mine in Burke officially ceased operations on June 30, 1983, due to low metal prices. The last mine in Burke officially closed in 1991, and the town and several of the surrounding communities became ghost towns. Around 2010, the Hecla Mining Company has been exploring the potential of exploiting additional resource deposits in the Star mine."
 History , 1980s–present ,"As of December 2012, Hecla invested $7 million in rehabilitation and exploration with published estimates suggesting the potential to recover in excess of 25 million ounces of silver from the site with significant zinc and lead deposits also present. The structure of Burke Canyon resembles a narrow gulch, roughly 300 feet (90 m) across, with steep cliffs and hills on both sides. The hillsides of the canyon are so steep that the community of Burke only receives around 3 hours of full sunlight during winters."
 Geography , Climate ,"Burke Canyon experiences a continental climate, marked by warm summers and cold, snowy winters. In 2002, it was reported that around 300 people lived in or near the canyon. There are numerous communities and former communities located along Burke-Canyon Road in Burke Canyon, though several are now ghost towns. The communities include:"
 Environmental concerns , Mining effects ,"Decades' worth of mining activity resulted in various metals leaching into Canyon Creek, contaminating much of Burke Canyon. Leftover waste rock from mines leached cadmium, lead, arsenic, and zinc into the creekbed. Ecologists found that long stretches of Canyon Creek were entirely uninhabited by fish due to the high levels of metal content in the water. Canyon Creek is considered one of the Coeur d'Alene basin's Superfund sites. The metals leached in Canyon Creek were partially responsible for the contamination of the Coeur d'Alene River, the most heavy-metal contaminated river in the world."
 Environmental concerns , Mining effects ,"In 2010, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moved forward with plans to dispose of leftover rock piles and contaminated soil in Burke Canyon.Various metals also impacted the local water supply of Burke Canyon: After the closure of the last mine in Burke in 1991, residents' water supplies continued to be sourced from pipes that extended into abandoned mine shafts. Consequently, the metal content of Burke's water supply was fifty times above that of federal water quality standards.In 2001, the EPA offered to buy out residents of Burke Canyon, citing water contamination in Canyon Creek, but residents refused."
 Environmental concerns , Mining effects ,"The following year, the EPA ordered the town of Burke to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act; however, given the small number of homes within the boundaries of the town, it would have cost each household an estimated $48,000 per year."
 Environmental concerns , Waste disposal ,"For decades, raw sewage was emptied via pipelines directly into Canyon Creek from the residences in Burke Canyon. By the turn of the twenty-first century, citizens of Burke had continued to dump up to 6,000 US gallons (23,000 L) of raw sewage into Canyon Creek per day. In 2004, the Panhandle Health District (PHD) and Idaho Department of Environmental Equality (DEQ) tested homes in Burke to identify contaminations, finding a total of thirty occupied homes discharging untreated waste into the creek."
 Environmental concerns , Waste disposal ,"In 2007, the DEQ sequestered $220,000 in order to help residents install new septic systems to prevent further contamination.In 2016, the EPA announced its plan to construct a waste repository in lower Burke Canyon in order to alleviate waste accumulation in Wallace. Some residents of the canyon objected to the repository, citing further pollution from diesel trucks used to transport waste in the canyon.

 Background ,,"The Dave Matthews Band had booked rooms at the Peninsula Hotel of 108 E. Superior Street for a two-night show at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy, Wisconsin. The incident occurred between the first and second night of the concert. The band booked five buses for its show; Stefan Wohl drove the bus of the band's violinist Boyd Tinsley. During warm months, the Chicago Architecture Center offers a boat tour of the buildings along the Chicago River. The boats have open-roof seating, where passengers sit during the tour."
 Background ,,"Most Chicago bridges feature riveted grating, which is used for its strength and anti-slip properties. Riveted grating allows rain, snow, and other liquids to pass through, removing the need for complicated drainage systems or to salt the bridge deck during snow, and assuring it does not ice over in wintry weather. On Sunday, August 8, 2004, at 1:18 p.m., Wohl was alone in Tinsley's bus and driving to a downtown hotel when he emptied the bus' blackwater tank as it crossed the metal grates of the Kinzie Street bridge.Passenger boat Chicago's Little Lady was hosting the 1 p.m."
 Background ,,"Chicago Architecture Foundation tour of the Chicago River. While passing under the bridge, the boat received the full contents of the tank on the seats of its open-roof terrace. Roughly two-thirds of the 120 passengers aboard the tour boat were soaked. The boat immediately returned to its dock, where all passengers were issued refunds. Five passengers went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for testing. According to the Illinois Attorney General, passengers aboard included persons with disabilities, elderly, a pregnant woman, a small child, and an infant."
 Background ,,"The filing describes the incident: The liquid waste was brownish yellow in color, and had a foul, offensive odor. The liquid human waste went into passengers' eyes, mouths, hair, and onto clothing and personal belongings, many of which were soaked. Some of the passengers suffered nausea and vomiting as a result of exposure to the human waste. The boat's deck was swabbed by its crew, and service was resumed for its scheduled 3 p.m. tour. Immediately following the incident, the Chicago Police Department said they were investigating the incident but did not yet consider it a crime."
 Background ,,"On August 9, the Chicago Architecture Foundation released a statement that a witness had recorded license plate information, which they had turned over to the police as evidence. On August 10, bus driver Jerry Fitzpatrick, who drove for the band, was identified as the owner of the bus's license plate. In a phone interview, Fitzpatrick denied to a Chicago Tribune reporter that he had dumped the waste, asserting that he was parked in front of the band's hotel at the time."
 Background ,,"A publicist for the Dave Matthews Band issued a statement saying the band's management had determined that every one of its buses was parked at the time of the incident.Fitzpatrick, who was in Effingham, Illinois, at the time, instructed Sgt. Paul Gardner of the Effingham Police Department to inspect the bus's septic tank to prove that he could not have emptied it."
 Background ,,"Gardner reported to the Chicago Tribune over Fitzpatrick's cell phone that he had inspected the tank, and that it was nearly full.State prosecutors worked with a nearby fitness gym, the East Bank Club, to identify the offending bus based on the gym's security videotapes. On August 24, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed a $70,000 lawsuit against Wohl, alleging that he was responsible for the dumping. Wohl denied dumping the waste, and was supported by the band. On August 25, Mayor Richard M. Daley held a press conference in which he released the videotape used as evidence."
 Background ,,"Daley, himself a fan of the band, expressed his belief that the dumping was ""absolutely unacceptable"".In March 2005, Wohl pleaded guilty to reckless conduct and discharging contaminants to cause water pollution. The Dave Matthews Band did not immediately apologize for previously supporting Wohl. He was sentenced to 150 hours of community service, fined $10,000 to be paid to Friends of the Chicago River, an environmental organization, and received 18 months probation. The Dave Matthews Band donated $50,000 to the Chicago Park District, $50,000 to Friends of the Chicago River, and paid the State of Illinois $200,000 in settlement."
 Background ,,"The Dave Matthews Band agreed to keep a log of when and where its buses empty their septic tanks.It is believed that Wohl did not realize that there was a boat underneath the bridge when he dumped the waste. No passengers suffered any long-lasting physical health effects from having the waste dumped on them.On August 8, 2023, the Riot Fest Historical Society attached a plaque to the Kinzie Street Bridge commemorating the 19th anniversary of the incident."
 History ,,"The West Lake Landfill site originated in 1939 as a limestone quarry operated by the Westlake Quarry Company. Landfilling at the site began in the 1950s.In 1973, after having changed hands (and responsible oversight) several times, B&K Construction Co., a company contracted by Cotter Corporation, dumped a portion of the original stored radioactive material at a nearby storage facility. 8,700 short tons (7,900 tonnes) of leached barium sulfate, the material with the lowest relative radioactivity, was combined with 39,000 short tons (35,000 t) of topsoil to dilute the contaminated material at the landfill."
 History ,,"The leached barium sulfate was a byproduct of Mallinckrodt Chemical Works’ uranium enrichment program as a part of the Manhattan Project and later nuclear weapons production, and dumping it there was illegal."
 History ,,"Due to the discovery of the radioactive and other contaminants at the site, West Lake was proposed as a Superfund site in October 1989, and was officially listed as such a site in August 1990.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission discovered the disposal and investigated the site, publishing a report in 1977.West Lake was proposed to be a Superfund site on October 28, 1989, and the EPA placed the landfill on the National Priorities List, designating it as a Superfund site on August 30, 1990."
 History ,,"The EPA has listed four potentially responsible parties: the US Department of Energy; the Cotter Corporation; and Republic Services subsidiaries Bridgeton Landfill and Rock Road Industries. EPA directed those parties to undertake investigations and evaluations consistent with CERCLA (Superfund) guidance.After decades of investigation, including multiple studies, public meetings, and public comment periods, the EPA selected a final site cleanup plan. In 2008, the EPA announced that they would contain the contaminated sites by placing a multilayered cover over 40 acres (16 ha) of OU-1. The EPA plan also required institutional controls and monitoring of the site."
 History ,,"After receiving additional comments from environmental groups and the general public, the EPA asked the potentially responsible parties to commission a study of alternative cleanup options. The resulting supplemental feasibility study was released in 2011.In 2012, following consultation with the EPA National Remedy Review Board, the EPA asked the potentially responsible parties to gather more data and perform additional evaluations."
 History ,,"After conducting an aerial survey of the site and surrounding areas in 2013, the EPA reported that the radioactive waste remained contained within OU-1 and posed no safety risk to outlying areas.The West Lake landfill has drawn further scrutiny because of a nearby subsurface smoldering fire (in OU-2), an event located only 1,000 feet (300 m) away from OU-1. If the fire were to reach the OU-1 area of radioactive waste, the radiation risks are low.In February 2018 EPA head Scott Pruitt announced a proposed plan to remediate the West Lake Landfill."
 History ,,"Known as “Excavation Plus” or “Alternative 4,” the plan involved removing radioactively impacted material with a concentration greater than 52.9 picocuries per gram (pCi/g), to a maximum depth of 16 feet. The proposal would remove approximately 67 percent of the radioactivity from the landfill and take 5 years to implement at an estimated cost of $236 million. Potentially responsible parties, including Bridgeton Landfill LLC, Rock Road Industries Inc., Cotter Corporation, and the Department of Energy are liable for the costs of the clean-up."
 History ,,"Included in the plan is a proposal to build a cover system which will protect the community of Bridgeton for the long term. The landfill is divided into multiple sectors, within which are two operable units (OU), OU-1 and OU-2. OU-1 contains radioactive material; OU-2 has been shown to as well. OU-1 covers 940 cubic yards (720 m3) on the surface (based on soil depth of 6 inches or 150 millimeters) and 24,000 cubic yards (18,000 m3) subsurface, while OU-2 covers 8,700 cubic yards (6,700 m3) on the surface and 109,000 cubic yards (83,000 m3) subsurface.The U.S."
 History ,,"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently holds control over the West Lake Landfill. The EPA has commissioned multiple studies and reports detailing the history, status and proposed remedies of OU-1.In April 2000, the EPA released a report, ""Remedial Investigation Report West Lake Landfill Operable Unit 1,"" which detailed the history and condition of the site. The EPA released a feasibility study on OU-1 in May 2006, which evaluated possible remedial options for OU-1. The study contains a chapter detailing the site’s condition as of 2006.After these and other thorough investigations, the EPA signed a Record of Decision (ROD) for OU-1."
 History ,,"In May 2008, the EPA released its record of decision, which outlined the designated course of action for remediation, including designation of a capping system designed to contain hazardous areas, and plans for long-term monitoring of ground water. In particular, it detailed the EPA’s proposed remedy of a multilayer landfill cover over the affected areas of OU-1. The EPA commissioned a supplemental feasibility study, which followed internal agency deliberations and consideration of comments provided by interested community members."
 Status 2010-present , Studies ,"The EPA continued to receive feedback regarding the Record of Decision (ROD), and in response required that potentially responsible parties conduct a Supplemental Feasibility Study (SFS) for OU-1. The full SFS was released to the public in December 2011 The current milestones and timeline from the FDA includes: May–June 2015, initiation of gamma cone penetration testing and sonic core sampling to characterize extent of radiologically impacted material, and with fall 2015 suspense. June 2015, completion of one year of baseline off-site air monitoring data [to support eventual West Lake air monitoring conclusions]."
 Status 2010-present , Studies ,"Late summer 2015, initiation of pyrolysis testing, to determine how radioactively impacted material is effected by elevated temperatures . 2016, suspense for site characterization and conceptual site model update completion, to inform the planned further Supplemental Feasibility Study (SFS), and suspense for SFS completion . 2017, public commenting period regarding the long term remedies proposed for West Lake, and EPA finalization of changes to the 2008 ROD."
 Status 2010-present , Subsurface smoldering event ,"In December 2010, those overseeing the adjoining OU-2 landfill area, the Bridgeton Sanitary Landfill ""reported... experiencing elevated temperatures on some gas extraction wells"" and concluded that a subsurface smoldering event (SSE) had begun. SSEs are a form of chemical combustion that occur deep within a landfill and produces no visible flame or quantity of smoke, unless they reach the surface, where oxygen is abundant. They usually last for several years.In March 2013, high subsurface temperatures were measured at depths of over 150 feet covering an area of over 15 football fields."
 Status 2010-present , Subsurface smoldering event ,"Trying to excavate such a large area to put out the reaction would be difficult, if not impossible, and would most likely increase toxic fumes and the risk of the reaction breaking through to the surface."
 Status 2010-present , Isolation barrier ,"Since the discovery of the smoldering fire, Republic Services ordered an isolation barrier be built (September 2013), which will prevent smoldering sanitary waste from reaching the radioactive waste stored in OU-1.The EPA, working in conjunction with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, the US Army Corps of Engineers and others, announced a decision in December, 2015, to install a physical isolation barrier for the West Lake Landfill Superfund Site."
 Status 2010-present , Isolation barrier ,"The plan recommends the installation of other engineering controls, including cooling loops, to prevent any potential impacts in the likely event that the subsurface smoldering event came in contact with the radioactive materials on the site.Further, landfill owners plan to install a cap over the North Quarry, create trenches to capture liquid and gas underneath the cap, in addition to improving techniques used to monitor gas. There is some radioactive waste in the West Lake Landfill."
 Status 2010-present , Isolation barrier ,"An independent evaluation by Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry in 2015 concluded that it does not pose a health risk to the surrounding communities. The amount of radon gas was well below the level that causes lung cancer, groundwater near the landfill moves away from the surrounding communities and is not used for drinking water, and soil samples showed no evidence of radioactive contamination. In mid-2016 there was a movement for control of the West Lake landfill to be shifted to the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP), administered by the United States Army Corps of Engineers."
 Status 2010-present , Isolation barrier ,"FUSRAP was established in 1974 to clean up radioactive wastes resulting from early nuclear activity of the US Atomic Energy Commission. FUSRAP uses independent government scientists to conduct site studies and evaluations. After thorough evaluations are conducted, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) determines how to manage the radioactive waste. Fiscally responsible parties are not able to legally challenge this decision. FUSRAP currently controls two on-going remediation projects within the greater St. Louis metropolitan area, the St."
 Status 2010-present , Isolation barrier ,"Louis Airport Site (SLAPS) and the Hazelwood Interim Storage Site (HISS), both of which contain the same composition of radioactive waste as the West Lake Landfill.According to Steven Stockton, the corps' director of civil works, adding West Lake to the FUSRAP would not speed up remediation. In addition, key US congressional energy committee members, along with the US Army Corps of Engineers oppose a proposal by Missouri's delegation to move the landfill's oversight from the EPA Superfund to FUSRAP.

 History ,,"The company went public in 2005, when Oklahoma City-based Kerr-McGee, which had previously owned the company entirely, issued shares via an initial public offering on November 21, 2005. It became an independent company in March 2006.In the first quarter of 2006, Tronox replaced Meade Instruments on the S&P SmallCap 600 index, when Kerr-McGee distributed the rest of its stock in Tronox under its former NYSE symbol TRX.B, a class B security. TRX.B started regular-way trading on March 31, 2006. In 2008, the company's stock price declined significantly, and both classes of stock became penny stocks."
 History ,,"In September 2008, the company's stock moved from the NYSE to OTC. On 14 January 2009, Tronox filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It specified that this action did not include the company's non-USA operations.In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko Petroleum (successor to Kerr-McGee) for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from its parent corporation."
 History ,,"The environmental pollution included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.In 2009, the Huntsman Corporation announced it would buy certain of Tronox's assets, such as its factories. In late 2009, Tronox terminated this deal.Tronox emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 14, 2011."
 History ,,"Tom Casey became CEO in October 2011.On June 15, 2012, Tronox announced that it had completed the acquisition of Exxaro Mineral Sands and combined both entities under Tronox Limited, an Australian holding company. Describing the benefits of the combination, Tronox Limited CEO Tom Casey said, ""We now have the ability to sell into a lucrative titanium feedstock market while assuring our titanium dioxide customers that we have the supply to deliver quality products at reasonable prices.""In April 2014, the federal government reached a $5 billion settlement with Anadarko (successor to Kerr-McGee) in the largest environmental contamination case in American history."
 History ,,"According to one report, ""Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets."" The cost to clean up the mess inherited by Tronox from Kerr-McGee was estimated by the courts to be over $5 billion. There are contaminated sites in 22 states and the Navajo Nation."
 History ,,"""Among the dozens of locations targeted for cleanup under the settlement is a former chemical manufacturing site in Nevada that has led to contamination in Lake Mead, abandoned uranium mines in and around the Navajo Nation, and a Superfund site in Gloucester, N.J., polluted by thorium.""On 10 April 2019, Tronox acquired the Saudi Arabian titanium dioxide pigment manufacturer Cristal Global."

 Background ,,"The Six Cities study was born in the wake of the 1970s energy crisis amid growing concerns that a squeeze on oil supply would lead to greater use of low-quality coal and therefore higher mortality from air pollution. The harmful health effects of burning coal had already come to light following the 1952 Great London Smog (in the United Kingdom), the 1948 Donora tragedy (in the United States), and other major pollution episodes, but it was unclear which part of coal pollution (sulphur dioxide, particulates, or some combination of these and other emissions) was of most concern."
 Background ,,"There were also differences of scientific opinion about how particulates affected human health, which types were most harmful, and whether there were impacts even at low to moderate levels of exposure. The Harvard Six Cities study aimed to address some of these questions.As it acknowledged in its introduction, it built on a number of earlier studies that had found ""associations between mortality rates and particulate air pollution in U.S. metropolitan areas"", including a 1970 Science paper ""Air Pollution and Human Health"" by Lester Lave and Eugene Seskin of Carnegie Mellon University."
 Background ,,"Crucially, unlike the earlier studies, which were generally cross-sectional in design (statistical snapshots of large, anonymous populations taken at arbitrary times), the Harvard Six Cities was a cohort study that tracked the same people over their lives, so allowing risk factors such as age, sex, and smoking history to be eliminated, and the effects of air pollution to be studied in isolation."
 Background ,,"Dockery and colleagues studied a cohort of 8,111 adults living in six American cities ""selected as representative of the range of particulate air pollution in the United States"": Harriman, Tennessee; Portage, Wisconsin; St Louis, Missouri; Steubenville, Ohio; Topeka, Kansas and Watertown, Massachusetts. Over a decade and a half, each person was questioned on such things as their medical history and lifestyle (including whether and how much they smoked, their body mass index, their education level, average age, and so on). This data was compared with ambient air pollution measurements from the six cities and mortality data from the National Death Index."
 Background ,,"The study found that people living in the most polluted city (Steubenville) were 26 percent more likely to die than those in the least polluted city (Portage), suggesting an association between particulate pollution and higher death rates in urban areas: ""Although the effects of other, unmeasured risk factors cannot be excluded with certainty, these results suggest that fine-particulate air pollution, or a more complex pollution mixture associated with fine particulate matter, contributes to excess mortality in certain U.S."
 Background ,,"cities."" The Six Cities study was followed (and its findings effectively confirmed) by a much bigger epidemiological project, generally referred to as the American Cancer Society (ACS) study, which was carried out by three authors of the original study (Pope, Dockery, and Frank E. Speizer) and four other collaborators."
 Background ,,"The ACS study correlated air pollution data, lifestyle factors, and death records for a sample of 552,138 adults in 151 urban areas followed over a 16-year period and concluded, just as the original had done, that breathing particulate pollution increases a person's risk of death: ""Particulate air pollution was associated with cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality but not with mortality due to other causes. Increased mortality is associated with sulfate and fine particulate air pollution at levels commonly found in U.S. cities."" A variety of similar epidemiological studies have also supported the association between fine particulate pollution and higher mortality."
 Background ,,"Crucially, a 2006 paper by Francine Laden and members of the original Harvard team (Frank Speizer and Douglas Dockery) also confirmed the opposite effect: reductions in particulate pollution save lives. Following the publication of the Six Cities and ACS studies, there were new calls for tougher pollution standards in the United States and The American Lung Association ultimately sued the US Environmental Protection Agency to bring that about. As a result, in 1997, the EPA introduced National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) with new limits on particulates."
 Background ,,"This, in turn, prompted pushback from industry groups and various legal challenges, including a request to release data from the original studies for scrutiny by third parties. Medical confidentiality agreements prevented this, so, as a compromise, the studies were independently reanalyzed by Daniel Krewski, Richard Burnett, and colleagues on behalf of the Health Effects Institute, which used different statistical methods but essentially confirmed the original findings.The legal challenges were eventually settled by a Supreme Court ruling on February 27, 2001 (Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, S.Ct. No. 99-1257) that unanimously sided with the EPA."
 Background ,,"Since then, largely as a result of the initial Six Cities and ACS studies, and the follow-up research they inspired, air quality standards and guidelines for particulate pollution have been introduced throughout the world - potentially saving many millions of lives. According to air pollution scientist Gary Fuller: ""It is hard to overstate the impact of the Six Cities study on global health... the results still offer the best estimate for how much our lives are shortened by the particle pollution that we breathe."""
 Impact ," Proposed EPA ""Honest Act"" ","When then-EPA director, Scott Pruitt, announced his proposed scientific research policy requiring full transparency of all studies that inform public environmental policies, this would have excluded studies, such as the Six Cities studies, because they used confidential data in personal medical reports that could not be made openly available. Critics of Pruitt's policy traced its roots to the Harvard Six Cities study. Various iterations of the bill have been supported by American Chemistry Council, an organization that advises DuPont and Monsanto, among others. It has also been supported by Koch Industries, Peabody Energy, and ExxonMobil."
 Impact ," Proposed EPA ""Honest Act"" ","According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, some within the chemical, manufacturing and energy sector did not approve of the clean air regulations that were implemented because of the Six Cities studies, so they are trying to ""attack the science underlying the regulation"". The ""demand for transparency"" was in reality a way to ""undermine scientific independence."" The Honest and Open New E.P.A. Science Treatment Act, which was sponsored by Lamar Smith (R-Texas) provided the basis for Pruitt's plans for transparency in science policy that he announced on The Daily Caller in March 2018.

 History ,,"The Fresno Municipal Sanitary Landfill, opened in Fresno, California in 1937, is considered to have been the first modern, sanitary landfill in the United States, innovating the techniques of trenching, compacting, and the daily covering of waste with soil. It has been designated a National Historic Landmark, underlining the significance of waste disposal in urban society. The first federal legislation addressing solid waste management was the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965 (SWDA) that created a national office of solid waste. By the mid-1970s, all states had some type of solid waste management regulations. In 1976, the U.S."
 History ,,House of Representatives passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) that dramatically expanded the federal government's role in managing waste disposal.
 History ,,"RCRA divided wastes into hazardous and non-hazardous categories, and directed the EPA to develop the design and operational standards for sanitary landfills and close or upgrade existing open dumps that did not meet the sanitary landfill standards.In 1979, the EPA developed criteria for sanitary landfills that included siting restrictions in floodplains; endangered species protection; surface water protection; groundwater protection; disease and vector (rodents, birds, insects) control; opening burning prohibitions; explosive gas (methane) control; fire prevention through the use of cover materials; and prevention of bird hazards to aircraft.The RCRA was amended in 1984."
 History ,,"In 1991, the EPA established new federal standards for municipal solid waste landfills that updated location and operation standards, added design standards, groundwater monitoring requirements, corrective action requirements for known environmental releases, closure and post-closure requirements, and financial assurances to pay for landfill future care and maintenance. The EPA generally relies on the states to enforce their own operating permits and federal laws. If state agencies are not aggressive, violations can worsen, multiplying negative environmental impacts exponentially. There are some notably recorded violations in the U.S."
 History ,,"such as for a landfill in Hawaii that was fined $2.8 million in 2006 for operating violations, but this is not common.Modern landfills are specifically designed to protect human health and the environment by controlling water and air emissions. All MSWLF must comply with the federal regulations in 40 CFR Part 258, or equivalent state regulations. Some of the federal regulations in 40 CFR part 258 include: Location Restrictions - landfills must be built in suitable geological areas away from faults, wetlands, flood plains or other restricted areas."
 History ,,"Composite Liners Requirements - include a flexible membrane (geomembrane) overlaying two feet of compacted clay soil lining the bottom and sides of the landfill, protect groundwater and the underlying soil from leachate releases. Leachate Collection and Removal Systems - sit on top of the composite liner and removes leachate from the landfill for treatment and disposal. Operating Practices - including the compacting and covering of waste frequently with several inches of soil to help reduce odor; control litter, insects and rodents; and protect public health."
 History ,,"Groundwater Monitoring Requirements - testing of groundwater wells must be done to determine whether waste materials have escaped from the landfill. Closure and Postclosure Care Requirements - including covering landfills and providing long-term care of closed landfills. Corrective Action Provisions - control and cleanup of landfill releases and achieves groundwater protection standards. Financial Assurance - provides funding for environmental protection during and after landfill closure.Under Subtitle D of RCRA, states are required to adopt and implement permit programs to ensure that landfills in their states comply with relevant federal standards."
 History ,,"The law also requires EPA to determine whether state permit programs are adequate to ensure such compliance. For permit programs to be approved, states must provide opportunities for public involvement during the permit application process. This may include public meetings or submission of concerns in writing to the permitting agency."
 History ,,"In addition, states must have the power to issue permits and perform compliance monitoring and enforcement actions that ensure compliance with the federal standards.Agencies such as the Solid Waste Association of North America's (SWANA) Landfill Management Division provide training and technical advice related to the planning, design, construction, closure and post-closure of today's landfills. The division regularly monitors, reviews and comments on current legislative and regulatory actions that could potentially affect landfill operations and new technology. Waste Management, based in Houston, Texas, manages/operates five of the top 10 largest landfills and owns three of those outright. [Forbes]"
 Regulation , Leachate collection ,"Landfill leachate is generated from liquids existing in the waste as it enters a landfill or from rainwater that passes through the waste within the facility. The leachate consists of different organic and inorganic compounds that may be either dissolved or suspended. An important part of maintaining a landfill is managing the leachate through proper treatment methods designed to prevent pollution into surrounding ground and surface waters. For landfills receiving hazardous waste, permits require landfill liners and the installation of systems for collecting leachate."
 Regulation , Leachate collection ,"Based on recent EPA studies, a liner and leachate collection system constructed to current standards typically has a liquid removal efficiency of 99 to 100 percent and frequently exceeds 99.99 percent.The leachate collection system collects the leachate so that it can be removed from the landfill and properly treated or disposed. Most leachate collection systems have the following components: Leachate collection layer - a layer of sand or gravel or a thick plastic mesh called a geonet collects leachate and allows it to drain by gravity to the leachate collection pipe system."
 Regulation , Leachate collection ,"Filter Geotextile - a geotextile fabric, similar in appearance to felt, may be located at the top of the leachate collection pipe system to provide separation of solid particles from liquid. This prevents clogging of the pipe system. Leachate Collection Pipe System - Perforated pipes, surrounded by a bed of gravel, transport collected leachate to specially designed low points called sumps."
 Regulation , Leachate collection ,"Pumps, located within the sumps, automatically remove the leachate from the landfill and transport it to the leachate management facilities for treatment or another proper method of disposal.Federal requirements mandate that treatment must meet drinking water quality standards, which are set to prevent harm to public health, or more stringent state standards to protect sensitive environments (high quality streams, trout streams)."
 Regulation , Groundwater monitoring ,"Nearly all municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) are required to monitor the underlying groundwater for contamination during their active life and post-closure care period. The exceptions to this requirement are small landfills that receive less than 20 tons of solid waste per day, and facilities that can demonstrate that there is no potential for the migration of hazardous constituents from the unit into the groundwater."
 Regulation , Groundwater monitoring ,"All other MSWLFs must comply with the groundwater monitoring requirements found at 40 CFR Part 258, Subpart E–Ground-Water Monitoring and Corrective Action.The groundwater monitoring system consists of a series of wells placed upgradient and downgradient of the MSWLF. The samples from the upgradient wells shows the background concentrations of constituents in the groundwater while, the downgradient wells show the extent of groundwater contamination caused by the MSWLF."
 Regulation , Groundwater monitoring ,"The required number of wells, spacing, and depth of wells is determined on a site-specific basis based on the aquifer thickness, groundwater flow rate and direction, and the other geologic and hydrogeologic characteristics of the site. All groundwater monitoring systems must be certified by a qualified groundwater scientist and must comply with the sampling and analytical procedures outlined in the regulations.There are three phases of groundwater monitoring requirements: Detection Monitoring - monitoring for the 62 constituents listed in Appendix I of 40 CFR Part 258 and sampling that occurs at least semiannually throughout the landfill's active life and post-closure period."
 Regulation , Groundwater monitoring ,"If any of the constituents is detected at a higher level than the established background level, state regulatory agencies must be notified and an assessment monitoring program begun. Assessment monitoring - within 90 days of detection of an increase in constituents, a MSWLF must begin an assessment monitoring program. Samples must be taken from all wells and analyzed for the presence of all 214 constituents listed in Appendix II of 40 CFR Part 258. If any of the constituents are detected, background levels for these constituents and establish a groundwater protection standard (GWPS) for each."
 Regulation , Groundwater monitoring ,"Within 90 days of establishing the background levels and GWPS, resamples for all constituents in Appendix I and Appendix II. Resampling must then be completed at least semiannually. Provided that levels remain within specified limits after two sampling events, the facility may return to the detection monitoring phase. If levels remain higher than standard, the owners/operators of the MSWLF must characterize the nature of the release, determine if contamination has migrated beyond the facility boundary, and begin assessing corrective measures."
 Regulation , Groundwater monitoring ,"Corrective measures - must be protective of human health and the environment, meet the GWPS, control the source(s) of the release to prevent further releases, and manage any solid waste generated in accordance with all applicable RCRA regulations. Remedial actions must continue until three years of consecutive compliance are met."
 Regulation , Landfill gas utilization ,"A United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report indicates that as of 2016, counts of operational municipal solid waste landfills range between 1,900 and 2,000. In a nationwide study done by the Environmental Research and Education Foundation in 2013, only 1,540 operational municipal solid waste landfills were counted throughout the United States. Decomposing waste in these landfills produces landfill gas, which is a mixture of about half methane and half carbon dioxide."
 Regulation , Landfill gas utilization ,"Landfills are the third-largest source of methane emissions in the United States, with municipal solid waste landfills representing 95 percent of this fraction.In the U.S., the number of landfill gas projects increased from 399 in 2005, to 594 in 2012 according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These projects are popular because they control energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These projects collect the methane gas and treat it, so it can be used for electricity or upgraded to pipeline-grade gas. (Methane gas has twenty-one times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide)."
 Regulation , Landfill gas utilization ,"For example, in the U.S., Waste Management uses landfill gas as an energy source at 110 landfill gas-to-energy facilities. This energy production offsets almost two million tons of coal per year, creating energy equivalent to that needed by four hundred thousand homes. These projects also reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.The EPA, which estimates that hundreds of landfills could support gas to energy projects, has also established the Landfill Methane Outreach Program. This program was developed to reduce methane emissions from landfills in a cost-effective manner by encouraging the development of environmentally and economically beneficial landfill gas-to-energy projects."
 Regulation , Post-closure and reclamation ,"In the U.S., the regulatory structure for landfills specifies a 30-year post-closure monitoring period. It is presumed that at the end of the 30-year period, the landfill will be stable and will no longer require intensive monitoring."
 Regulation , Post-closure and reclamation ,"Today, landfills are designed from the start to ensure protection of the environment and public health, and the safe and productive use of the site after closure.There are three categories of post-closure uses of landfill sites: Category 1 - open space, agricultural and passive recreation; Category 2 - Active recreation, parking or industrial/commercial activities; and Category 3 - Intensive uses such as residences, industry and commercial development.Category 1 post-closures are the most numerous and may be the least recognizable due to the fact they appear to be nothing more than an open field."
 Regulation , Post-closure and reclamation ,"Some examples include: Westview Sanitary Landfill in Georgia - now a cemetery and Griffith Park in California - used for hiking trails. Category 2 post-closures may have utilities, light structures or paving. Examples include Settler's Hill Landfill in Illinois - now golf courses and a minor league baseball field or the Germantown Sanitary Landfill in Wisconsin that is now a ski slope. Category 3 post-closures are usually characterized by inclusion of major structures."
 Regulation , Post-closure and reclamation ,"Some of the most well known are Mile High Stadium in Colorado which is the football stadium for the Denver Broncos; Brickyard Shopping Center in Illinois; and Columbia Point in Massachusetts, home of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, and University of Massachusetts Boston's State Archives Building. The EPA has collected and reported data on the generation and disposal of waste in the United States for more than 30 years."
 Regulation , Post-closure and reclamation ,"Recent estimates state that the amount of municipal waste disposed of in US landfills per year is about 265 million tonnes (261,000,000 long tons; 292,000,000 short tons) as of 2013.Organic materials are estimated to be the largest component of MSW. Paper and paperboard account for 29% and yard trimmings and food scraps account for another 27%; plastics 12%; metals 9%, rubber, leather and textiles 8%; wood is approximately 6.4% and glass 5%. Other miscellaneous wastes make up approximately 3.4%.In 2010, Americans recovered almost 65 million tons of MSW (excluding composting) through recycling."
 Regulation , Post-closure and reclamation ,"Between 1980 and 2013, waste disposed in landfills decreased from 89% to under 53%.In 2013, about 32.7 million tons of MSW were combusted for energy recovery.Research has shown that leachate treatment facilities at modern landfills are capable of removing 100 percent of the trace organics and over 85 percent of the heavy metals.The Puente Hills Landfill is the largest landfill in America. Over 150 m (490 ft) of garbage has risen from the ground since the area became a designated landfill site in 1957.In 1986, there were 7,683 landfills in the United States."
 Regulation , Post-closure and reclamation ,"By 2009, there were just 1,908 landfills nationwide: a 75 percent decline in disposal facilities in less than 25 years. However, this number is deceptive. Much of the decrease is due to consolidation of multiple landfills into a single, more efficient facility. Also technology has allowed for each acre of landfill to take 30% more waste. So during this time, the available landfill per person has increased by almost 30%.

 History ,,"The Lockheed Propulsion Company was founded in 1952 as the Grand Central Rocket Company by Major C. C. Moseley, co-founder of Western Airlines and Charles E. Bartley, the inventor of rubber-based solid rocket fuel propellants.The company announced on 22 December 1953, that a plant for manufacturing solid fuel rocket propellant would be built in the Redlands-Mentone area, and that negotiations with the Redlands City Council for 160 acres of city-owned land in East Lugonia were underway. The facility was expected to begin operation within 90 days."
 History ,,"At the outset, 53 highly skilled technicians would be employed.In 1954, the company began operations at a 1,100 acre (?) site in the Mentone area. By 1956, the firm had 130 employees, and was expanding, said President Charles E. Bartley.The U.S. Navy announced on 5 April 1956 that Grand Central Rocket Co. had been selected to build the solid-propellant third-stage rocket for Project Vanguard.Local residents reported explosions at the plant on occasion. One such case occurred at 6:55 p.m., according to the Redlands police, on 24 January 1957."
 History ,,"The San Bernardino Sheriff's office stated that it was just another ""prepared test explosion."" Company officials would not elaborate, saying only it was a controlled testing procedure.The Redlands plant provided the ABL X-248 Altair third stage of the Vanguard 1 satellite launch vehicle in 1958. Vanguard 1 and this upper stage remain in orbit, making them the oldest still-in-orbit artificial satellites. Grand Central signed a contract to produce the solid rocket motor for the Project Mercury escape tower."
 History ,,"This motor was ultimately produced by Lockheed when the Redlands plant was sold to Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.Grand Central was acquired by Lockheed in February 1960 to become the Lockheed Propulsion Company as a research and production facility of solid fuel rockets and solid rocket propellant.On 8 September 1964, LPC President Robert F. Hurt launched a Zero Defects Program, aiming at a goal of defect-free performance in all phases of LPC operation. Representatives of Southern California firms supplying the company met at the Redlands headquarters on 16 September and were urged to pledge their support of the program."

 History ,,"Thiokol was ultimately selected as the solid rocket booster provider on 20 November 1973. In January 1974, Lockheed protested to the General Accounting Office (GAO) NASA's selection of Thiokol as designer of the SRB. Because of the protest, NASA issued Thiokol a 90-day study contract on 13 February so the firm could continue its work while GAO studied the situation. The study contract was extended again on 20 May for 45 days."
 History ,,"In May 1975, NASA confirmed the Thiokol SRB contract.With the end of the Apollo project contracts, and no orders for the Space Shuttle program, as well as the conclusion of the AGM-69 SRAM project, Lockheed Propulsion Company was closed and sold in 1975. ""In the 1980s, trichloroethylene (TCE), a solvent, was detected in four out of twelve groundwater wells sampled in the Redlands area."
 History ,,"The Division of Drinking Water and Environmental Management (DDW) within the California Department of Health Services CDHS, directed that any drinking water wells which contained TCE at levels exceeding 5 parts per billion (ppb) or the maximum contaminant level (MCL), be taken off-line. In 1989, as a result of the TCE contamination, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB), Santa Ana Region, and the Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) provided funding for the installation of a Liquid Phase Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) groundwater treatment system to treat and clean the water from the TCE impacted wells."
 History ,,"Subsequent investigations by the CRWQCB determined that Lockheed Martin Corporation (formerly Lockheed Propulsion Company) was the source of the TCE contamination. TCE had been the primary contaminant of concern emanating from the Lockheed site, until mid-1997 when the first tests for perchlorate in drinking water were performed.""In 1997, ammonium perchlorate was discovered in a number of domestic water supply wells that serve several water purveyors throughout San Bernardino and Riverside counties. Two of the wells in the City of Loma Linda's municipal drinking water system had been impacted by the perchlorate groundwater plume, originating from the Lockheed site."
 History ,,"Perchlorate adversely affects human health by interfering with iodine uptake into the thyroid gland. In adults, the thyroid gland helps regulate the metabolism by releasing hormones, while in children, the thyroid helps in proper development.Some 800 residents in the Redlands community subsequently filed suit against Lockheed, alleging that the groundwater contamination had caused health problems. The California Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling in 2003, however, found that the citizens of Redlands, had no basis for filing a class action toxic tort lawsuit against the Lockheed Martin Corporation. The ruling in Carrillo v."
 History ,,"Lockheed Martin both clarified the terms upon which mass medical tort claims may be filed, and debunked the increasingly common notion that ""medical monitoring"" is always a reasonable response when people are exposed to hazardous chemicals.Nonetheless, the Lockheed-Martin Corporation, successor to Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, has resisted efforts to make it pay for the clean-up of the contamination. Federal policies allowed for burning toxic chemical waste in open, unlined dirt pits during the 1970s, according to a lawsuit that Lockheed Martin Corp. filed against the U.S. government."
 History ,,"Lockheed reported more than $500 million in liabilities companywide from ""environmental matters,"" which include soil and groundwater contamination in Redlands and unrelated projects, according to SEC filings. In a suit filed on 1 July 2008, the company wants the government to pay past cleanup costs and to be held liable for future expenses. A Lockheed spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court in the District of Columbia. The lawsuit doesn't say how much money the company is seeking."

 Prior to 1955 ,,"Prior to the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955, little headway was made to initiate this air pollution reform. U.S. cities Chicago and Cincinnati first established smoke ordinances in 1881. In 1904, Philadelphia passed an ordinance limiting the amount of smoke in flues, chimneys, and open spaces. The ordinance imposed a penalty if not all smoke inspections were passed. It was not until 1947 that California authorized the creation of Air Pollution Control Districts in every county of the state. There have been several amendments made to The Air Pollution Act of 1955."
 Prior to 1955 ,,"The first amendment came in 1960, which extended research funding for four years. The next amendment came in 1962 and basically enforced the principle provisions of the original act. In addition, this amendment also called for research to be done by the Surgeon General. In 1967, the Air Quality Act of 1967 was passed. In 1967, the Air Quality Act was enacted in order to expand federal government activities. In accordance with this law, enforcement proceedings were initiated in areas subject to interstate air pollution transport. This amendment allowed states to enact federal automobile emissions standards."
 Prior to 1955 ,,"Senator Edmond Muskie (D-Maine) said that this was the “first comprehensive federal air pollution control.” The National Air Pollution Control Administration then provided technical information to the states, which the states used to develop air quality standards. The NAPCA then had the power to veto any of the states' proposed emission standards. This amendment was not as effective as it was initially thought to be, with only 36 air regions designated, and as well as no states having fully developed pollution control programs. In 1969, another amendment was made to the act."
 Prior to 1955 ,,"This amendment further expanded the research on low emissions, fuels, and automobiles.The 1970 amendments, also known as the Clean Air Act, completely rewrote the 1967 act. In particular, the 1970 amendments required the newly created The United States Environmental Protection Agency to set technology-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards for major new stationary sources and state air quality management programs to protect public health and welfare."
 Prior to 1955 ,,"In addition, the 1970 amendments required various states to submit state implementation plans for attaining and maintaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and required the use of air monitoring to determine if implementation plans were successful. National technology-forcing emissions standards were also set for new automobiles. This amendment allowed citizens the ability to sue polluters or government agencies for failure to abide by the act. Finally, the amendment required that by 1975, the entire United States would attain clean air status.1990 was the most recent amendments to the act under President George H. W. Bush."
 Prior to 1955 ,,"The 1990 amendments granted significantly more authority to the federal government than any prior air quality legislation. Nine subjects were identified in this amendment, with smog, acid rain, motor vehicle emissions, and toxic air pollution among them. Five severity classifications were identified to measure smog. To better control acid rain, new regulatory programs were created. New and stricter emission standards were created for motor vehicles beginning with the 1995 model year. The National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants program was created to expand much broader industries and activities."
 Prior to 1955 ,,"The first National Air Pollution Symposium in the United States was held in 1949 and hosted by Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International). At first, smaller governments were responsible for the passage and enforcement of such legislation. The main purpose of the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 was to provide research assistance to find a way to control air pollution from its source. A total of $5 million was granted to the public health service for a five-year period to conduct this research."
 Prior to 1955 ,,"According to a private website, the amount was $3 million allotted per year for the five-year period of research. This was the first act from the government that made U.S. citizens and policy makers aware of this global problem. Unfortunately, this act did little to prevent air pollution, but it at least made government aware that this was a national problem. The act allowed Congress to reserve the right to control this growing problem. The Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 was the first federal law regarding air pollution."
 Prior to 1955 ,,"This act began to inform the public about the hazards of air pollution and detailed new emissions standards. Public opinion polls showed that the percentage of Americans who regarded air pollution as a serious problem almost doubled from 28% in 1965 to 55% in 1968 with the addition of all the amendments made to the original Air Pollution Control Act of 1955.Despite having the term ""control"" in the title of the act, this legislation had no regulation component."
 Prior to 1955 ,,"In the early 1950s Congress did not want to interfere with states' rights; as such, the early laws of the act were not strong. This act set up the role that the government would play in research on air pollution effects and control. As such, the act was the forefront of the air pollution movement that continues to this day. Amendments were added to The Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 as well as the Clear Air Act frequently by the government, as the government continued to further research on the topic and improve air quality."

 History , A city dump ,"This area in the Upper Ninth Ward of New Orleans was swampy low ground when it began to be used as a dump in 1909. The landfill became one of the area's main dumps for both residential and industrial waste. It often caught fire, with flames and smoke visible for a good distance away, and got the local nickname Dante's Inferno. The dump was first closed in 1952, but continued as a sanitary landfill site to the end of the decade. It reopened in the aftermath of Hurricane Betsy, and much debris from that storm was deposited on site."
 History , A city dump ,"It was officially reclosed in 1966, although reports indicate that dumping continued for another year. The landfill site was then covered with ash from city incinerators and compacted by bulldozers."
 History , Redevelopment ,"Starting in 1978, the old dump site was covered with sand and soil then redeveloped as a residential neighborhood, with 67 single-family homes, 225 townhouses (majority public housing), a 128-unit apartment complex, Moton Elementary School, and a small shopping plaza. Three residential developments - Press Park (the townhouses), Gordon Plaza (the single-family homes), and Liberty Terrace (the apartment building) - were built over the old landfill area. The redevelopment project was championed by then mayor Dutch Morial as an opportunity for low-income African-Americans to qualify for home ownership."
 History , Redevelopment ,"Along with the City of New Orleans led by Morial, additional sponsors of the redevelopment project included former U.S. Representative William J. Jefferson, New Orleans City Councilman Johnny Jackson, the Housing Authority of New Orleans, the New Orleans school board, and HUD."
 History , Problems ,"Complaints of trash working its way up to the surface and health problems by area residents first prompted Environmental Protection Agency investigations in 1986. The area was initially judged not worthy of federal remedy and no further remedial action was planned by the EPA. In 1991, the US Centers for Disease Control revised the national levels for lead in blood from 25 ugm/DL to 10 ugm/DL, prompting new concern for environmental lead exposure."
 History , Problems ,"Residents continued finding old trash just below the surface when trying to plant gardens or erect fences, and anecdotal evidence of health problems including abnormally high rates of cancer became common (though the ATSDR found, in September 1997, that statistically higher breast cancer rates in the area were not related to the site). People in the area petitioned for retesting in 1993, and the site was placed on the National Priorities List as a cleanup site the following year. Investigations showed that the actual amount of soil placed over the landfill before redevelopment was much thinner than had been claimed."
 History , Remedial work ,"EPA supervised cleanup included closing Moton Elementary, and on residential land removing two feet of soil, putting down a geotextile barrier, then topping it with two feet of new clean soil. In April 2001 it was announced to be 99% complete. Many area homeowners and residents have petitioned for being moved elsewhere, with the backing of Congressman Bill Jefferson, but they have not succeeded in getting funds provided."
 History , After Hurricane Katrina ,"Flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina disrupted this area (see: Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans), with storm surge funneled by the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal flooding into this neighborhood in 2005. There are concerns that the flooding has released additional toxins in the area. ""Press Park"", a 56 townhouse housing complex in the area, has been found contaminated with benzopyrene at levels some 50 times EPA health screening level, and remains fenced off as of April 2010."
 History , After Hurricane Katrina ,"In March 2018, the Orleans Parish School Board was ordered by civil district judge Tiffany Chase to pay a $12 million dollar judgment to 1,433 former students of Moton Elementary School. This was the equivalent of $1,000 per year each student spent at the school, plus interest.

 Overview ,,"Water pollution was identified as a growing problem in the US by scientists, government officials and the public in the 19th century. Many cities and towns piped their untreated domestic sewage into nearby waterways. Wastewater discharged by factories, mines and other businesses increased as the economy expanded. Large cities, and later smaller communities, began to install drinking water treatment systems in the early 20th century, but sewage treatment plants were limited at that time and not very effective. Effective control of sewage and industrial pollution was not comprehensively addressed until later in the century."
 Overview ,,"Agricultural pollution emerged as a growing problem in the 20th century with the increased mechanization of agriculture and increasing use of chemicals.Following the passage of the 1972 Clean Water Act (CWA), the levels of water pollution in US waterways generally have experienced a dramatic decrease with respect to sewage outflow and many types of industrial wastewater. The 1972 law did not address surface runoff from farms or urban runoff pollution. Municipal stormwater runoff became subject to regulation in 1987, although implementation of the requirements by cities and towns has been a slow and difficult process. About half of U.S."
 Overview ,,"stream and river miles continue to violate federal water quality standards in the 21st century. Surveys of lakes, ponds and reservoirs indicated that about 70 percent were impaired (measured on a surface area basis), and a little more than 70 percent of the nation’s coastlines, and 90 percent of the surveyed ocean and near coastal areas were also impaired. A related 2017 report on the nation's water quality prepared by the U.S."
 Overview ,,"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stated that 46% of river and stream miles, 21% of the nation’s lakes, 18% of coastal and Great Lakes waters, and 32% of the nation's wetland areas are in ""poor biological condition."" Agriculture, industry, urban runoff, and other sources continue to discharge waste into surface waters nationwide. This poses huge environmental and health risks given that these water sources are used as drinking water and for agricultural use. While the CWA has made positive contributions to the state of surface water in the United States, the law does not fully address all aspects of pollution."
 Overview ,,"Many think that Congress should revise or expand the law to address these problems and gaps in regulation. Although the CWA has been effective in controlling point source pollution (where the discharge is typically via a pipe or ditch and assigning responsibility for mitigation is straightforward), it has not been as effective with nonpoint sources (where discharges are diffuse, and treatment or prevention may be technically difficult or very expensive).Despite the negative health and ecosystem impacts of water pollution, solutions exist that are able to treat and decrease pollution levels in water bodies."
 Types , Surface water pollution ,"Surface water consists of all forms of visible water sources, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers. Currently, a significant percentage of surface freshwater sources are polluted in the United States. This poses a huge threat to American water sources because over 60% of water used in the United States is from these freshwater sources. A majority of freshwater contamination cases are a result of nutrient pollution, which is the result of farm waste and fertilizer entering water bodies, creating zones with depleted oxygen levels."
 Types , Groundwater pollution ,"Groundwater is rainfall that collects in porous spaces deep underground, which are called aquifers. Humans can access the water that collects in an aquifer by building wells to pump the water to the surface for use. About 40% of drinking water in America comes from groundwater sources. When contaminants enter aquifers, the pollution spreads, eliminating the potential to use the aquifer for drinking water. Groundwater contamination is often the result of chemicals that seep through the soil and into the water supply, such as pesticides and fertilizers."
 Types , Groundwater pollution ,"Other causes of contamination in groundwater includes gasoline, oil, road salts, septic tank waste, or leakage from landfills."
 Categories of pollution sources , Point source ,"Point source pollution occurs when water pollution contamination comes from a single source. Point sources could include leaking septic tanks, oil spills, dumping of waste, or wastewater treatment facilities. In order to prevent point source pollution from occurring, the Clean Water Act regulates what can be discharged into a water body by requiring each facility to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit."
 Categories of pollution sources , Nonpoint source ,"Nonpoint source pollution occurs when the contamination derives from multiple different sources. This type of pollution is very challenging to manage given that the original source(s) may be difficult to identify. Nonpoint source pollution is the most common type of pollution because as rainfall runs off of land on its path to different water sources, it becomes contaminated by pollutants from the surrounding area. These sources include agriculture related pollutants, urban runoff, or drainage. The CWA does not authorize the issuance of NPDES permits for nonpoint sources,"
 Categories of pollution sources , Trans-boundary sources ,Trans-boundary water pollution occurs when pollution in one country’s waters spreads and damages another country’s environment or water supply. Trans-boundary pollution can travel through rivers or ocean currents.
 Causes of pollution , Municipal sewage ,"Historically, municipal sewage was a major contributor of water pollution across the United States. The lack of proper treatment of sewage resulted in many contaminated water bodies across the county. Domestic sewage became a widespread problem with the onset of the industrial revolution in the 19th century, population growth and increasing urbanization. Through the early 20th century, most communities had no sewage treatment plants or waste disposal sites."
 Causes of pollution , Municipal sewage ,"Some cities built sewer pipes which carried their sewage to a nearby river or coastal area, but lacked any treatment of the wastes, instead depositing the sewage directly into the water.: 48–50 The first wastewater treatment plants were built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States and typically did not fully treat the wastes.The extensive construction of new and upgraded sewage treatment systems following the passage of the 1972 Clean Water Act has greatly reduced municipal discharges. Since the 1980s secondary treatment has been the national standard for municipalities."
 Causes of pollution , Municipal sewage ,"Some individual systems continue to cause localized water quality problems due to outdated or leaking piping and collection systems, leading to combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows.: 56–57 Poor upkeep of sewer infrastructure results in contamination from leaks, and contributed to a rating from the American Society of Civil Engineers of a ""D"" grade for America's wastewater infrastructure. While all domestic wastewater is now treated nationwide, leaks and spills of municipal sewage pose a significant problem because wastewater carries diseases like salmonella, hepatitis, and many other infectious diseases that roughly sickens about 3.5 million Americans every year."
 Causes of pollution , Urban runoff ,"Water research during the late 1970s and 1980s indicated that stormwater runoff was a significant cause of water quality impairment in many parts of the US. Increased land development throughout the country—in both cities and suburbs—has led to an increase in impervious surfaces (parking lots, roads, buildings, compacted soil), which generates increased surface runoff during wet weather. The development of new roads and smooth surfaces have contributed to polluted waters easily flowing into nearby rivers, lakes, and the oceans across the USA."
 Causes of pollution , Urban runoff ,"These paved surfaces and roads restrict water from soaking into the ground, and instead allows water to freely flow across pavements while picking up chemicals, fertilizers, pesticides, and many other pollutants that causes water pollution in the bodies of water in the USA."
 Causes of pollution , Industrial pollution ,"Early indications of pollution from industrial waste in the United States existed since the 1870s, increasing as the industrial revolution expanded throughout the United States and its environmental impacts were observed more frequently. Industrial wastes contribute toxic pollutants and chemicals and can have detrimental ecosystem and public health impacts if discharged directly into surface water."
 Causes of pollution , Growth of industrialization and industrial waste ,"Historical accounts of early industrial activity in the US provide a general description of the kinds of waste generated. Mining operations (coal, metals, minerals), iron forges and blast furnaces were some of the early industries in the U.S. that generated waste. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, wastes from mining operations entered rivers and streams, and iron bloomeries and furnaces used water for cooling.: 27, 32–33, 53 These industries were relatively small businesses generating small amounts of product, and the wastes they discharged to rivers and streams were proportionately dilute."
 Causes of pollution , Growth of industrialization and industrial waste ,"However as factories grew in the 19th century, so did the quantity of pollution produced. In the early 19th century, the introduction of steam engines in both the mining and manufacturing sectors (such as textiles) greatly expanded productivity, and increased use of the engines generated larger volumes of heated water (thermal pollution).: 52–53 The productivity gains, along with the introduction of railroads in the 1830s and 1840s—which increased the overall demand for coal and minerals—led to additional generation of wastes.: 68–69 The volumes and concentrations of industrial wastes increased significantly in the mid-19th century in multiple business sectors, including mining."
 Causes of pollution , Growth of industrialization and industrial waste ,"Mining wastes were increasing, not only from coal and mineral mines in the east and south, but from mining of gold, silver and other metals in the newly-developing west.: 92–95 The onset of the second industrial revolution in the mid-to-late 19th century introduced new heavy industries in the US, generating larger volumes and new kinds of wastes."
 Causes of pollution , Growth of industrialization and industrial waste ,"These industries included: oil and gas extraction petroleum refineries iron and steel, with new manufacturing processes developed in the 1850s-1860s that generated new kinds of toxic chemical wastes: 75–76 manufacturing (smelting) of non-ferrous metals such as copper, zinc, lead and aluminum rubber manufacturing fertilizers and chemicals (late 19th century).Industrial expansion continued into the 20th century, including large-scale expansion of paper products manufacturing, which produced additional types and quantities of wastes."
 Causes of pollution , Modern day industrial waste ,"Today, industrial pollution is caused by discharges and emissions from manufacturing plants in certain industries, which continues to pollute surface waters nationwide. Many manufacturing processes generate wastewater, contributing to the water pollution found in rivers, lakes, and oceans. In 2015 the EPA found that fossil-fuel power stations, particularly coal-fired plants were the largest contributors of industrial water pollution. EPA found instances where power plants discharged toxic pollutants, such as mercury, arsenic, and lead into surface waters."
 Causes of pollution , Modern day industrial waste ,"Although many industrial facilities have added or expanded their wastewater treatment systems to comply with the CWA, certain industrial sectors and facilities have not addressed all components in their discharges and continue to contribute significant quantities of pollutants to surface waters in the US.Based on a report of 21,393 industrial and commercial facilities subject to the EPA Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) system, discharges of toxic pollutants in 2019 totaled about 200 million pounds (91 kt), a decrease of 38 million pounds (17 kt) (16% reduction) from 2007, mostly due to reduced nitrate discharges."
 Causes of pollution , Modern day industrial waste ,(TRI reports do not cover all industries or all pollutants discharged.)
 Causes of pollution , Agricultural pollution ,"Discharges and chemicals from agriculture greatly contributes to water pollution in the US, as rainwater flows through fields and into bodies of water. The application of chemical fertilizers, collection of animal manure, and use of chemicals used by farmers often results in surface runoff of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus). When washed away from farm fields, nutrient pollution can cause eutrophication of water bodies. Eutrophication results in algal blooms which deplete oxygen in bodies of water, resulting in dead zones where life can no longer be sustained."
 Causes of pollution , Agricultural pollution ,"Excessive use or improper use of fertilizers, pesticides, and various types of chemicals during farming contribute to water pollution, and are currently the third largest source for water pollution in lakes, second largest source of water pollution in wetlands, and a major contributor to pollution in estuaries and ground water.There are approximately 45,000 animal feeding operation facilities, also known as factory farms, in the US. These facilities keep and feed millions of animals and produce billions of gallons of animal waste per year. In 2012 the factory farms produced 369 million tons of animal waste, typically stored in lagoons or tanks."
 Causes of pollution , Agricultural pollution ,"Depending on the type of container used, the storage systems may leak and discharge bacteria, ammonia and nutrients to nearby streams. Storage lagoons may also leak into groundwater."
 Causes of pollution , Air deposition ,"Air pollution is also a major contributor to surface water pollution. The type of pollutants in the air emitted by industrial facilities, motor vehicles, and agricultural bio-waste released to the atmosphere affect the quality of marine and fresh water bodies, thus affecting marine life, plants, animals, and ultimately human survival. Air deposition is a process whereby air pollutants emitted from sources, either industrial or natural, settle into water bodies. The deposition may lead to polluted water near the source, or at distances up to a few thousand miles away."
 Causes of pollution , Air deposition ,"The most frequently observed water pollutants resulting from industrial air deposition are sulfur compounds, nitrogen compounds, mercury compounds, other heavy metals, and some pesticides and industrial by-products. Natural sources of air deposition include forest fires and microbial activity.Acid rain is a form of air deposition, in which industrial facilities and motor vehicles emit gases such as nitrogen oxide, which interact with water vapor and then fall into water bodies, as well as on land."
 Causes of pollution , Air deposition ,"The acid rain drains all the important nutrients, such as oxygen from the water and soil causing harm to marine life, detrimental to animals and humans and it reduces the ability of plants to reproduce. On September 21, 2021 the California Air Resources Board proposed a plan to upgrade all engines in cars, trucks, and boats to EPA ""Tier 3"" levels by the end of 2024, and the ""Tier 4"" level, which is more restrictive, by 2035. Tier 4 engine technology does not yet exist."
 Causes of pollution , Air deposition ,"The Sportfishing Association of California and Golden Gate Fishermen’s Association argued against this proposal on the basis on the upgrades to their boats would be economically disastrous and would lead to charging their customers higher ticket cost, and affect their ability to stay in business. The two sides reached a compromise to upgrade to Tier 3 and delay the Tier 4 update for when the technology is available and cost effective."
 Causes of pollution , Other causes ,"Other activities that contribute to water pollution include: Accidental leaks and spills from chemical handling, such as petroleum Household disposal of products and chemicals that enter nearby water bodies Spills of oil used for transportation."
 Solutions , Municipal wastewater treatment ,"Municipal wastewater (sewage) is composed of human waste and other residential waste streams. In the United States, approximately 34 billion gallons of wastewater are collected every day and sent to sewage treatment plants. Wastewater is collected through combined sewers, which are used for sanitary waste and stormwater runoff, or in separate sanitary sewers. Sewage treatment plants include physical removal processes, such as screens and settling tanks, and biological processes to remove organic matter and pathogens from water. Treatment plants have strict permit requirements to ensure that their discharges will not cause harm to the environment or public health."
 Solutions , Municipal wastewater treatment ,Some plants have enhanced treatment processes to control nutrient pollution before discharge.
 Solutions , Agricultural wastewater treatment ,"Agricultural run-off is one of the leading causes of water pollution in the United States. Funding from Clean Water Grants are available to farmers to install projects to help control agricultural pollution before it enters water sources. Methods to minimize and contain water pollution from agriculture in the United States include watershed efforts, nutrient management, cover crops, buffers, management of livestock waste, and drainage management. Buffers are small strips of land covered in plants that are able to remove pollutants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment prior to discharge in a water body."
 Solutions , Agricultural wastewater treatment ,Both buffers and crop covers are used to remove these pollutants from agricultural runoff.
 Solutions , Industrial wastewater treatment ,"Industrial facilities may generate the following industrial wastewater flows: Manufacturing process wastestreams, which can include conventional pollutants (i.e. controllable with secondary treatment systems), toxic pollutants (e.g."
 Solutions , Industrial wastewater treatment ,"solvents, heavy metals), and other harmful compounds such as nutrients Non-process wastestreams: boiler blowdown and cooling water, which produce thermal pollution and other pollutants Industrial site drainage, generated both by manufacturing facilities, service industries and energy and mining sites Wastestreams from the energy and mining sectors: acid mine drainage, produced water from oil and gas extraction, radionuclides Wastestreams that are by-products of treatment or cooling processes: backwashing (water treatment), brine.Some facilities generate wastewater that can be treated in municipal sewage treatment plants."
 Solutions , Industrial wastewater treatment ,"Most industrial processes, such as petroleum refineries, chemical and petrochemical plants have their own specialized facilities to treat their wastewater.: 1412 Such specialized systems are designed to treat high concentrations of organic matter (e.g. oil and grease), toxic pollutants (e.g. heavy metals, volatile organic compounds) or nutrients such as ammonia.: 180 Some industries install a pre-treatment system to remove some pollutants (e.g., toxic compounds), and then discharge the partially treated wastewater to the municipal sewer system.: 59–61"
 Solutions , Erosion and sediment control ,"Erosion and sediment controls are techniques used to mitigate sediment pollution in waterways. The most common and efficient control method on agricultural land is crop management, which increases soil cover and stabilizes slopes. Without proper soil stabilization techniques, rainfall can cause large quantities of sediment to be washed away into waterways, creating issues with sunlight penetration and visibility. Typical preventive measures for construction sites include erosion control matting and mulching, and installation of silt fences to trap sediment not captured by the erosion controls."
 Solutions , Control of urban run-off ,"Urban areas affect water quality by increasing the volume of run-off and pollutant loads. One solution to decrease run-off is constructing new surfaces with pervious pavers, that allow rainwater to pass through the surface to groundwater aquifers and decrease the quantity of urban run-off. Additionally, proper use and storage of household chemicals are critical to decrease incidences of spills that pollute local waterways."
 Recent large-scale pollution incidents , Deepwater Horizon oil spill ,"The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is considered to be the largest marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry. The incident began on April 20, 2010 when a semi-submersible BP oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico about 41 miles off of the coast of Louisiana. The explosion led to discharges between 1,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil per day. It took responders 87 days to stop the spill, at which point the rig had leaked an estimated 3.19 million barrels of oil into the Gulf."
 Recent large-scale pollution incidents , Deepwater Horizon oil spill ,"Over 1,000 miles of shoreline on the Gulf of Mexico, from Texas to Florida, were impacted by the Deepwater Horizon spill."
 Recent large-scale pollution incidents , Human health impacts ,"Of the crew members present during the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, 11 died and 17 were seriously injured. In addition, the frequency of hurricanes in the Gulf makes the effects of long-term exposure on humans more applicable, as these storms are capable of carrying crude oil over miles of ocean towards the shore."
 Recent large-scale pollution incidents , Human health impacts ,"According to a research article from LSU, “damages to those living in the presence of crude oil the past 10 years are likely permanent, as chronic exposure leads to increased cancer risks, cardiovascular issues, and respiratory problems.” Oil exposure and its respiratory effects were also analyzed in a study on the Coast Guard personnel deployed to help clean up the spill. The article has 54.6% of responders stating they were exposed to crude oil, and 22.0% stating they were exposed to oil dispersants."
 Recent large-scale pollution incidents , Human health impacts ,"Of the nearly 5,000 personnel who completed the survey, 19.4% experienced coughing, 5.5% experienced shortness of breath, and 3.6% experienced wheezing. The study also found that exposure to both oil and oil dispersants presented associations that were much stronger than oil alone for the different respiratory symptoms."
 Recent large-scale pollution incidents , Environmental impacts ,"The northeast Gulf of Mexico shoreline contains about 60 percent of the coastal and freshwater marshes in the United States. A marsh environment tends to have standing water, making it among the most sensitive habitats to oil spills. Without the natural cleaning mechanism that flowing water provides, oil is able to coat marsh vegetation for longer periods of time, ruining nurseries that then impact a host of interconnected species. The Gulf of Mexico is also home to 22 species of marine mammals."
 Recent large-scale pollution incidents , Environmental impacts ,"Of these, up to 20 percent of all Kemp’s Ridley sea turtles present during the spill ended up dying, and the Louisiana Bottlenose dolphin ended up facing a 50 percent decline in population. However, because the BP oil spill occurred miles from any land, it wasn’t as damaging to ecosystems along the shore as other oil spills. However, habitats along the shore were still exposed through balls of tar that would clump together and wash up on beaches, impacting local wildlife. Also, the consequences that drifting plumes of oil had on the deep-sea ecosystem is relatively unknown."
 Recent large-scale pollution incidents , Economic impacts ,"In December 2010, the U.S. filed a complaint in District Court against BP and several other defendants associated with the spill. The complaint resulted in a record-setting settlement, enforcing a $5.5 billion Clean Water Act penalty on BP Exploration & Production and up to $8.8 billion in natural resource damages. However, by 2015, BP had successfully recuperated most of the $40 billion lost in market value after the spill. This recovery was attributed to the company’s inclination to continue exploring new oil resources despite the accident."
 Recent large-scale pollution incidents , Economic impacts ,"Between 2011 and 2013, BP’s Gulf of Mexico oil rigs doubled, and they began investing $1 billion towards opportunities in Alaska in 2015. On the other hand, a 2015 article from NPR exhibited how fishing cities along the Gulf Coast are still feeling harmful effects of the oil spill. In an interview with an oysterman from Alabama, he states, “business is still struggling...because of the lack of oyster production...I place the blame for that on the oil spill.” The fisherman goes on to describe how the oyster reefs off of Louisiana have not been producing like they should since the spill."
 Recent large-scale pollution incidents ," Woburn, Massachusetts source water pollution ","Water pollution in the city of Woburn, Massachusetts gained public recognition in the 1984 lawsuit filed by the families of children in Woburn who had died from leukemia in unusually high numbers. The families attributed the leukemia to the town’s polluted drinking water which had been contaminated over 150 years of industry, most notably the toxic compounds used by leather factories in the area."
 Recent large-scale pollution incidents , Martin County coal slurry spill ,"The Martin County coal slurry spill occurred on October 11, 2000, when a coal slurry broke into an abandoned mine and sent an estimated 306 million gallons of slurry into the Tug Fork River. The spill polluted 200–300 miles of the Big Sandy River and a water supply for over 27,000 residents."
 Recent large-scale pollution incidents , Kingston Fossil Plant coal ash spill ,"On December 22, 2008, a dike ruptured on the Kingston Fossil Plant in Roane County, Tennessee and released 1.1 billion gallons of coal fly ash slurry into the Emory River. It was the largest fly ash release and worst coal ash-related disaster in U.S. history."
 Recent large-scale pollution incidents , 2015 Gold King Mine spill ,"On August 5, 2015 workers on the Gold King Mine in Silverton, Colorado released 3 million gallons of toxic wastewater when attempting to add a tap to the tailing pond for the mine. The wastewater carried unsafe levels of heavy metals, with some parts of the river testing for hundreds of times over their limits."
 Regulations , Historical ,"During the late 19th century, there was little federal government attention paid to what were considered to be local environmental and health problems. A few states, including Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut and Rhode Island, investigated industrial pollution problems on certain rivers within their respective boundaries but did not issue orders or regulations for the identified industries.: 1059 The only federal legislation to address water pollution during this era was the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. In the 1899 law, Congress prohibited the dumping of ""refuse""—debris that interfered with navigation—but other forms of pollution (e.g."
 Regulations , Historical ,"sewage, food waste, chemical waste, oil spills) were not addressed. In 1924, to address oil spills in harbors, Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act. The law provided for penalties in the event of oil spills, but they were applicable only to vessels in coastal waters.In the early 20th century the United States Public Health Service (PHS) began to investigate incidents of waterborne disease and drinking water contamination. In 1914 the agency published a set of drinking water standards that were applicable only to interstate common carriers such as railroads."
 Regulations , Historical ,"PHS did not have the authority to issue broad pollution control regulations, but it published recommended standards for municipal water systems (which later influenced the adoption and implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act in the 1970s). In 1922 the American Water Works Association issued a report identifying a range of industries that were pollution sources, including mining, food processing, chemical and dye works, oil wells and refineries, metal working, textiles, leather tanning, and pulp and paper mills."
 Regulations , Historical ,"However these industrial sources were not extensively studied at that time, and the principal focus of most public health professionals was on biological contamination of water from untreated sewage.: 1062 In the 1920s there was agreement among water scientists that pollution from acid mine drainage and coke manufacturing (which generates phenols) was the major industrial waste problem. In 1924 a voluntary agreement was formulated between the US Surgeon General, several state agencies and manufacturers in the Ohio River valley to control phenol discharges from coke facilities."
 Regulations , Historical ,"Regarding acid mine drainage, however, a PHS report stated that acid from mining had a positive germicidal effect and did not recommend pollution controls. PHS also conducted studies and described pollution problems in several major river systems and the Great Lakes. The PHS studies supported the development of the Streeter–Phelps equation, a water quality modelling tool that is used to predict dissolved oxygen levels in water bodies in response to pollutant loads.: 1063–5 Beginning in 1917, some states established water commissions or boards to monitor some aspects of water quality and coordinate their findings with existing state health agencies."
 Regulations , Historical ,"These commissions conducted various pollution studies but did not issue regulations, instead relying on voluntary cooperation with industry.: 1060–2 In 1948 Congress passed the Federal Water Pollution Control Act which created a comprehensive set of water quality programs that also provided some financing for state and local governments. Enforcement was limited to interstate waters. PHS provided financial and technical assistance."
 Regulations , Current regulations ,"The Clean Water Act is the primary federal law in the United States governing water pollution in surface waters. The 1972 CWA amendments established a broad regulatory framework for improving water quality. The law defines procedures for pollution control and developing criteria and standards for pollutants in surface water. The law authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate surface water pollution in the United States, in partnership with state agencies. Prior to 1972 it was legal to discharge wastewater to surface waters without testing for or removing water pollutants."
 Regulations , Current regulations ,"The CWA was amended in 1981 and 1987 to adjust the federal proportion of construction grant funding for local governments, regulate municipal storm sewer discharges and to later establish the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. The fund provides low-interest loans to improve municipal sewage treatment systems and finance other water quality improvements.Under the CWA, the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulates permits for discharges into water bodies. The EPA regulations require each facility to apply for a specific permit for its wastewater discharges, and consequently require that each facility treat its wastewater."
 Regulations , Current regulations ,"In addition to effluent limitations, the permits include monitoring and reporting requirements, which are used by EPA and states to enforce the limitations. However, over fifty percent of the rivers in the United States still violate pollution standards published by the states. Additional regulation exists on a state-by-state basis, allowing for more stringent regulation for protected bodies of water. Additional regulation may be enacted to limit pollution that comes from nonpoint sources, such as agriculture. In many watersheds, nonpoint sources are the principal cause of noncompliance with water quality standards."
 Regulations , Current regulations ,"EPA and states may employ a CWA regulatory mechanism called total maximum daily load (TMDL) to establish stringent pollution controls and may apply the requirements to both point sources and nonpoint sources. In 2010 EPA and several states developed extensive watershed-scale requirements in a large TMDL document for the Chesapeake Bay.Some economists questioned whether the 1972 law was delivering the promised results of cleaner rivers and lakes, and whether benefits exceeded the costs to society. The United States government has spent over one trillion dollars trying to combat water pollution."
 Regulations , Current regulations ,"In the CWA Congress had declared that the nation's waters were to be free of pollutants by 1983, only eleven years after enactment. In general, water quality has improved nationwide since 1972, but not all pollution has been eliminated. Between 1972 and 2001 there was a 12 percent increase in the number of waterways that are safe for fishing. Data supporting this finding is limited; only 19 percent of the United States’ waterways had been tested for contamination.Groundwater protection provisions are included in the Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Superfund act."

 Background ,,"Gold mining in the hills around Gold King was the primary income and economy for the region until 1991, when the last mine closed near Silverton. The Gold King Mine was abandoned in 1923. Prior to the spill, the Upper Animas water basin had already become devoid of fish, because of the adverse environmental impacts of regional mines such as Gold King, when contaminants entered the water system. Other plant and animal species were also adversely affected in the watershed before the Gold King Mine breach. Many abandoned mines throughout Colorado are known to have problems with acid mine drainage."
 Background ,,"The chemical processes involved in acid mine drainage are common around the world: where subsurface mining exposes metal sulfide minerals such as pyrite to water and air, this water must be carefully managed to prevent harm to riparian ecology. At the time of the accident, the EPA was working at the Gold King Mine to stem the leaking mine water going into Cement Creek. Water was accumulating behind a plug at the mine's entrance. They planned to add pipes that would allow the slow release and treatment of that water before it backed up enough to blow out."
 Background ,,"Unknown to the crew, the mine tunnel behind the plug was already full of pressurized water. It burst through the plug soon after excavation began. In the 1990s, sections of the Animas had been nominated by the EPA as a Superfund site for clean-up of pollutants from the Gold King Mine and other mining operations along the river. Lack of community support prevented its listing. Under the law, the EPA had authority to do only minor work to abate environmental impacts of the mine."
 Background ,,"Locals had feared that classifying this as a Superfund site would reduce tourism in the area, which was the largest remaining source of income for the region since the closure of the metal mines."
 Background , Mine ownership ,Gold King Mine was originally discovered and owned by Olaf Nelson the “Mighty Swede” in 1887. Nelson died before he could develop the mine leaving his widow to sell the mine in 1894.
 Background , Prior reclamation ,"The Gold King Mine's adits were dry for most of the mine's recent history, as the area was being drained from below by the Sunnyside Mine's American Tunnel. Sunnyside Mine closed in 1991. As part of a reclamation plan, the American Tunnel was sealed up in 1996. In the absence of drainage, by 2002 a new discharge of particularly contaminated water had begun to flow from the Gold King Level 7 adit. Flow there increased again after the nearby Mogul Mine was sealed by its owners in 2003."
 Background , Prior reclamation ,"In 2006, a spot measurement of flow from this adit showed a peak of 314 US gal/min (1,190 L/min). The significance of this figure is unclear since flow was not being logged continuously.: 17–22 By this time, the Gold King was considered one of the worst acid mine drainage sites in Colorado. In 2009, the Colorado Department of Natural Resources Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety (DRMS) plugged all four Gold King Mine portals by stuffing them with old mine backfill; drainage pipes were installed to prevent water from ponding behind the entrance."
 Background , Prior reclamation ,"This work was complicated by partial collapse of the mine tunnel near the entrance. It was noted that the drainage system might not be sufficient to prevent a future blowout.: 35 In 2014, Colorado DRMS asked the EPA to reopen and stabilize the Gold King 7 adit.: 35 Reportedly no maintenance on the existing drainage system had been performed since it was installed in 2009. It was noted that flow from the drains had decreased from 112 to 12.6 US gal/min (424–48 L/min) between August 25, 2014, and September 11, 2014."
 Background , Prior reclamation ,"The cause of this decrease was unknown but attributed to seasonal variation.: 35 While excavating the opening, workers saw seepage at six feet (1.8 m) above the bottom of the tunnel; they believed that meant that there was six feet (1.8 m) of water backed up in the tunnel. Excavation at the entrance was postponed until 2015, so that a pond large enough to treat that volume of water could be constructed.: 36"
 Background , Blowout ,The EPA team returned in July 2015 to continue the work.
 Background , Blowout ,"They found that a landslide had covered the drainage pipes.: 42 When the slide was cleared, seepage was again observed at a level about six feet (1.8 m) above the bottom of the mine entrance, which they thought was the level of pooled water behind the plug.: 46 They planned to excavate the entrance beginning from the level of the top of the mine tunnel down to what they took to be the top of the water, insert a pipe through that clearance, and drain the pooled water.: 47–52 DRMS and the EPA discussed the plan and came to an agreement."
 Background , Blowout ,"However, they had misjudged the level of the water in the tunnel. At around 10:51 AM on August 5, the backhoe operator saw a spurt of clear water spray about two feet (61 cm) out of a fracture in the wall of the plug, indicating that the mine tunnel was full of pressurized water."
 Background , Blowout ,"Failure of the plug produced uncontrolled release within minutes.: 52–59 Rushing to Cement Creek, the torrent of water washed out the access road to the site.: 60 The EPA had considered drilling into the mine from above in order to measure the water level directly before beginning excavation at the entrance, as was done at nearby mines in 2011."
 Background , Blowout ,"Had they done so, they would have discovered the true water level, and changed their plan; the disaster would not have occurred.: 2 Operating mines have been required to perform such measurement of water level since a fatal mine flood in 1895.: A-4 The impact on the Animas River was quickly visible; one Durango-based journalist described the water color after the accident as ""Tang that has been maybe mixed too thickly."" The river was closed to recreation until August 14. During the closure, county officials warned river visitors to stay out of the water."
 Background , Blowout ,"Residents with wells in floodplains were told to have their water tested before drinking it or bathing in it. People were told to avoid contact with the river, including contact by their pets, and to prevent farmed animals from drinking the water. They were advised not to catch fish in the river. The Navajo Nation Commission on Emergency Management issued a state of emergency declaration in response to the spill; it has suffered devastating effects.People living along the Animas and San Juan rivers were advised to have their water tested before using it for cooking, drinking, or bathing."
 Background , Blowout ,"The spill was expected to cause major problems for farmers and ranchers who rely on the rivers for their livelihoods.The long-term impacts of the spill are unknown, as sedimentation is expected to dilute the pollutants as the spill cloud moves downstream. The acid mine drainage temporarily changed the color of the river to orange.By August 7, the waste reached Aztec, New Mexico; the next day, it reached the city of Farmington, the largest municipality affected by the disaster."
 Background , Blowout ,"By August 10, the waste had reached the San Juan River in New Mexico and Shiprock (part of the Navajo Nation), with no evidence to that date of human injury or wildlife die-off. The heavy metals appeared to be settling to the bottom of the river. They are largely insoluble unless the entire river becomes very acidic. The waste was initially expected to reach Lake Powell by August 12; arriving on August 14, it was expected to pass through the lake within two weeks."
 Background , Blowout ,"The Utah Division of Water Quality said the remaining contaminants will be diluted to a point where there will be no danger to users beyond that point. By August 11, pollutant levels at Durango returned to pre-incident levels. On August 12, the leading edge of the plume was no longer visible due to dilution and sediment levels in the river. The discharge rate of waste water at Gold King Mine was 610 US gal/min (2,300 L/min) as of August 12."
 Environmental impact , Heavy metals ,"On August 10, 2015, the EPA reported that levels of six metals were above limits allowed for domestic water by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. The department requires municipalities to cease to use water when the levels in it exceed the limits. Some metals were found at hundreds of times their limits, e.g. lead 100 times the limit, iron 326 times the limit. Arsenic and cadmium were also above the limits. The measurement was made 15 miles (24 km) upstream from Durango."
 Environmental impact , Heavy metals ,"In January 2018, global science and engineering consultants Knight Piésold reported, while the spill had ""further limited aquatic life,"" its ""resulting impacts on aquatic life, including the trout fishery downstream of Silverton, would undoubtedly be more adverse"" were it not for actions taken by SGC, and that ""Before the first miner arrived, there was massive natural metals loading in the Animas River, which limited aquatic life, including trout populations downstream from Silverton."" Through a FOIA request, Associated Press obtained EPA files indicating that U.S."
 Environmental impact , Heavy metals ,"government officials ""knew of ‘blowout’ risk for tainted water at mine,"" which could result from the EPA's intervention. EPA authorities had learned of this risk through a June 2014 work order that read ""Conditions may exist that could result in a blowout of the blockages and cause a release of large volumes of contaminated mine waters and sediment from inside the mine, which contain concentrated heavy metals."" In addition, a May 2015 action plan for the mine ""also noted the potential for a blowout."" An EPA spokeswoman was not able to state what precautions the EPA took."
 Government action , Immediate response ,On
 Government action , Immediate response ,"February 11, 2016, the Denver Post reported that Hays Griswold, the EPA employee in charge of the Gold King mine, wrote in an e-mail to other EPA officials ""that he personally knew the blockage 'could be holding back a lot of water and I believe the others in the group knew as well.'"" The Post added: ""Griswold's e-mail appears directly to contradict those findings and statements he made to The Denver Post in the days after the disaster, when he claimed 'nobody expected (the acid water backed up in the mine) to be that high.'""The EPA took responsibility for the incident."
 Government action , Immediate response ,"The EPA had notified local residents of the spill 24 hours after it occurred, a delay which the press and local officials criticized."

 Government action , Immediate response ,"reported, 17 days after the spill: ""In the wake of the spill, it has typically taken days to get any detailed response from the agency.""On August 8, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper declared a disaster, as did Navajo President Russell Begaye.On August 11, New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez also declared a state of emergency, after having viewed the affected river from a helicopter, and said her administration was ready to seek legal action against the EPA.Multiple municipalities and jurisdictions along the course of the river, including the Navajo Nation, stopped drawing drinking water from the Animas River because of heavy metal contamination."
 Government action , Immediate response ,"President Begaye advised his people with livestock and farming against signing a form from the EPA saying that the Environmental Protection Agency is not responsible for the damage to crops and livestock. Despite assurances of safety from both the U.S. EPA and the Navajo Nation EPA, farmers of the Navajo Nation, on August 22, voted unanimously to refrain from using water from the Animas River for one year, overruling Begaye's plan to reopen irrigation canals.Following the spill, the local governments of Silverton and San Juan County decided to accept Superfund money to fully remediate the mine."
 Government action , Immediate response ,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) rejected a request by the Navajo Nation to appoint a disaster-recovery coordinator.A $1.5M water treatment plant built by the EPA to treat acid mine drainage from the Gold King Mine began operation in October 2015. In June 2018, the EPA proposed a $10 million interim clean-up plan that was met with criticism for showing no actual benefit."
 Government action , Immediate response ,"Peter Butler of the Animas River Stakeholders Group wrote, ""why is EPA not prioritizing where it can get the 'biggest bang for the buck' in terms of dollars spent for mine remediation?"" and suggested that the speed of ""Superfund clean-ups"" may have supplanted local political interests. In April 2018, the Associated Press reported that the EPA was ""running its treatment plant at a fraction of capacity"" and that ""more than 350 million gallons (1.3 billion liters)—150 times the volume of the Gold King spill—have flowed around the treatment plant into a tributary of the Animas"" since October 2015."
 Government action , EPA involvement ,"After the initial spill had occurred, EPA supervisors were not contacted by the contractors who caused the spill until an hour after the blowout. There was no press release informing the state of the spill until around midnight that same day. Residents weren’t alerted directly of the spill until twenty four hours after it had occurred. By this time people may have consumed the water from the river, which at the time contained a higher concentration of metals than advised by national drinking standards in terms of consumption."
 Government action , EPA involvement ,"It was not until weeks after the Gold King Mine Spill that the water was considered clean enough for human consumption. During the time immediately following the spill, the EPA initially underestimated the amount of contaminated water drained into the Animas River and diverted questions about the water assessments of the river. In addition, an EPA administrator did not show up to the Silverton, Colorado area until a week after the spill had occurred."
 Government action , Secondary spill ,"In July 2018, a truck carrying waste water from a temporary treatment plant crashed into a nearby creek in the Gold King Mine area, spilling nine cubic yards of sludge back into the area. The truck was hauling the waste to a new storage facility by Silverton, after a similar plant in Durango ran out of room."
 Monetary compensation , Navajo Nation ,"The effects of the Gold King Mine spill on the Navajo Nation has included damage to their crops, home gardens, and cattle herds. The Navajo Nation ceased irrigating their crops from the San Juan River on August 7, 2015. While San Juan County in New Mexico lifted the ban on water from the San Juan River on August 15, 2015, the President of the Navajo Nation, Russell Begaye, who had ongoing concerns about the water's safety, did not lift the Navajo Nation's ban until August 21, 2015. This followed the Navajo Nation's EPA completing its testing of the water."
 Monetary compensation , Navajo Nation ,"During this time, the US EPA had water delivered to the Navajo Nation. An estimated 2,000 Navajo farmers and ranchers were affected directly by the closing of the canals after the spill. While water was trucked into the area to provide water to fields, many home gardens and some remote farms did not receive any assistance. They suffered widespread crop damage. The EPA and the Navajo Nation are still disputing how to fairly compensate the Navajo for the damage caused by the spill."
 Monetary compensation , Navajo Nation ,"As of April 22, 2016, the Navajo Nation has been compensated a total of $150,000 by the EPA, according to testimony at hearings of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. According to President Begaye, this is only 8% of the costs incurred by the Navajo Nation. According to Senator John McCain, the Navajo Nation could incur up to $335 million in costs related to the spill."
 Monetary compensation , Lawsuits ,"A number of lawsuits have been filed against the EPA since the Gold King Mine spill transpired. New Mexico is seeking compensation in the amount of $130 million, Utah is seeking compensation in the amount of $1.9 billion, and the Navajo Nation is seeking compensation in the amount of $130 million. At first the EPA recommended people affected by the spill to file claims, however they retracted this statement in January 2017."
 Monetary compensation , Lawsuits ,"The EPA is now motioning to dismiss all lawsuits, stating that they have paid enough through the $29 million they have spent to clean up the Animas River and other contaminated areas. EPA officials say they have immunity under the Federal Tort Claims Act and therefore do not owe more compensation.

 Freedom Industries ,,"Freedom Industries was founded in 1992 by Melody, and Carl L. Kennedy II. On December 31, 2013, Freedom Industries merged with three other companies, Etowah River Terminal, Poca Blending, and Crete Technologies. Gary Southern became president of Freedom Industries on December 10, 2013 and remained president until April 2014 when Chemstream appointed a reorganization officer."
 Freedom Industries ,,"The company distributed chemicals used in coal mining.Freedom Industries' Charleston facility was located along the Elk River, approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) upstream from the river's confluence with the Kanawha River, Previously in use by Etowah River Terminal, the facility stored chemicals in 14 storage tanks with a capacity of 4 million gallons. The facility stored chemicals, but did not conduct coal cleaning. Eastman Chemical Company was the manufacturer of the crude MCHM."
 Freedom Industries ,,"Federal and West Virginia state regulators had not inspected the Freedom Industries chemical storage site in Charleston since 1991 when the facility was owned by Pennzoil, according to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP). Under state law, the facility had been required to have only an industrial stormwater permit, which it possessed."
 Freedom Industries ,,"Freedom Industries was required to test the rain runoff every quarter, and send the results to the DEP.Under the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Freedom Industries filed its ""Tier Two"" form in February 2013, which contained detailed information about each chemical it was storing at its Charleston facility. Following its filing of the tier two form, West Virginia state emergency response officials and Kanawha County emergency planners and responders received copies. These entities received copies of the form under law so that its chemical inventory information could be utilized to prepare plans for possible accidents."
 Freedom Industries ,,"4-Methylcyclohexanemethanol (MCHM), or more appropriately 4-methylcyclohexylmethanol, is an organic compound with the formula CH3C6H10CH2OH. Classified as an alcohol, it exists as two isomers with similar properties. MCHM is a colorless oil with an odor of licorice.The amount of reliable information of this chemical is still unknown."
 Freedom Industries ,,"Further data from Eastman's internal studies was released after the Elk River, West Virginia (2014) spill, including the studies upon which the LD-50 estimate was based and one 28-day study of oral toxicity of pure MCHM which concluded that 400 mg/kg doses were associated with erythropoietic, liver, and kidney effects, though these were not considered more than ""minor toxicity"" and the ""no observed effect"" level was considered to be 100 mg/kg/day.[43]Crude MCHM is a chemical foaming agent utilized in the processing of coal at coal preparation plants to remove impurities that contribute to pollution during combustion."
 Freedom Industries ,,"The chemical washes coal in a process known as ""froth flotation,"" which involves the separation of sand-size particles of coal from the surrounding rock within a tank of water or other solution."
 Freedom Industries ,,"MCHM is utilized in about 20 to 25 percent of coal preparation plants in West Virginia.MCHM is not used in the majority of West Virginia's coal preparation plants, because it is only used to produce coal for metallurgical purposes, a type of coal known as ""coking coal"" and most West Virginia plants process coal that is to be used for the generation of electricity.Diesel fuel was originally used for the froth flotation process, but it was replaced by MCHM because of air emissions regulations.Glycol ethers are a group of solvents based on alkyl ethers of ethylene glycol commonly used in paints."
 Freedom Industries ,,"These solvents typically have a higher boiling point, together with the favorable solvent properties of lower-molecular weight ethers and alcohols.46 The spill began on Thursday, January 9, 2014 when up to 7,500 US gallons (28,000 litres; 6,200 imperial gallons) of crude MCHM leaked from a one-inch hole in the bottom of a stainless steel storage tank capable of holding 40,000 US gallons (150,000 litres; 33,000 imperial gallons) and its containment area at Freedom Industries' Charleston facility. The MCHM leaked from the containment area and into the ground, through which it traveled into the Elk River."
 Freedom Industries ,,"The chemical spill occurred 1 mile (1.6 km) upstream from West Virginia American Water's raw water intake at its Kanawha Valley Water Treatment Plant. The Elk River measured approximately 7 feet (2.1 m) in depth at the time of the spill. The spill was noticed around mid morning on January 9 by several Charleston area residents when they began to notice a ""sweet smell""(like Licorice) in the air. DEP began receiving odor complaints from Charleston residents at 8:15 a.m. According to Freedom Industries, two employees noticed leakage from the tank into the containment area around 10:30 a.m. on January 9."
 Freedom Industries ,,"According to the company's president, Gary Southern, workers began cleanup immediately by hauling away the remaining MCHM in the storage tank and vacuuming the spilled MCHM from the ground nearby.However, the DEP, whose inspectors discovered the leak at 11:10 a.m. in response to residents' complaints about the odor, contradicted Southern's claim. When the department's inspectors arrived at the facility, they observed the MCHM leaking through a concrete block containment dike with no cleanup or containment measures underway."
 Freedom Industries ,,"Inspectors found a 4-foot (1.2 m) wide stream of chemical liquid flowing across the floor of the containment dike and into the ground where the dike's wall joined with its floor. According to DEP inspectors, they discovered a pool of clear liquid measuring approximately 400 square feet (37 m2) in size outside of the damaged white stainless steel tank, Number 396."
 Freedom Industries ,,"DEP inspectors also stated that Freedom Industries' workers had set up one cinder block and a 50 pounds (23 kg) bag of safety absorbent powder to stop the flow of the stream of leaking chemical.DEP air quality inspector Mike Kolb described the scene as ""a Band-Aid approach"" and stated further that it was ""apparent that this was not an event that had just happened."" The DEP and the Kanawha County Fire Department had been able to locate the origin of the leak by tracing the smell."
 Freedom Industries ,,"At the time of the leak's discovery by the inspectors, the damaged storage tank contained about 30,000 US gallons (110,000 litres; 25,000 imperial gallons) of MCHM.West Virginia American Water was aware of the chemical spill by noon, but assumed that they could filter it. By 4 p.m., when its carbon filtration system could no longer handle the large amount of contamination in the water and the chemical began flowing through the carbon filter, they decided to report the problem. This they did at 5:09 p.m."
 Freedom Industries ,,"West Virginia American Water concluded that its tap water was unsafe for use and instructed its customers to cease using its tap water at 5:45 p.m. Freedom Industries failed to contact West Virginia American Water following the spill, and West Virginia American Water was instead notified by the DEP.Freedom Industries refused initial media inquiries following the spill. The company's president, Gary Southern gave a ten-minute news conference the next evening, January 10."
 Incident , Local residents ,"Residents were advised not to drink, cook with, bathe, or wash with West Virginia American Water tap water; up to 300,000 residents were affected. The area affected spanned nine counties within the Charleston, West Virginia metropolitan area. The areas affected included Boone, Clay, Jackson, Kanawha, Lincoln, Logan, Putnam, and Roane counties and in the Culloden area of Cabell."
 Incident , Local residents ,"The majority of Cabell County was unaffected as its public water system uses water from the Ohio River, and some residents in Saint Albans in Kanawha County, Lincoln County and Hurricane in Putnam county were not affected by the water ban as they were served by local public water systems.The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources stated that 122 people had sought treatment by January 11 for symptoms including nausea and vomiting. Of those 122 people, four people had been admitted to the Charleston Area Medical Center and one at another area hospital for observation with symptoms of nausea."
 Incident , Local residents ,"On January 12, the number of patients treated at hospitals for their symptoms from chemical exposure grew to about 169. By that evening of January 10, nearly 700 residents had contacted West Virginia's poison control center, reporting a range of symptoms including nausea and rashes. On January 13, the total number of residents who had been hospitalized had risen to 10, and by January 14, the total reached 14, although none were in were in serious condition.By 1 p.m. on January 10, the sweet-smelling odor was no longer detectable, according to West Virginia National Guard Adjutant, Major General James Hoyer."
 Incident , Local residents ,"On January 11, the chief of DEP's Homeland Security and Emergency Response division, Mike Dorsey, stated that 7,500 US gallons (28,000 litres; 6,200 imperial gallons) of MCHM had spilled into the river, 2,500 US gallons (9,500 litres; 2,100 imperial gallons) more than had previously been estimated.The ""do-not-use"" advisory on drinking water from the West Virginia American Water system began to be lifted by West Virginia state officials on January 13, five days after it had been put into effect following the January 9 detection of the chemical spill."
 Incident , Local residents ,"The lifting of the ban started with hospital facilities and extended zone by zone within the West Virginia American Water system. Following the gradual end to the ""do-not-use"" advisory, affected Charleston area residents were instructed to flush water from their pipes, hot water tanks, and the icemakers in their refrigerators."
 Incident , Local residents ,"West Virginia American Water began lifting the ""do-not-use"" ban in downtown Charleston, and would begin phasing in use of the system's drinking water based upon ""priority zones."" By the evening of January 13, 15 percent of West Virginia American Water's customers were permitted to begin using the drinking water.On January 13, a Kanawha County Circuit Court judge issued a temporary restraining order to preserve evidence at the Freedom Industries' Charleston facility."
 Incident , Local residents ,"The order also prohibited the company from modifying in any manner ""any structure, tank, equipment, material or condition of"" its facility, except as necessary to stop and clean up the chemical spill.On January 21, Freedom Industries notified West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection that a second chemical, polyglycol ethers (PPH), was in the leaking tank with the MCHM."
 Incident , Local residents ,"The department said that the failure to report accurately the type of materials and the quantities is a violation of state law.A one-year incident timeline can be found published in the Supporting Information section of a 2014 research paper [1] A case study of the incident can be found published here [2]. This report only includes information that was publicly available as of March 2016. This report does not include the findings and information released by the US Chemical Hazard and Safety Board, US National Toxicology Program, and other academic studies."
 Incident , Local residents ,"Information disclosed as part of these studies indicated more than 100 mg/L of 4-MCHM was present in the Elk River, levels greater than 3.773 ppm 4-MCHM were present in the water treatment plant, among other information. On January 9, West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin declared a state of emergency, and activated the West Virginia National Guard. Governor Tomblin ordered residents within the spill's affected areas to ""continue to refrain from using the water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, bathing and washing."" United States President Barack Obama further declared the chemical spill a Federal state of emergency on January 9."
 Incident , Local residents ,"Following the President's declaration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was directed to provide both assistance on the ground and federal funding for the state's emergency management efforts.FEMA and the West Virginia National Guard distributed bottled water to the nine affected counties. The West Virginia Bureau of Public Health and the West Virginia National Guard began working on a ""long-term"" plan to ensure the availability of water and food supplies for residents in the affected areas. The West Virginia National Guard also provided potable water in tankers."
 Incident , Local residents ,"On January 10, FEMA had sent 75 trucks, each carrying about 4,900 US gallons (19,000 litres; 4,100 imperial gallons) of water. By the morning of January 11, the United States Department of Homeland Security had sent 16 tractor trailers of bottled water to 16 distribution centers around the Charleston metropolitan area. At a news conference on January 11, FEMA officials announced that they had already brought approximately 370,000 US gallons (1,400,000 litres; 310,000 imperial gallons) of potable water into affected areas."

Goodwin stated that a ""negligent release of this kind could be a criminal violation."" On January 10, Kanawha County Commission President Kent Carper announced plans to request that the U.S."
 Incident , Local residents ,"Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board investigate the incident. CSB officials were in the process of reviewing information about the spill and planned to make a decision to deploy to the Charleston area by January 11. On January 11, CSB officials announced they were to arrive in Charleston on January 13 to begin their investigation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration also opened its own investigation of the incident.The Environmental Protection Agency had found no violations and had not taken enforcement actions against the Freedom Industries Charleston facility within the last five years."
 Incident , Local residents ,"DEP did reveal that the facility had been the subject of a previous ""odor complaint"" ""several years ago,"" although the complaint was determined by DEP to be unfounded. Following the spill, the DEP issued a violation notice on January 10 to Freedom Industries for releasing MCHM into the air and violating West Virginia's Air Pollution Control Act and the Water Pollution Control Act, and it subsequently ordered that its Charleston facility's 11 other tanks be emptied and the chemicals moved off site."
 Incident , Local residents ,"By the night of January 9, the West Virginia National Guard began testing the contaminated water in the Elk River. The National Guard utilized its own lab, in addition to labs from DuPont and the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources. The National Guard also requested two additional labs to expedite the water testing process. West Virginia American Water coordinated with DuPont and the United States Army Corps of Engineers to determine the contamination level within its system."
 Incident , Local residents ,"A total of four labs were set up to continue testing the amount of the chemical remaining in the water.On January 12, Governor Tomblin stated that he was coordinating with DEP secretary, Randy Huffman, to draft recommendations for preventing future chemical leaks. Because MCHM was not considered a ""hazardous"" chemical, Freedom Industries' Charleston facility was not inspected by the DEP. Another West Virginia regulation requiring chemical companies to provide ""immediate"" notice of a spill leaves it to the DEP chief to determine what ""immediate"" notice is on a case by case basis."
 Incident , Local residents ,"As of January 13, West Virginia state authorities continued their investigation as to which state laws Freedom Industries broke leading up to and following the MCHM spill.The tank that leaked showed signs that it may have been damaged by water that froze during unusually cold weather.On January 9, 2015, Governor Tomblin released a report detailing the state's response to the Freedom Industries chemical leak. The report provides chronological detail of each state agency and commission's role in responding to the state of emergency and includes several questionnaires completed by state workers directly involved in the response."
 Incident , Local residents ,"The chemical released was ""crude MCHM,"" which was intended for use as a foaming/wash agent to aid in the processing of coal. Little is known about MCHM's potential effects on human health, nor about its effects on aquatic environments. While its manufacturer, Eastman Chemical Company, is required by law to produce a safety data sheet (SDS), much of the information in the data sheet is incomplete, according to a report by the Christian Science Monitor. Contaminated water smelled sweet, resembling licorice."
 Incident , Local residents ,"According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, if consumed the chemical may provoke the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headaches, diarrhea, reddened/burning skin and/or eyes, itching, and rashes. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists stated that MCHM caused headaches, eye and skin irritation, and difficulty breathing from prolonged exposures at high concentrations.Both health and company officials have stated the chemical consumption is not known to be fatal, even if consumed in its purest form."
 Incident , Local residents ,"The chemical leaked was highly diluted due to the large amount of water involved; however, due to the potential health effects, authorities advised over 300,000 residents in surrounding communities to avoid utilizing the water for cooking, drinking, or bathing. Because shipment of MCHM is not regulated by the United States Department of Transportation, it was not being considered ""hazardous"" by emergency response and environmental protection officials."
 Incident , Local residents ,"However, under the regulatory standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, MCHM is considered ""hazardous."" The chemical's manufacturer, Eastman Chemical Company, identified it as a ""skin irritant that could be potentially harmful if ingested."" The Eastman Chemical Company's material safety data sheet for crude MCHM identifies hazards, included skin and eye irritation, and at elevated temperatures, irritation of the eyes and of the respiratory tract.The median lethal dose of MCHM is 825 milligrams per kilogram of body mass, when tested in rats."
 Incident , Local residents ,"The president of West Virginia American Water stated that his company was not aware of a treatment to remove the chemical from its system. Because of this, West Virginia American Water began flushing miles of lines within its Charleston area water system, although as of January 11, there was no timetable as to when its system would be safe for area residents to use."
 Incident , Local residents ,"West Virginia American Water's engineers began adding additional carbon and other chemicals to speed the treatment process and move the contaminated water out of its water distribution system.Michael Dorsey, Chief of the DEP's Homeland Security and Emergency Response division stated that tests conducted on water samples taken on the night of January 9–10 showed the concentration of MCHM had decreased from 2 parts per million to 1.7 parts per million."
 Incident , Local residents ,"That finding remained above the 1 part per million recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as ""acceptable."" The West Virginia National Guard continued to test the water every hour and its teams worked overnight between January 9 and 10 to perform tests and report results on both inflow and outflow samples of the Elk River's water. Each test took approximately 46 minutes. Tests conducted over the weekend of January 11–12 at four locations indicated a safe amount below 1 part per million of the chemical."
 Incident , Local residents ,"Despite this, officials continued testing throughout the water system's distribution area into January 13 before ending the system-wide ""no use"" advisory.The chemical's manufacturer, Eastman Chemical Company, maintains that when MCHM is diluted, the compound does not have adverse effects on the aquatic environment. No fish kills were reported following the spill and there was no apparent effect on aquatic life, according to West Virginia state officials. As of 2008, the Elk River serves as the sole remaining habitat for the diamond darter (Crystallaria cincotta)."
 Incident , Local residents ,"On July 26, 2013, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service formally designated the diamond darter as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The potential risk of the chemical spill to the diamond darter has not been reported. As a result of West Virginia American Water's notice that the tap water was unsafe following the spill, Charleston area businesses closed and hospitals took emergency measures to conserve water. School systems within the affected eight counties were also closed. Charleston area residents hurried to nearby stores to stock up on available bottled and packaged water."
 Incident , Local residents ,"The West Virginia Legislature, which had reconvened following its winter break, cancelled its business on January 9. On January 9, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia in Charleston and the courts in Boone and Lincoln counties closed. West Virginia State University in Institute also cancelled its classes for the duration of the tap water outage.Because of the lack of potable water, Charleston cancelled a convention of mayors and city council members from around the state of West Virginia, which had been scheduled to begin on January 13."
 Resulting closures , Litigation ,"As of January 10, the day following the chemical spill from Freedom Industries' Charleston facility, at least eight lawsuits had been filed against the chemical company. The lawsuits were filed on behalf of Charleston area businesses forced to close during the resulting state of emergency and on behalf of all West Virginia American Water customers. The plaintiffs have asked to be granted class action status and are seeking punitive damages and compensation for lost profits during the state of emergency."
 Resulting closures , Litigation ,"A further lawsuit was filed against Freedom Industries and West Virginia American Water on January 10 by a patient whose kidney transplant was cancelled due to the water outage.By January 13, a Kanawha County judge had granted a temporary restraining order against Freedom Industries, and the number of lawsuits filed in the Kanawha County Circuit Court had risen to 19."
 Resulting closures , Litigation ,"On January 17, 2014, Freedom Industries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, requiring a court–appointed trustee to run the company.However, according to the Charleston Gazette, a company ""whose characteristics are strikingly similar to Freedom Industries,"" Lexycon LLC, registered as a business with the West Virginia secretary of state about two months after Freedom Industries filed for bankruptcy. The company is registered at the same addresses and phone numbers as the former Freedom Industries, and is founded by a former Freedom executive."
 Resulting closures , Litigation ,"Freedom Industries' release of crude MCHM into the Elk River was the third major chemical accident to occur in the Kanawha Valley in five years. In 2008, an explosion and fire occurred at a Bayer CropScience facility in Institute, killing two employees. In 2010, toxic gas was released at the DuPont facility in Belle. Following these incidents, a team of expert officials from the U.S."
 Resulting closures , Litigation ,"Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) conducted investigations and contacted West Virginia state authorities in 2011 to establish a program to prevent chemical accidents and releases throughout the Kanawha River valley, known as ""Chemical Valley"" for its history of chemical processing, production, and resulting pollution. The CSB recommended that the safety program be headed by Dr. Rahul Gupta, the executive director for the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department. The West Virginia Legislature and West Virginia state government did not execute the CSB's recommendations."
 Resulting closures , Litigation ,"On January 14, five days after the chemical spill, leaders in both the West Virginia House of Delegates and the West Virginia Senate began investigating the loopholes that allowed the Freedom Industries facility in Charleston not to report the incident earlier. Senator John Unger, chairman of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on State Water Resources, proposed amending the current State Water Resources Management Plan.At the request of Governor Tomblin, DEP Secretary Randy Huffman began examining new methods of regulating similar chemical facilities."
 Resulting closures , Litigation ,"DEP is also examining the establishment of an inventory of similar facilities across West Virginia.On February 10, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of Representatives, held a field hearing in Charleston to investigate the circumstances behind, and the response to, the chemical spill. On January 16, an independent unfunded engineering and science research team from the University of South Alabama drove more than 800 miles from Mobile, Alabama to help residents affected by the incident. The team was headed by Environmental Engineering Professors Dr."
 Resulting closures , Litigation ,"Andrew Whelton and Kevin White, and also included graduate students Keven Kelley, Matt Connell, Jeff Gill, and Lakia McMillan. The initial focus of their effort was to determine the impact of flushing on chemical levels in household drinking water as well as understand the reaction of the contaminated water with various household plumbing materials.When on the ground, the team found that many residents had not flushed their plumbing systems despite being given permission days before their arrival. Contaminated water remained in homeowner plumbing systems, leaving it to contact plumbing materials such as pipes, valves, gaskets, and joints."
 Resulting closures , Litigation ,"Homeowners they spoke with explained that they had refused to flush because of reports they heard from friends that odors caused by flushing could cause negative health impacts. Many homeowners stated no intention of flushing for the foreseeable future. In response, the research team modified the flushing protocol that was issued to homeowners and helped flush residences with these more health protective measures. Dr. Whelton's team then issued new guidance to the affected homeowners on how to conduct a plumbing system flush.On January 20, Dr."
 Resulting closures , Litigation ,"Whelton, his team, and the WV Clean Water Hub briefed the Governor Tomblin's Director of Communications about citizens not flushing after a press conference at the Capitol building. The number of residents that had not flushed their plumbing systems was unknown to the Governor's office. Results of the unfunded research team's efforts have been reported by several news outlets, including CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley, local CBS affiliate WOWK, Charleston Daily Mail, West Virginia Water Crisis Blog, New York Times, Mobile Press-Register, local NBC Affiliate WMPI, and The Huffington Post."
 Resulting closures , Litigation ,"Their testing continues and focuses on the public health and plumbing system degradation issues associated with contaminated drinking water. On December 16, 2014, the research team's completed paper regarding the residential tap water contamination in West Virginia was published in Environmental Science & Technology. It identifies specific chemicals found in residential homes and quantifies the level of contamination experienced by affected residents."

 Facility ,,"After oil was discovered at Aliso Canyon in 1938, J. Paul Getty's Tidewater Associated Oil Company produced oil and gas until the Sesnon-Frew reservoir, the largest reservoir within the oil field, was depleted in the early 1970s. On December 18, 1968, a blowout and fire, destroying equipment but causing no injuries, occurred at one of the wells when an operator attempted to remove two gas-lift valves. Getty sold his portion of the field to Pacific Lighting Company, a gas company, which repurposed it to gas storage in 1972."
 Facility ,,"As opposed to current practice, older wells were not sealed to the surrounding rock formation, including their often more than one mile of steel casing. Today, ""cement from the surface of the ground to the bottom of the well [...] makes the casings stronger and protects them from water."" The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility contains 115 wells tapping a reservoir that ""hold[s] up to 86 billion cubic feet of natural gas for distribution to residences, businesses, and electric utilities in the L.A. basin"". The field is the second largest storage facility of its kind in the United States."
 Facility ,,"Southern California Gas Company said the leak in well SS-25 was discovered ""on October 23 during one of its twice-daily well observations."" Residents of the nearby Porter Ranch reported what they thought was a home with a major leak on October 23, 2015. SoCal Gas ""went from home to home to home, giving everybody the A-OK and [...] didn't admit to having a gas leak until [...] probably around the 28th of October.""Local residents believed the gas blowout started before SoCal Gas admitted to discovering it, and many residents reported having unexplained illnesses a week or so earlier."
 Facility ,,"According to KPCC's website, some residents posted complaints of earlier symptoms on a Porter Ranch gas leak Facebook page.This event has been called a blowout in many news reports and by the Attorney General of California, Xavier Becerra."

 Facility ,,"flow of gas, oil, or other well fluids"" from a well.""As of February 1, 2016, the SS-25 well released an estimated 91,000 metric tons of methane gas."" The Huffington Post said that ""while this gas blowout has prompted comparisons to BP's oil well failure in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 and the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in 1989, experts say this leak will have further-reaching environmental consequences."" The source of the leak was a metal pipe in a breached 7-inch (180 mm) casing of injection well ""Standard Sesnon 25"" (SS 25) that lies 8,750 feet (2,670 m) deep."
 Facility ,,"SoCal Gas had hypothesized that the leak was no more than 500 feet (150 m) down in the column used to move gas in and out of the well. Well SS 25 was drilled in 1953 and initially had safety valves, which were removed in 1979 because the valves were old and leaking. Because the well was not considered ""critical, that is, one within 100 feet of a road or a park, or within 300 feet of a home"", the valves were only removed and not replaced."
 Facility ,,"Multiple safety valves had been removed from the Aliso Canyon/Porter Ranch 1950s-era pipes in 1979, and were never replaced, a fact that was also confirmed by a special investigation into the leak by Congressman Brad Sherman's office. The atmospheric scientist Steve Conley said the wellhead in Aliso Canyon was 61 years old and he was not ""shock[ed] that it failed""."
 Facility ,,"One reason for the casing failure may have been gas flow not just through the tubing, but also through the casing ""in order to meet the demand of a customer"", as told by an injection well expert of Texas A&M University interviewed by NPR.On December 7, 2015, an anonymous video was published that showed a cloud of methane gas hovering over the community of Porter Ranch."
 Facility ,,"The image was captured with an infrared camera, showing the extent of the otherwise invisible plume.On May 17, 2019, the California Public Utilities Commission announced that Blade Energy Partners had completed their root cause analysis of the gas leak that occurred on October 23, 2015. The principal findings from the root cause analysis include: The leak's direct cause was a rupture of the outer 7-inch well casing due to microbial corrosion from the outside resulting from contact with groundwater. SoCal Gas did not conduct detailed follow-up inspections or analyses after previous leaks."
 Facility ,,"Blade Energy identified more than 60 casing leaks at Aliso Canyon before the October 2015 incident going back to the 1970s, but no failure investigations were conducted by SoCal Gas. SoCal Gas lacked any form of risk assessment focused on well integrity management and lacked systematic practices of external corrosion protection and a real-time, continuous pressure monitoring system for well surveillance."
 Facility ,,"Updated well safety practices and regulations adopted by the California Geologic Energy Management Division address most of the root causes of the leak identified during Blade Energy's investigation.On May 17 2019, the California Public Utilities Commission also published a video describing the details of the leak.In response to the report from Blade Energy, SoCal Gas issued a response stating ""Blade's report confirms SoCal Gas complied with gas storage regulations in existence at the time of the leak."
 Facility ,,"Blade Energy also determined that SoCal Gas' updated practices in 2019 and new state regulations address most, if not all, of the causes identified in the report."" Natural gas consists largely of methane, an invisible and odorless greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 86 times greater than carbon dioxide in a 20-year time frame, tailing off to about 29 times the effect of carbon dioxide in a 100-year time frame on a mass per mass basis."
 Facility ,,"The leak initially released about 44,000 kilograms (kg) of methane per hour or 1,200 tons of methane every day, which in terms of greenhouse gas output per month compares with the equivalent effluvia from 200,000 cars in a year. On January 14, 2016, Time magazine compared the 1.6 million lbs of methane released each day to the emissions of 6 coal-fired powerplants, 2.2 million cows per day, or 4.5 million cars."
 Facility ,,"As of January 2016, the latest methane measurement per the California Air Resources Board (Carb) was from December 22, 2015, and had decreased from a peak of 58,000±12,000 kg/h to 30,300 kg/h, the equivalent of more than 1.4 million cars by a different calculation using EPA estimates. The Aliso gas leak carbon footprint is referred to as ""larger than the Deepwater Horizon leak in the Gulf of Mexico""."
 Facility ,,"This single event had a 100-year global warming potential of about 1.5% of the entire annual SoCAB methane and carbon dioxide emissions.Steve Conley, an atmospheric scientist at UC Davis and owner of Scientific Aviation, independently measured the gas emissions. He sampled the air by flying over the site in his single-engine airplane equipped with an analyzer, which is one of only 3 or 4 of such planes in the country. He said the Aliso Canyon flights were ""the hardest [...] I've ever done"" because of the headache-inducing smell and sickening turbulence."
 Facility ,,He
 Facility ,,"doubted the readings initially, and ""thought [the instruments] had stopped working because I'd never seen measurement that large before."" He had coincidentally been contracted by the California Energy Commission prior to the gas leak, and said that if he had not been contracted and ready to go, ""no one would have known how big [the leak] was.""Methane emissions from the Aliso Canyon gas leak were detected by the TCCON site at Caltech within a day of the start of the leak, but researchers at Caltech did not have an explanation for what was causing something ""really weird"" over Pasadena until later."
 Facility ,,"TCCON's monitoring data were used in analyses of the leak to estimate ethane emissions of 7,700 ± 1,700 tonnes using Steve Conley's methane estimate of 97,100 tonnes.Besides methane, the gas leak contained tert-butyl mercaptan, tetrahydrothiophene, and methyl mercaptan, which gives the gas a rotten-egg smell. These odorants have been used for decades and were considered harmless although they can cause nausea and vomiting. In addition, the gas contains some carcinogenic benzene. The pollutants may have long-term consequences far beyond the region."
 Emissions , Effect on local community ,"Local residents have reported headaches, nausea, skin rashes, and severe nosebleeds. About 50 children per day saw school nurses for severe nosebleeds. There have been more than usual eye, ear and throat infections. By December 25, 2015, more than 2,200 families from the Porter Ranch neighborhood had been temporarily relocated, and more than 2,500 households were still being processed. As of January 7, 2016, 2,824 households or about 11,300 people had been temporarily relocated by SoCal Gas, while more than 6,500 families have filed for help."
 Emissions , Effect on local community ,"Two schools were relocated in January.The community of Eight Mile, Alabama had a spill of the natural gas odorant within their community in 2008. Residents continue to experience these symptoms under their long-term exposure to mercaptan. The residents say they got very little of the assistance provided to Porter Ranch residents. Methyl mercaptan is toxic if inhaled according to its MSDS sheet. However, it is considered fairly harmless by government and industry officials. Whether it is the source of the illnesses in Porter Ranch and Eight Mile has been a subject of debate."
 Emissions , Effect on local community ,"By the end of November 2015, SoCal Gas had attempted six well kill procedures to stop the gas flow by pumping a mixture of mud and brine down the well, the last being on November 25. The attempts failed because of ice formation and a high upward pressure averaging 2,700 pounds per square inch (190 bar).On December 4, 2015, SoCal Gas started drilling a relief well to the caprock, 8,000 feet (2,400 m) down, with the help of Boots & Coots, a subsidiary of Halliburton."
 Emissions , Effect on local community ,"The relief well is ""similar to the relief well BP's engineers drilled to stop oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 after the Deepwater Horizon disaster"". The plan was to pump liquid and cement into the main well once the relief well could vent the gas safely. SoCal Gas estimated the first relief well would be completed by February 24, 2016."
 Emissions , Effect on local community ,"SoCal Gas planned to drill a secondary relief well, estimating the leak repair to take up until the end of March 2016.After the seventh effort to plug the leak with slurry starting December 22 had created a 25-feet-deep crater around the wellhead, the danger of a blowout increased. The well needed to be stabilized with tension cables and further attempts to plug the well from above were halted."
 Emissions , Effect on local community ,"State regulators became more concerned about the wellhead's stability.In January, SoCal Gas sought permission to capture the natural gas and possibly incinerate it, but state regulators voted against it, worried about safety.On February 11, 2016, the relief well intercepted the base of the leaking well and the company began pumping heavy fluids to control the flow of gas out of the leaking well. On February 18, 2016, state officials announced that the leak was permanently plugged."

 Emissions , Effect on local community ,"Within two days of discovery, ""a dozen or more local and state agencies were involved"". The California Air Resources Board measured methane on the ground near the well, from towers, satellites and airplanes, communicating results to the California Energy Commission and SoCal Gas.: 1 The Board asked SoCal Gas eighteen very detailed questions about the natural gas, basic leakage rate and leak dynamics.: 4–5 The Federal Aviation Administration established a temporary flight restriction over the leak site until March 2016.

On January 11, four California State senators introduced bills to enact an immediate moratorium on any new injections of natural gas and the use of vintage wells (SB 875), to ensure that SoCal Gas will pay housing, relocation and emergency response costs and prohibit the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) from allocating those costs to ratepayers, and that it will pay the costs to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions from its utility profits (SB 876)."
 Emissions , Effect on local community ,"SB 887 would require all 14 underground natural gas storage facilities to be inspected within the next 12 months and at least annually thereafter; it would also require enhanced safety standards, such as the installation of subsurface safety valves, using new leak-detection technology and development of rigorous response plans.The unavailability of the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility caused insufficient delivery of gas to power plants, leading to a strained electricity grid."

While Knight later called for congressional hearings on the matter, one of his opponents, Democrat Bryan Caforio, quickly seized on the environmental disaster as a central issue of the 25th Congressional race, which according to the Times article ""promise[d] to be one of few closely contested races in the House.""Los Angeles Times wrote that no politician is ""pursuing the issue as hard as Caforio,"" who on January 6, 2016, spoke to a group of disgruntled Porter Ranch residents who attended a meeting co-hosted by environmental activist Erin Brockovich."
 Emissions , Effect on local community ,"Caforio ""aggressively attacked"" his opponent, Steve Knight, for his delayed response to the leak. While Knight stated he did not want to politicize the disaster, fellow Republican Michael Antonovich, a Los Angeles County supervisor who has voted consistently against regulation efforts, was outspoken about his determination to hold SoCal Gas responsible. Elected officials, including Congressman Brad Sherman and Senator Henry Stern, took the position that no decision about whether to reactivate the facility should be made until the health study and an ongoing search for the leak's cause were complete."
 Emissions , Effect on local community ,"SoCal Gas had been repeatedly asking California regulators for permission to resume pumping pressurized natural gas into the ground in Porter Ranch, northeast of Los Angeles, at the depleted oil field, which has continued to be used for storage. Records show the utility was negotiating this step with regulators for several weeks. Since the multiple investigations into the cause of the leak have not been completed, Congressman Brad Sherman insisted that the process of reopening the storage facility must proceed with extreme caution."
 Emissions , Effect on local community ,Aliso Canyon is not deemed ready to resume normal operations by regulators or chief politicians that are involved with the oversight of the securing and cleanup of the leak. Congressman Brad Sherman urged that the gas company be restricted to minimal operations required to prevent power interruptions. The storage field is a primary supplier to gas-powered electric plants. The gas leak has been cited by experts and independent researchers as the largest in U.S. history.
 Emissions , Effect on local community ,"On November 23, 2015, some residents who had been displaced by the leaking gases filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court to require that SoCal Gas disclose information related to the health risks of the gases released. The plaintiffs also had continued to seek damages.In January, it was thought that residents might have filed as many as one thousand lawsuits. On February 2, 2016, Los Angeles County filed criminal charges against SoCal Gas for its failure to report the leak immediately."
 Emissions , Effect on local community ,"The charges include three counts of failing to immediately report the leak following its detection on October 23, 2015, and one count of ""discharging air contaminants"" beginning the same day.On September 13, 2016, The Los Angeles Times reported that SoCal Gas reached a plea agreement with the Los Angeles County prosecutor's office. Under the agreement, SoCal Gas pleaded no contest to one misdemeanor count of failing to immediately report the October 2015 leak and was ordered to pay a $4 million fine."
 Emissions , Effect on local community ,"The resulting settlement between the local Los Angeles prosecutor's office and SoCal Gas executives had ended in a mere misdemeanor charge, the lowest possible charge, which can be expunged. In addition to the negotiated plea deal, SoCal Gas had paid a penalty fine of a relatively small $4 million U.S. dollars, the equivalent of the amount of revenue that SoCal Gas received in profits in less than most average 12 hour time periods during the fiscal year of 2015. The Porter Ranch Gas Leak has been cited often by experts and independent tests as the largest gas leak in U.S."

 History ,,"In 1970, the site was identified as a new source of pollution by the Alabama Water Improvement Commission, and one of eleven industries notified to present plans for ""abatement of their pollution of state waters"". By 1980, the company had gained a permit to discharge treated water into the Spring Creek. In 1986, the company was ordered by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management to clean up a section of the Spring Creek where contaminated sediment had built up, following a treatment process failure."
 History ,,The company received further ADEM orders in 1990 and 1991 in relation to delays in cleaning up contaminated groundwater and closing containment ponds at the site.
 History , Lawsuit ,"In June 1991, the Alabama Plating Company demanded that the costs for cleanup at the site be covered under its insurance's ""comprehensive general liability"" policy with the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, as well as its ""excess liability"" policies with Safety National Casualty Corporation and Ranger Insurance Company. All three companies refused, and were then sued by the Alabama Plating Company, who alleged breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, bad faith, and other charges related to wrongful denial of coverage."
 History , Lawsuit ,"The company also sued Hilb, Rogal and Hamilton Company of Birmingham, Inc, the insurance agency through which they had obtained coverage, for fraudulent misrepresentation and negligence.The Alabama Plating Company had argued that the policy, which covered pollution cleanup costs only in cases in which the pollution was ""sudden and accidental"" which the company claimed its incidents had fulfilled. The contamination at the site originates from a liquid byproduct, created from the electroplating process. This byproduct contained cadmium, chromium, cyanide, and zinc."
 History , Lawsuit ,"A mechanical treatment system, in which the heavy metals would be settled out in containment ponds before draining the wastewater into the Spring Creek, was employed to prevent pollution. However, failures of the treatment system led to a buildup of contaminated sediment in the creek, as well as groundwater contamination. Toxic heavy metals"
 Nitrogen cycle ,,"Nitrogen undergoes the nitrogen cycle, where it is converted into different forms (i.e nitrogen ( N 2 {\displaystyle N_{2}} ), nitrate( N O 3 − {\displaystyle NO_{3}^{-}} ), and ammonia ( N H 3 {\displaystyle NH_{3}} )) through various processes, such as fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. Nitrogen’s impact on the environment is not solely determined on its form within the nitrogen cycle, but the overall concentration of each form. Negative effects on the environment can be observed when these different forms of nitrogen are in excess."
 Nitrogen cycle ,,"The Environmental Protection Agency has set a maximum of 10 mg/L nitrate concentration in drinking and surface waters. When nitrogen in the form of nitrate is in excess, it can lead to a dead zone. A dead zone is a body of water that has a depleted oxygen concentration that is low and can lead to the suffocation of animals. An example of this is the dead zone located off the coast of the Mississippi River."
 Nitrogen cycle ,,"According to NOAA, the 2016 predicted size of this dead zone is going to be approximately 5,898 square miles with a nitrate concentration of 146,000 metric tons of nitrate flowing down the Mississippi and Atchafalaya River into the Gulf of Mexico. Nitrate concentrations have increased significantly (by factors of 2 to greater than 5) since the early 1900s. This is due to the agricultural runoff from the farming states that are released into the Mississippi River. More than half (52%) of the nitrogen concentration comes from soybeans and corn."
 Nitrogen cycle ,,"Proper investigation of nitrite concentration changes and effects requires accurate quantification of nitrite levels The Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) method is used to estimate the concentration."
 Nitrogen cycle ,,"The following equation provides the estimate: ln ⁡ ( c ) = β 0 + β 1 t + β 2 l n ( Q ) + β 3 s i n ( 2 π t ) + β 4 c o s ( 2 π t ) + ε {\displaystyle \ln(c)=\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}t+\beta _{2}ln(Q)+\beta _{3}sin(2\pi t)+\beta _{4}cos(2\pi t)+\varepsilon } (1) where c {\displaystyle c} is the nitrate concentration, β 0 {\displaystyle \beta _{0}} , β 1 {\displaystyle \beta _{1}} ."
 Nitrogen cycle ,,"β 2 {\displaystyle \beta _{2}} , β 3 {\displaystyle \beta _{3}} , and β 4 {\displaystyle \beta _{4}} are fitted coefficients, t {\displaystyle t} is time, Q {\displaystyle Q} is mean daily streamflow, and ε {\displaystyle \varepsilon } is the unexpected variability from other sources. This calibration curve is generated every day and compared to the one for the previous day. An issue found with this is that the discharge changes day by day. This variation of discharge can increase the concentration one day, and the next day, there could be a decrease in it."
 Nitrogen cycle ,,"This can make it problematic to observe the trends in the concentrations. Land use practices in the Mississippi River Basin have significantly decreased the amount of available nitrogen in the soil. This nitrogen is usually in the form of nitrate. The nitrate seeps through the soil and gets into the ground water through agricultural practices such as tile drainage, which eventually makes its way into the surface waters. Nitrate concentration can be dangerous passed a certain level."
 Nitrogen cycle ,,"The water in the Des Moines River is near the maximum legal level of nitrate concentrations for drinking water, and the EPA has declared much of the fish in the river unsafe to eat.Nitrate concentration estimations were made from 1980 to 2010 at a site of the Mississippi River above the Old River Outflow Channel, which is also known as the Old River Control Structure. Its purpose is to flow the water from the Mississippi River into the Atchafalaya Basin in order to prevent the Mississippi River from changing course."
 Nitrogen cycle ,,"This study shows that from 1980 to 2010, the nitrate concentrations remained constant; however, there was a 12% increase in the concentration from 2000 to 2010. The sources of this nitrogen are unknown and the reasons as to why nitrate is increasing in some areas of the Mississippi River Basin while decreasing in others is still a mystery. However, nitrate concentrations were higher during the fall and winter months as opposed to the spring and summer months."
 Nitrogen cycle ,,"This general increasing trend is what leads scientists to believe the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico at the mouth of the Mississippi River is growing.Drainage from crop fields has caused nitrate to leach into groundwater, which has adversely affected some drinking water sources in the Mississippi River Basin. In surface waters, high nitrate levels have led to instances of eutrophication, which have caused dissolved oxygen levels to significantly decrease in affected water bodies including the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico."
 Nitrogen cycle ,,"Furthermore, altered nitrate to silicate ratios have caused coastal marine ecosystems to move away from a diatom based system to a less productive system. A possible way to lower the concentrations of nitrate is to rebuild landscapes. Grass and catch crop buffers and forest buffers are successful at preventing a buildup of excess nitrate. Any increase in vegetation leads to a decrease in the nitrate concentration, due to its uptake into the plant. The wetlands are the natural barrier to this, but they are being rapidly destroyed."
 Nitrogen cycle ,,"The best way to prevent the dead zone is to remediate and rebuild the wetlands off the coast of Louisiana. In order for at least 40% of nitrate concentrations to be removed, 22,000 square kilometers of wetlands have to be rebuilt. This proves to be difficult because that would require 65 times the amount of wetland restorations that has happened over the past 10 years.Changing agricultural practices could help solve the nitrate problem as well. Strip-till farming and the use of Winter Cover crops have the effect of minimizing nitrate leaching."

 History ,,"Alpha Ridge was proposed in the late 1970s as an unpopular project that strained the public participation process to address the needs of a population expansion that would quadruple while it was in operation. The search for a third County landfill started in 1973 with opposition causing the drop of selections at Triadelphia Road and Route 144, Interstate 70 and Sand Hill Road and Henryton Road at Route 99. In 1976 the search centered around the 600-acre Burliegh Manor slave plantation purchased by future Maple Lawn developer Steward Greenbaum. Community members quit the site study claiming they were denied meaningful participation."
 History ,,"When updating the historical status of the plantation in 1976, County archivist Cleora Barnes Thompson added ""It should be stated here that the presence of a landfill in the surrounding area of Burliegh might not be in any way harmful as it will prevent the encroachment of future suburban development and will later provide a large area for a park, recreation or open space"". Protests from citizens and Goodloe Byron against Clarksville, Guilford and Ellicott City sites left Marriotsville as the site with least opposition. Gibes Realty-Woodbrier Enterprises put together an offer of $3900 an acre to purchase land contracts."
 History ,,"The Company owners, Robert and James Moxley were the original land speculators for Columbia and children of former County Chairman Norman E. Moxley. In February 1977 the Gibes-Woodbrier Alpha Ridge site was selected at the end of County Executive Edward L. Cochran's term. His wife became the realtor for the subdivision of Burleigh Manor afterward. Howard County Citizens for Conservation gathered 3000 signatures against the project and sued the county for lack of public meetings on the selection. The suit was dismissed in May with acknowledgement that meetings did not have adequate notice."
 History ,,"In May 1979 the Maryland State Health department granted the permit for Alpha Ridge. The initial site was built on a compacted base without liners. Residents were informed that Alpha Ridge would operate until the year 2000 without expansion and be converted to a park at the end of its collection phase. BFI Recycling service started in 1989 as part of a Maryland initiative to increase recycling to 20% by 1994. The same year a $52 million project was earmarked to bring the landfill into compliance with Maryland Environmental regulations. By 1990, Alpha Ridge operations cost $75 a ton."
 History ,,"In 1992, Howard County proposed to expand the landfill, beyond its original 2.3 million ton capacity. $11 million was budgeted to install cell liners on the remainder of the property to bring capacity up to 6.8 million tons. Citizen opposed the expansion showing documentation from 1978 that the intent was not to expand. Public hearings on expansion in February were emptied by the fire marshal for overcrowding. In 1993, Ecker sought alternatives as groundwater contamination suits were imminent. He proposed a regional trash incinerator facility with Anne Arundel County to provide power to NSA."
 History ,,"On 8 June 1994, the County Council voted 5-0 to start transporting trash out of the county. An Anne Arundel transfer site was choose for the USA Waste residential contract and the historic Trinity Church graveyard in Elkridge was selected as a transfer station for the BFI commercial waste contract by creating a solid waste overlay zoning for the site. Alpha ridge remained in operation as hearings were held about lack of notification for the Elkridge waste transfer facility, and concerns about importing out of county residential waste."
 History ,,"The redirection of waste at Alpha Ridge lost the $60 per ton commercial waste revenue, but reduced the residential collection expense to $33 a ton. Alpha Ridge remains open as a recycling center and transfer station. The Trinity Church trash transfer location was converted to the Blue Stream Housing development in 2014. The Alpha Ridge site was situated in a section of Marriottsville Maryland that was converting from mainly agricultural use to residential development. In 1987 The State granted permission to dig the landfill within 5 feet from the water table."
 History ,,"Yearly water quality surveys were performed only in September 1978 and January 1991. By 1992, 1,600 residents in 300-400 subdivisions drew well water from the Alpha Ridge watershed. Well tests onsite in 1992 revealed contamination from seven paint and degreaser related compounds at eight times the current EPA limits and tetrachloroethene at twenty times the limits. A May 1992 test revealed that the clay lining and bedrock were not adequate to prevent contamination into the groundwater. In January 1993, the County executive claimed he had not been given the results to act upon."
 History ,,"In 1993, the county faced multiple contamination issues, as the older Cars Mill landfill was found to have 390 drums of hazardous chemicals dumped on the landfill years after it was closed. In May 1993, Howard County Department of Planning and Zoning director Joeseph Rutter amends the county water service area to include land around the landfill including a new Donald R Reuwer development on the historic Waverly Plantation."
 History ,,"The director announced the effort was for safety, not increased housing density around the contaminated site, but joined Reuwer's land development company later.The 72 acre park was built on landfill property on the opposite side of the Little Patuxent River that flows through the site. A ten-year plan for waste was produced in January 1994, with a suggestion to continue to receive ash from a regional incinerator. In 1994 the park required chemical toilets due to the potential of groundwater contamination."
 History ,,"In June 1995 The County council debated providing public water hookups to local residents at no cost, or providing loans for the service. Public Works Director James M. Irvin said it would take at least 18 months to provide. A year later resident were informed they would have to pay $4200 each to connect to clean water and would pay the county in 10 years of installments at 6% interest.In 1995 Reston based SCS Engineers proposed a $15 million project to install a 68-acre 40 mm (2 in) thick plastic membrane over the landfill to minimize surface water from leaching."
 History ,,"A series of 150-foot deep wells surrounding the landfill were designed to pump and ""evaporate"" pollutants into the air, then dump the treated water into the Little Patuxent River. Methane gas buildups would be vented to a burning facility. An additional $20 million was budgeted to perform similar remediation at Carr's Mill and New Cut landfills funded by an additional $120 trash tax implemented by Charles I. Ecker. In January 1997, Ecker announced that the plastic cap to keep rainwater out would be reduced to 43 acres (17 ha), excluding sloped surfaces."
 History ,,"Three days later he flew toxicologist Laura Green in to discuss the cancer rates of the community, explaining that estrogen, sunlight, alcohol, asbestos, cigarettes and radiation are also contributors to cancer. Public water was made available for 280 homes in July 1997, with the Council excluding homes built after 1993, stating purchasers should have known the issues with contamination by then. In 1994, Interstate commerce laws were enforced removing local municipalities monopolies on commercial dumping locations. Commercial operators were able to choose cheaper sites other than Alpha Ridge which charged up to $60 a ton."
 History ,,"The County lost a dedicated source of income, leaving a liability. After dumping operations discontinued at Alpha Ridge, Howard County chose to export solid waste by an Anne Arundel County train terminal in Annapolis Junction, Maryland to the privately run King George County Landfill in Virginia. Both sites were developed by Blake Van Leer II and were the first waste on rail facilities in Maryland and Virginia.Howard County has adapted a number of uses to capitalize on the long term liability of managing a landfill site."
 History ,,"The County did not rename the landfill as a park for residential development marketing like the Carr's Mill landfill site, but it did lay out over a dozen unusable dirt streets across the site to camouflage its use on street maps with names like ""main street"", ""manor lane"", ""3rd ave"", ""wind drive"", ""river country drive"", ""howard drive"", ""back road"". A onsite metal recycling program was initiated requiring contractors to provide daily deposits of fill-cover to the site."
 History ,,"1984, the County announced plans to build a $1 million horse center at Alpha Ridge as part of a larger $6.4 million park starting in 1985. By 1988, the project was listed as an unfunded 5-year project on Elizabeth Bobo's capitol project list. Regardless, citizens testified several hours in council hearings to support the project. 1994 a 72-acre park was constructed along the Northern edge. By 2004, the county deer project manager Phil Norman estimated that the park was populated with 123 deer, and recommended hiring a sharpshooter with a high-powered rifle clear the population from the landfill."
 History ,,"In 1995, the county approved a 250 ft Nextel tower onsite with attorney David Carney claiming it would be necessary for 911 use. 1997, the county proposed building six soccer fields with a connecting road on the Southwest corner of the site which was not completed. In January 2002, County Executive James Robey proposed a $10 million fire training center on the same location. Robey announced that plans were withheld until immediately before public meetings to prevent rumors about noise or disruption in the residential neighborhoods adjacent to the facility."
 History ,,"$500,000 in state funds were requested with the executive planning on self-funding if unapproved. When opened in 2007, the facility was named the James N. Robey Public Safety Training Center.The same year, the council voted 3-2 against building its 12th high school Marriotts Ridge High School on the Alpha ridge site. 1999, the County refinances $14.2 million in bonds borrowed to pay for the 1993 capping of the landfill. The project took until 2016 to pay down. The same year a lighted in-line skating rink is proposed on the park."
 History ,,"2002, the county attempted to locate its twelfth High School, Marriotts Ridge High School on the Northwest corner of the landfill, and was requested to look at Wavely Woods but a 3-2 council vote redirected the building to the Mt View Middle school site. 2008 an $150,000 onsite observatory was proposed to house the Paul Watson telescope built in the 1930s. The 12-inch telescope has been operated by the Maryland Academy of Sciences, Baltimore Astronomical Society, and the Howard Astronomical League beforehand. 2010 a $3.9 million Pepco 1059KW Gas to Energy generator was installed onsite."
 History ,,"2013 County Executive Ken Ulman approved a $800,000 food waste processing facility at Alpha Ridge. The facility accepts over a ton of material each day costing $38.50 to process versus $41.50 to ship offsite. The Aerated static pile composting method was developed for sludge composting, but only food waste is accepted for now. 2014, an $30,000 archery range was constructed. A program for 4-10 year olds was developed to bring younger children to the landfill park called 'Lil archers' leveraging the popularity of the movies Brave and Hunger Games."
 History ,,"$843,000 was acquired in 2014 from the county and matching state grants to make improvements to the landfill's parking lot and bathrooms. 2014, Developer NV homes starts marketing over 55 retirement homes on the landfill site at Waverly Woods West.

 Background of PFAs , PFAs ,"Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances – also known as PFAs – are widely used, long lasting chemicals found in many consumer, commercial, and industrial products. Breaking down very slowly in the environment, PFAs have been found in water, air, fish, soil, the blood of humans and animals, and food products around the world."
 Background of PFAs , Timeline of Use by 3M ,"Although processes for the commercial production of PFAs were developed in the 1940s, it was not until the late 1950s that 3M began to utilize them in their products. The first significant success from PFAs for 3M came from the sale of firefighting foam to the Navy in the 1960s. By the 1970s, 3M was aware of the environmental dangers of PFAs and began their ""Pollution Prevention Pays"", preventing over 2.5 million tons of waste from entering landfills. Since then, 3M has continued to use PFAs in a variety of products, with Scotchgard being the most well known and commercially lucrative."
 Background of PFAs , Timeline of Use by 3M ,"Until the early 2000s, waste from the production of PFAs was dumped at four sites in Minnesota, the Washington County Landfill, the 3M Cottage Grove Chemolite Site, the 3M Woodbury site, and the 3M Oakdale site."
 Background of PFAs , Scotchgard ,"Scotchgard is a stain and water repellent applied primarily to fabric and furniture to protect them from stains. Despite making up over $300 million in sales, Scotchgard was discontinued in 2000, with 3M citing issues of environmental concerns and corporate responsibility as the primary reasons. However, just two years later, in 2002, 3M released a new ""greener"" version of Scotchgard which still contained PFAs."
 Communities Affected , Populations ,"The drinking water of 14 communities, over 170,000 individuals, and over 150 square miles was contaminated through 3M's improper disposal of chemicals. Some of these communities include Lake Elmo, Oakdale, Baytown, West Lakeland Townships, Lakeland, Lakeland Shores, St. Paul Park, Newport, and Woodbury."
 Communities Affected , Natural Resources ,"The affected area is surrounded by both the Mississippi and St. Croix Rivers, contains Afton State Park, Lake Elmo Park Reserve, St. Croix Bluffs Regional Park, and Battle Creek Regional Park."
 Communities Affected , Health Implications ,"The health impacts of PFAs remained highly debated and not fully understood [1]. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Center for Disease Control's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) are all conducting ongoing studies to assess the implications of exposure to PFAs on the body and/or awarding grants to universities for the study of PFAs. However, no conclusions have been reached yet."
 Consequences for 3M , Media Coverage ,"Numerous media outlets have covered the environmental issues surrounding 3M's dumping of PFAs since the late 1990s, with most news coverage being local to Minnesota, Like the Pioneer Press and Star Tribune, and some coverage coming from more notable sources like the New York Times."
 Consequences for 3M , Legal Trial and Settlement ,"Following initial discoveries of groundwater contamination in 2002, the Minnesota Department of Health conducted numerous studies –concluding in 2008, 2010, and 2014 – on the level of PFAs found in the bloodstreams of exposed residents. On February 20, 2018, the state of Minnesota settled its lawsuit against 3M in exchange for $850 million. After legal expenses, approximately $720 million will be invested in drinking water and other natural resource projects in the east metro area."
 Next Steps , Mitigation and Remediation ,"3M has invested over $200 million, not including legal settlements, into the mitigation and remediation of PFAs around the world. Their website offers samples of PFAs and other chemicals used in their products to any researchers studying the environment and the long-term effects of chemicals. Based on varying population growth and development scenarios, Minnesota state agencies have mapped out 18 unique scenarios for the treatment of individual families' well-water and municipal water systems."
 Next Steps , Mitigation and Remediation ,"The most expensive of these scenarios has an initial estimated cost of $1.2 billion, which is roughly $500 million more than the funding provided to affected communities by 3M."
 Next Steps , Changes in Practices ,"Although 3M has not used the four primary dumping sites which produced the groundwater contamination for the disposal of PFAs since the early 2000s, they continue to produce products containing PFAs. However, the awareness of PFA contamination has greatly increased the resources provided to their effective containment, particularly in the United States. https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/hazardous/topics/sites.html"
 Campaigns ,,BAN currently runs four campaigns focusing on decreasing the amount of toxins entering the environment and protecting underdeveloped countries from serving as a toxic dump of the developed countries of the world. These include:
 Campaigns , The e-Stewards Initiative ,"BAN's e-Stewards Electronics Stewardship campaign seeks to prevent toxic trade in hazardous electronic waste and includes a certification program for responsible electronics recycling known as the e-Stewards Initiative. It is available to electronics recyclers after they prove to have environmentally and socially responsible recycling techniques following audits conducted by accredited certifying bodies. Recyclers can become e-Steward certified after proving that they follow all national and international laws concerning electronic waste and its proper disposal, which includes bans on exporting, land dumping, incineration, and use of prison labor."
 Campaigns , The e-Stewards Initiative ,"When the e-Stewards initiative was initially started with the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, it was called ""The Electronics Recycler's Pledge of True Stewardship"". In the beginning, the initiative verified a recycler's participation through ""desk"" and paper audits only. The e-Stewards certification, however, has been updated and requires compliance verification by a third party auditor."
 Campaigns , Green ship recycling ,"BAN has teamed up with several other non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including Greenpeace to form the NGO Platform on Shipbreaking. The platform is focused on the responsible ship breaking disposal of end-of-life shipping vessels. The overall purpose of the platform is to stop the illegal dumping of toxic waste traveling from developed countries to undeveloped countries."
 Campaigns , Green ship recycling ,"The platform is focused on finding more sustainable, environmentally and socially responsible disposal techniques of disposing of such wastes, which can be achieved through a system where the polluter will be responsible for paying any fees associated with the legal and safe disposal of ships and other marine vessels. The NGO platform endorses the principles outlined in the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal."
 Campaigns , Green ship recycling ,"Computer recycling Electronic waste in the United States Environmental issues in the United States Metech Announces Support for BAN E-Stewards Program USA's trashed TVs, computer monitors can make toxic mess BAN Founder Jim Puckett expects much more e-waste will be exported from the U.S. once the broadcasting industry switches to digital signals on Feb. 17 and millions of households junk their old analog TV sets.

 Regulation ,,"In the 1950s, 1970s, and 1990s, the United States Congress enacted a series of Clean Air Acts which significantly strengthened regulation of air pollution. Individual U.S. states, some European nations and eventually the European Union followed these initiatives. The Clean Air Act sets numerical limits on the concentrations of a basic group of air pollutants and provide reporting and enforcement mechanisms. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency responsible for creating and enforcing regulations that implement these laws. The effects of these laws have been very positive."
 Regulation ,,In
 Regulation ,,the
 Regulation ,,United
 Regulation ,,"States between 1970 and 2006, citizens enjoyed the following reductions in annual pollution emissions: carbon monoxide emissions fell from 197 million tons to 89 million tons; nitrogen oxide emissions fell from 27 million tons to 19 million tons; sulfur dioxide emissions fell from 31 million tons to 15 million tons; particulate emissions fell by 80%; and lead emissions fell by more than 98%.A 2020 paper published by researchers at MIT found that about half of air pollution and half of the resulting deaths are caused by emissions from outside a given state's boundaries, typically from prevailing winds moving west to east."
 Regulation ,,"Regulation of air pollution is split between federal, state, and local governments. Since 1999, the EPA has used the air quality index (AQI) to communicate air pollution risk to the public, on a scale from 0 to 500, with six levels from Good to Hazardous. (The previous version was the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI), which did not incorporate PM2.5 and ozone standards.) The actual standards for pollutant levels defining ""attainment"" and ""non-attainment"" areas for compliance purposes for six major pollutants are the National Ambient Air Quality Standards."
 Regulation ,,"These are required by law to be reviewed every five years, as new scientific information becomes available on the health and property impacts of pollution. These reviews typically cause political controversy as tighter requirements can have economic consequences for automobile manufacturers and companies that emit pollutants. State and local governments are responsible for enacting and enforcing regulations that achieve the federal standards, by limiting emissions from local sources. Standards for emissions from motor vehicles are set exclusively by the federal government and the state of California under a long-standing EPA waiver."
 Regulation ,,"(California's regulations pre-date the national law, though its standards are still updated regularly.) This task is delegated to the California Air Resources Board; other states are allowed to adopt the California standard or the federal government's but not set their own standards. States also can, and do adopt policies which affect automobile emissions, such as vehicle inspection regimes and encouraging the use of public transportation in general or on high-pollution days (as with the Spare the Air program in the San Francisco Bay Area). Corporate average fuel economy standards are also set by the federal government."
 Regulation ,,"Though they have a significant impact on air pollution, they were originally created in response to the 1973–74 Arab Oil Embargo, and are administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, not the EPA. The United States has a cap-and-trade program for two of the major pollutants, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The Acid Rain Program, as it is known, applies to power plants that use fossil fuels, and was required by the Clean Air Act of 1990."
 Regulation ,,A much longer list of chemicals for which the EPA requires the maximum achievable reduction are covered by the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.
 Regulation , Greenhouse gases ,"Regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act has been the subject of lawsuits. While the EPA has been given clear authority to regulate greenhouse gases, the question of the strictness of these regulations has resulted in the EPA not enacting substantial curbs."
 Regulation , Paris Agreement ,"The Obama administration signed a greenhouse gas reduction agreement with China and then joined the Paris Agreement in 2015, but President Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement on June 1, 2017. President Biden rejoined the United Nations Paris Agreement on January 20, 2021, with the United Nations and its Secretary-General António Guterres accepting and fully re-ratifying the US rejoinment to the agreement on February 19, 2021."
 Regulation , Clean Power Plan ,"On August 3, 2015, the Obama administration unveiled the Clean Power Plan, an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) policy designed to limit carbon dioxide emissions at power plants. It was expected to reduce air pollutants by up to 25%, which would improve health outcomes (such as a decrease in premature deaths and childhood asthma) for those who live near factories and chemical facilities. The plan was expected to negatively impact jobs in the steel, cement, and refining production industries but positively impact jobs in the solar and wind power sectors."
 Regulation , Clean Power Plan ,"On March 28, 2017, President Donald Trump took the first steps to eliminate the Clean Power Plan as he ordered the EPA to review the policy. In June 2019, the Trump administration reversed the Clean Power Plan, allowing coal plants to remain open longer. This has largely left greenhouse gas regulations to state and local governments, some of which have joined interstate greenhouse gas reduction programs. On January 20, 2021, President Joe Biden reinstated the Obama-era Clean Power Plan policies."
 Regulation , Composite wood products ,"In 2009, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) established rules for allowable emissions of formaldehyde from wood products made of pieces, chips, particles, or fibers of wood bonded together with a resin. In 2016, EPA also issued regulations to limit formaldehyde emissions. An outpouring of fugitive dust layered with man-made sulfates, smog, industrial fumes, carbon grit, and nitrates is crossing the Pacific Ocean on prevailing winds from booming Asian economies in plumes so vast they alter the climate. Almost a third of the air over Los Angeles and San Francisco can be traced directly to Asia."
 Regulation , Composite wood products ,"With it comes up to three-quarters of the black carbon particulate pollution that reaches the West Coast. Due to air pollution causing more than one effect it is hard to attribute a condition only to air pollution or to say how much a given source is responsible. However, it is believed that at least 200,000 human deaths are attributable to air pollution and at least a quarter are due to transportation. This compares with the approximate 33,000 from gun deaths or recent average of 35,000 from motor vehicle collisions, which are both also attributable to human technology application."
 Regulation , Composite wood products ,There are also significant non-human deaths and effects.
 Health effects , Asthma ,"As air pollution increases, symptoms of asthma worsen. Asthma's etiology is poorly understood and currently has no cure. There are many environmental factors that attribute to asthma. The main sources of environmental pollution are the burning of fossil fuels in the combustion engines, dust generated by traffic on road surfaces, and biomass used for cooking and heating. In urban areas, there are high concentrations of particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and other volatile organic compounds and can make breathing more difficult."
 Health effects , Asthma ,"The health effects of particulate matters with different diameters are related to the length of those particles staying in the atmosphere and the locations of infection in the respiratory tract Young children who are exposed to air pollution are extremely vulnerable. One reason they are more vulnerable is because the average breathing pattern for an adult is 16 to 20 breaths per minute, while a 1-year-old child has a faster breathing pattern which is 20 to 40 breaths per minute."
 Health effects , Asthma ,"Therefore, children will be inhaling more pollutants than adults.On June 2023, Following exposure to dangerous air quality pollution in New York and Washington, DC, there have been reports of health effects - including scratchy throats, runny noses, and wheezing."
 Health effects , Prenatal Exposure and links to asthma ,"Prenatal exposures to air pollution have influenced respiratory health starts in utero. Mothers who were exposed to PM2.5 weekly during gestation, were likely to have a child diagnosed with asthma by the age 6 years. Many of the mothers exposed to PM2.5 were ethnic minorities (54% Hispanic, 30% black), had 12 or fewer years of education (66%), and did not smoke in pregnancy (80%). Inner-city children from the age of 5–11 years old were diagnosed with Asthma, due to prenatal exposure to phthalates, butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP)."
 Health effects , Prenatal Exposure and links to asthma ,"These phthalates were detected in urine samples from 300 pregnant women.Roughly seven million children suffer from asthma, meaning 1 out of every 10 children, and the rates have been steadily increasing. Among African American children, one out of six children suffers from asthma, which has risen by 50% since 2001. This issue of respiratory problems accounts for 88% of premature deaths in low-income to middle-class counties in America. Population-based studies have shown that communities with a high proportion of African Americans and Hispanics experience high rates of asthma."
 Health effects , Exposures to Airborne Particulate Matter Components in New York ,"In a study conducted by Yale University, 'Environmental Inequality in Exposures to Airborne Particulate Matter Components in the United States’, Hispanics were exposed to 10 out of the 14 pollutants (e.g., 152% higher than whites for chlorine, 94% higher for aluminum), African Americans were exposed to 13 out of the 14 pollutants (e.g., 43% higher for zinc, 25% for vanadium), and Asians had higher exposures than whites (e.g., 103% for chlorine, 69% for vanadium, 64% for nickel). Some of the pollutants studied have been connected to asthma."
 Health effects , Exposures to Airborne Particulate Matter Components in New York ,"In Bronx, New York, 66% of individuals who live in proximity of hazardous industrial facilities and waste sites are likely to be hospitalized for asthma. It has been reported that people who live within 1.86 miles of toxic waste facilities in the United States are people of color and twice as likely as white residents to live within a fence line zone of an industrial facility, contribute to air pollution, safety issues, and health concerns."
 Health effects , Heart Disease ,"In the United States, cardiovascular disease kills a person every 40 seconds. While the effects of air pollution on the respiratory diseases are well understood, air pollution also affects the cardiovascular system at the same level as or higher level than the respiratory system, and the adverse cardiovascular health outcomes in both children and adults are high when exposed to air pollution. Carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, ozone, lead, and particulate matter are also associated with increased hospitalization and mortality due to cardiovascular disease."
 Health effects , Heart Disease ,"Chromosomal damage is high among African American children and their mothers from Oakland, California who are exposed to traffic and regional ozone levels. Coronary heart disease has been one of the leading cause of death in ethnic groups. One study found that PM2.5 exposure increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases by 13%. Also, those who live in the area of lower socioeconomic status have higher risk of cardiovascular diseases caused by PM2.5 exposure.Indoor air pollution, caused by kerosene space heaters, cooking, wall paints, second hand smoke and more, are also known to have an association with the cardiovascular diseases."
 Health effects , Heart Disease ,"This increased risk of cardiovascular diseases by indoor air pollution disproportionately affects the people in the United States. The prevalence of being exposed to secondhand smoke is higher in African American population and lower income population, especially in those who live below the poverty level. On the other hand, the risk of fatal cardiovascular diseases is higher in African American men and women than white men and women. For example, 25% of African American men have 6.67% or greater increased risk of fatal cardiovascular disease while only 10% of the white men have the same level of increased risk."
 Health effects , Heart Disease ,"Furthermore, one county-level study found that median income and education level were the most significant factors associated with the cardiovascular diseases mortality disparities in the United States."
 Health effects , Infection and cancer ,"Exposure to air pollution increases the risk of developing respiratory infections and cancers. Inhaled air pollutants damage the respiratory system and can lead to infections or cancer. Respiratory infections and cancer are related to each other. Having a respiratory infection raise the risk of cancer and vice versa. Also, studies show that the risk of the respiratory infections and cancers caused by air pollution are not distributed equally in terms of race, class, and geographic placement."
 Health effects , Infections ,"Even though the mechanistic association between air pollution and infections is still unclear and require further research, some studies shows that the some air pollutants, including secondhand smoking, ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), may cause the infections. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), children have higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia and bronchitis, if their parents smoke. CPSC mentions that 150,000 to 300,000 children (under 18 month) are affected by the lower respiratory tract infections which leads to 7,500 to 15,000 hospitalizations each year based on the EPA estimation."
 Health effects , Infections ,"Exposure to higher level NO2 or long term exposure to low level NO2 also leads to higher risk for infections.Biological air pollution also can lead to the infections. Small, invading organisms in human body, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites, can cause infections in the pulmonary system. There are variety of infections because many different organisms can cause the infections. The prevalence of the bacterial infections is not equally distributed in terms race of and socioeconomic status."
 Health effects , Infections ,"In the United States, bacterial pneumonia, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria (pneumococcus) which enters human body usually via inhalation, is significantly associated with morbidity and mortality among adults. The risk of being diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia is more than double in African American people compared to white people (RR= 2.40)."
 Health effects , Infections ,"Also the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia in most impoverished African American census area, 20% or more people in the area live below the federal poverty level, is 4.44 times higher than the least impoverished white census area, less than 5% of the population in the area live below the federal poverty level, and 2.12 time higher than most impoverished white census area."
 Health effects , Cancer ,Many studies found that both indoor and outdoor Air Pollution can increase the risk of respiratory cancer. Indoor pollution such as tobacco smoking is responsible to lung cancer. Outdoor air pollution also increases the risk of lung cancer. A study found that the combination of formaldehyde and benzene is responsible for 60% of cancer related health problems in the United States. Air pollutants can also cause other types of cancer.
 Health effects , Cancer ,"Another study found that the hazardous air pollutant (HAP) can cause cervical cancer and the upper aero-digestive tract cancer.The cancer caused by air pollution is not equally distributed in the United States. Cancer incidence and death rates are higher in African Americans than other races. A study conducted in Greater Houston, Texas shows that Hispanics and African-Americans have higher risks of HAP cancer. People who live near the public transit exhibit have higher HAP cancer risk as well. Furthermore, another study shows that highly segregated metropolitan areas have higher estimated cancer risk caused by the air pollution."
 Health effects , Cancer ,"This trend was found for all racial groups, but was the strongest for Hispanics.A study conducted in 2000 used geographic census data and outdoor nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration data to examine the disparities of NO2 air pollution across the United States. The study found that there is disproportional disparities in terms of both race and socioeconomic groups. The people of color were exposed to 4.6 ppb more than average NO2 concentrations than white people. Those who live in below poverty level are exposed to 1.2 ppb more. Lower-income Caucasians are exposed to 3.4 ppb higher NO2 concentrations than the higher-income Caucasians."
 Health effects , Cancer ,"The study also reports disproportional disparities of NO2 concentration exposure by education level; those who without high school education are more likely to be exposed to higher concentrations. Association between NO2 exposure and cancer development has been found in many studies.The disproportional effects of air pollution on people's cancer risk is seen not only in race difference. Within a single race community, there is unequal distribution of cancer risks. Among the Hispanic population in Miami, Florida, the traffic-related cancer risks are unequally distributed in terms of socioeconomic levels and country of origin."
 Health effects , Cancer ,"The Hispanic community with lower incomes are more likely to have higher traffic-related cancer risks. Also, it was found that Hispanics originally from Cuba and Colombia have higher risk of cancer caused by the traffic related toxins."
 Health effects , Central nervous system ,"Air pollution is traditionally associated with pulmonary problems, but it also affects the entire body. Nano-sized pollutants can enter the body by penetrating pulmonary tissue after it is inhaled and enter the blood stream via capillaries. Once inside the circulatory system, the heart will spread the pollutants throughout the body. One of the places these pollutants accumulate and affect is the brain and nervous system. The brain is constantly changing and growing throughout a person's lifetime by reorganizing its synaptic connections in regards to its changing environment."
 Health effects , Central nervous system ,"Therefore, presence and buildup of toxic pollutants in the brain can lead to health problems, diseases, and behavior changes and people living in communities with poor air quality, usually low income, and colored communities, have higher chances of becoming ill."
 Health effects , Brain Development ,"It is found that children living in areas of high air pollution, particularly high traffic pollution, tend to do worse on standardized testing. Black carbon is very small (PM2.5), very light absorbent pollutant that mostly comes from incomplete combustion of fuels. According to a study in 1986–2001 in Boston, children who were exposed to more black carbon did worse on the standardized tests they were given (Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test) in all subjects."
 Health effects , Brain Development ,"In the study, there was also association found between increased black carbon levels, worse testing results and children who primarily spoke Spanish at home and have parents with lower education. A similar study conducted was conducted on inner New York City children. This time, the study looked at polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (PM2.5) which is found in coal, tar, and incomplete combustion emissions."
 Health effects , Brain Development ,All of the children in the study were African American or Dominican and it was found that they have lower mental development index (MDI) scores and greater chances of having cognitive developmental delay than their Caucasian counterparts living in less polluted parts of the city.
 Health effects , Other health problems ,"Air pollution components such as heavy metals and reactive oxygen species can cause central nervous system health problems ranging from neuroinflammation to short-term memory disturbances to Parkinson's. Particulate matter (PM), especially ultrafine particles (UFPM), that make its way up to and stay around the brain also become pro-inflammatory stimulus. This stimulus also leads to neuroinflammation. Human and animal studies show that neuroinflammation leads to neurodegenerative diseases."
 Health effects , Other health problems ,"A study showed that residents aged 54.7 ± 4.8 years from highly polluted cities have significantly higher gene expression for an inflammatory gene in their brain than residents in the same age group from less polluted cities. Though the mechanisms on how PM causes neuroinflammation, many studies hint that there's correlation between air pollutant caused neuroinflammation and development of Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer Disease."
 Health effects , Ozone-Related problems ,"Ozone is produced by natural and artificial sources (vehicles, refineries, plants, etc.). It is a very strong oxidizing agent and when inhaled, it attacks tissues by modifying parts of cells and it can create potentially toxic by products. It was found that there is no correlation between ozone effects estimates for mortality and PM readings of an area. In other words, damage done by ozone and by PM cannot be considered the same. Extended periods of inhaling ozone causes neuron damage and death, motor deficits, and memory deficits in humans and animals."
 Health effects , Ozone-Related problems ,"Certain groups, such as African Americans, have higher chance of having ozone-caused health issues because of their higher ozone exposure. A study conducted in Los Angeles, CA showed that there is a 12-15% increase in chance for a child to be born with or develop autism if the parents lived in areas with high ozone concentration during the child's gestation period. From the hospital records, it was found that majority of those parents were also Hispanic and were low income families. There were less autistic children born in majority white, highly educated, and high income communities."
 Health effects , Ozone-Related problems ,"The same study also found that higher levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO), both can undergo chemical reactions to form ozone, also can increase the chance of Autism in a child. The health consequences of air pollution are often distributed unequally amongst a given area's population, and can disproportionately impact certain groups of people with greater severity than others. Because of this, much research has been devoted to discerning the determinants of increased exposure to pollutants. Three factors strongly correlated with increased risk include: socioeconomic status, education, race and ethnicity."
 Health effects , Ozone-Related problems ,The underlying cause of this inequality may involve a multitude of systematic injustices which dictate exposure to harm or access to healthy environmental conditions. This concept is known as environmental justice.
 Disparities in the effects of air pollution , Race and ethnicity ,"In particular, people of color can be more vulnerable to the detrimental effects of air pollution. Studies have revealed that people of color experience significant disparities in income distribution than their white counterparts. Therefore, many communities of color reside in impoverished neighborhoods and face unequal access to environmental health services and resources."
 Disparities in the effects of air pollution , Environmental racism ,"Certain environmental injustices can be viewed as discriminatory towards communities of racial minorities. The study of environmental racism highlights any disproportionate exposure to toxins or inaccessibility to ecological benefits such as clean water, clean air, and natural resources. Also, environmental racism is concerned with situations in which the government and large corporations target minority communities in order to commence environmentally damaging projects. They find that in these communities, there is often much less resistance and pressure to terminate these projects."
 Disparities in the effects of air pollution , Environmental racism ,"When these projects are undertaken, nearby households and small businesses in these minority communities are negatively affected, sparking health problems among children and an overall decrease in the standard of living. According to the 2014 Census, the median household income for both African-Americans and Hispanics was about $43,300. On the other hand, white household income was around $71,300. Also, over 91% of African-Americans and 86% of Hispanics live in urban areas, whereas only about 70% of whites live in urban areas."
 Disparities in the effects of air pollution , Environmental racism ,"Furthermore, in April 2017, three environmental groups—Environmental Justice and Health Alliance for Chemical Policy Reform, Coming Clean, and Center for Effective Government—completed a study regarding the disproportionate spread of environmental burdens. They define ""fenceline zones"" as areas within the vicinity of U.S. chemical facilities that are at of highest risk of death or injury after a potential chemical accident. They found that the 134 million people living in ""fenceline zones"" are 75% more likely to be African-American, 60% more likely to be Latino, and 50% more likely to be classified as having low socioeconomic status."
 Disparities in the effects of air pollution , Environmental racism ,The study was meant to not underline the idea that the United States government fails to justly protect its communities and but also to push the government to update chemical safety regulations nationwide. These factors greatly contribute to the fact minority exposure to harmful air pollutants ranges from 40% to 60% higher than whites—evan as air quality is slowly improving as a whole.
 Disparities in the effects of air pollution , Socioeconomic status ,Socioeconomic Status (SES) is an individual's or group's sociological and economic status in society. Low socioeconomic status can correlate to a greater risk of exposure to unsafe and unhealthy conditions. People of lower socioeconomic statuses have an unequal access to resources and safety measures while people of higher socioeconomic statuses have a greater access to health and safety resources/measures.
 Disparities in the effects of air pollution , Impact of low SES and air pollution on health ,"People of lower socioeconomic status may more frequently have poor health, thus the effects of air pollution can incur additional health risks and shorter lifespans on this population.In the United States, racial and ethnic minorities, defined as people of color who represent a small portion of the overall population, are socioeconomically disadvantaged, and have a history of past discrimination. There are four recognized minority groups in the United States: Asians and Pacific Islanders, African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans."
 Disparities in the effects of air pollution , Impact of low SES and air pollution on health ,"Those of low socioeconomic status and people of color are more vulnerable to the short term and long term effects of air pollution. Short-term health effects of air pollution include but is not limited to bronchitis or pneumonia, frequent headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Some long-term health effects are lung cancer and respiratory diseases, heart disease, and organ damage, and irreversible nerve damage.People of lower socioeconomic status are found to be more vulnerable to air pollutant, PM 2.5, due to their location."
 Disparities in the effects of air pollution , Impact of low SES and air pollution on health ,"PM 2.5 is an air pollutant, arising from the blend of power plants, refineries, and diesel engines, among other sources, and this particle penetrates the lungs. Communities of low socioeconomic statuses are frequently concentrated in areas near highways, busy roads, and refineries. Therefore, limiting one's exposure to air pollution in an impoverished environment is nearly impossible. Communities of low socioeconomic status face an unequal access to environmental health services and resources."
 Disparities in the effects of air pollution , Factors of environmental disparities due to low socioeconomic status ,They generally divide into three categories: Sociopolitical explanations in which hazardous facilities located in communities where they lack political capital to influence discussions Market-based explanations in which people who live in polluted areas have lower property value Racial discrimination in the placement of hazardous facilities.
 Disparities in the effects of air pollution , Education status ,"In many ways, the socioeconomic status determines the education level that a person can achieve. According to literature, there is a lower rate for students from low socioeconomic status communities to get access to higher level of education compared to the students from more affluent communities. Further studies have indicated that there is a significant correlation between income and educational attainment. Therefore, even though education may not have a direct correlation with the exposure to the environmental injustice, it can still be an indirect indicator of the disparity in the distribution of environmental burden."
 Disparities in the effects of air pollution , Education status ,"In December 2019, the New York Times published a list of 95 environmental rules that the Trump administration was in the process of rolling back or had already rolled back; of these, 25 had to do with air pollution and emissions."
 Trump Administration , Restrictions on the Environmental Protection Agency ,"As of March 2017, the Trump Administration is expected to withdraw the federal waiver that gives the Environmental Protection Agency and California the power to efficiently monitor and regulate greenhouse-gas pollution from car tailpipes. Environmental agents and environmental rights activists foreshadow that this action will certainly spell trouble for California's important climate policy; as well as further worsen the disproportionate spread of negative environmental health problems to neighborhoods of color throughout counties in California statewide."
 Trump Administration , The Paris Agreement ,"The Paris Agreement was an agreement created on December 12, 2015 within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to regulate global climate change as a whole. The Paris Agreement creates policies and regulations for the sustainable development of all regions of the globe with aims of developing technologies that will significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions worldwide as well as increase the ability of all nations to adapt to the multiplying effects of climate change. As of April 2017, 195 countries have signed the agreement and 143 countries have ratified it, already adopting certain policies called upon by the treaty."
 Trump Administration , The Paris Agreement ,"The Trump Administration was pushing for the United States to exit the Paris Agreement. European Union energy officials expressed their concerns that the United States exiting the agreement would have substantial negative impacts on the state of the global environment.On January 20, 2021, the Biden administration reaffirmed the U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement."
 Trump Administration , Energy Independence Executive Order ,"The Energy Independence order was issued by the Trump Administration in order to promote energy resources and economic growth by cutting regulations on energy production such as coal, natural gas, nuclear material, flowing water, and other domestic sources, including renewable sources."
 Trump Administration , Revival of the Coal Industry ,"Trump promised to revive the coal industry and bring back coal-related jobs. To fulfill his promise, on February 16, 2017, Trump signed a bill undoing the Stream Protection Rule signed during the Obama administration. This bill originally helped prevent coal mining from polluting waterways. Burning coal produces air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PMX), Black carbon, and smog. Increase of coal usage would greatly increase air pollution especially in areas surrounding the facilities many of which are located in communities of color and low-income."
 Trump Administration , Environmental Health Education ,"The education status here does not merely refer to the educational background or the highest degree people have earned, but more importantly, the environmental health education. Generally, the population with less education are more likely to be exposed to the impact of air pollution. For example, in the United States, people with a high school degree had 6.2% higher estimated exposure to PM 2.5 compared to those with a college degree."
 Trump Administration , Environmental Health Education ,"In addition to PM 2.5, people with a high school degree or lower are estimated to have at least 10% more exposure to Al, Ca, Cl, EC, SI, TI, V, and Zn when compared to people with a college degree. Therefore, environmental health education could be one of the most effective approaches to raise the public awareness of the environmental issues. Before 2017, the EPA have spent more than $8.7 million on environmental education annually to increase public knowledge and awareness about the current environmental issues and the consequences."
 Trump Administration , Environmental Health Education ,"They aim to promote the popularization of the necessary skills and knowledge for the public to make decisions and participate in activities that lead to the resolution of environmental challenges.As of March 2017, the EPA budget have been severely impacted the condition of environmental education. The 2018 United States federal budget cut approximately $2.5 billion from the roughly 8 billion annual budget for EPA, and the budget for environmental education was cut from $8.7 million to $0.555 million, which is reduced by 94%. One phenomenon that's driving the overall increase in pollution in California in particular is the endless wildfire season."
 Trump Administration , Environmental Health Education ,"After a steady 23-year decline in US pollution levels through 2017, the American Lung Association's State of the Air 2022 report found a sharp uptick in pollution over the past five years."
 Air pollution in California , Los Angeles air pollution ,"Los Angeles has the most contaminated air in the country. With a population of roughly over 10 million, the Los Angeles area is a large basin with the Pacific Ocean to the west and bounded prominently on the north and east by the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains. These mountains, part of the Transverse Ranges, exceed 10,000 feet in elevation and help form a natural trap, confining pollutants in the Los Angeles basin. Diesel engines, ports, motor vehicles, and industries are main sources of air pollution in Los Angeles."
 Air pollution in California , Los Angeles air pollution ,"Frequent sunny days and low rainfall contribute to ozone formation, as well as high levels of fine particles and dust. The strong relationship between AQI and ozone levels may be found on air pollution maps.Air pollution in Los Angeles has caused widespread concerns. In 2012, the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) Survey on Californians and the Environment showed that 45% of citizens in Los Angeles consider air pollution to be a “big problem”, and 47% believe that the air quality of Los Angeles is worse than it was 10 years ago."
 Air pollution in California , Los Angeles air pollution ,"In 2013, the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Riverside area ranked the 1st most ozone-polluted city, the 4th most polluted city by annual particle pollution, and the 4th most polluted city by 24-hour particle pollution.Both ozone and particle pollution are dangerous to human health. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) engaged a panel of expert scientists, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, to help them assess the evidence. The EPA released their most recent review of the current research on health threat of ozone and particle pollution.EPA Concludes Ozone Pollution Poses Serious Health Threats Causes respiratory harm (e.g."

EPA 600/R-08/139F. Helping the area to meet the national air quality standards and improve the health of local residents continues to be a priority for the EPA. One of EPA's highest priorities is to support the reduction of diesel emissions from ships, trucks, locomotives, and other diesel engines."
 Air pollution in California , Los Angeles air pollution ,"In 2005, Congress authorized funding for the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA), a grant program, administrated by the EPA, to selectively retrofit or replace the older diesel engines most likely to impact human health. Since 2008, the DERA program has achieved impressive out outcome of improving air quality. The EPA also works with state and local partners to decrease emissions from port operations and to improve the efficient transportation of goods through the region."
 Air pollution in California , Los Angeles air pollution ,"Both the EPA and the Port of Los Angeles are partners of the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, a sweeping plan aimed at significantly reducing the health risks posed by air pollution from port-related ships, trains, trucks, terminal equipment and harbor craft. For environmental justice, air pollution in low-income LA communities has received more attention. In 2011, the “Clean up Green up” campaign was launched to designate four low-income LA communities- Pacoima, Boyle Heights and Wilmington."
 Air pollution in California , Los Angeles air pollution ,"This campaign aims to push green industries through incentives, including help obtaining permits and tax and utility rebates.Although Los Angeles air pollution level had declined slightly for the last few decades, citizens in Los Angeles still suffer from high level air pollution and current levels are back to where they were 10 years ago."
 Air pollution in California , San Francisco air pollution ,"According to a study by the EPA, the air quality in San Francisco has improved since 2013."
 Air pollution in California , Air Pollution and Low SES Communities in California ,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's interactive online map - EJSCREEN - features the low socioeconomic communities across the country that are more vulnerable to air pollution and its associated health risks. As exhibited in this map, Southeast Los Angeles County neighborhoods, primarily impoverished areas in the San Joaquin Valley and Inland Empire, face a higher exposure to air pollution and environmental injustices. In such areas, those in poverty stricken areas have an unequal access to environmental health and safety resources. These poverty-stricken neighborhoods are frequently located in areas that are near freeways, hazardous facilities, and/or rail yards."
 Air pollution in California , Diabetes in Los Angeles County Latino children ,"In 2017, researchers found that diabetes in Latino children living in Los Angeles is linked to air quality. A study led by the University of Southern California was the first of its kind to follow the health and residential air pollution levels of the same children over a span of several years. The subjects of the study were overweight Latino children, between the ages of eight and fifteen, residing in areas with elevated particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide levels, air pollutants caused nearby power plants and high-volume vehicle traffic."
 Air pollution in California , Diabetes in Los Angeles County Latino children ,"The results demonstrated that the children possessed significantly increased risk factors for Type 2 diabetes by the time they turned eighteen, such as diminished efficiency in the insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas. The insulin resistance that results from such a condition is a direct cause of diabetes onset.Diabetes mellitus is a disease that is characterized by the body's inability to properly regulate blood glucose (or blood sugar) levels. Prolonged levels of high blood sugar may lead to severe health complications such as heart disease, nerve damage, kidney failure, blindness, or even early death."
 Air pollution in California , Diabetes in Los Angeles County Latino children ,"As diabetes becomes a rising epidemic, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that up to nearly 8 million U.S. citizens may have undiagnosed diabetes or its precursor. Conventional medical findings suggest that unhealthy or calorie-dense diets, lack of physical activity, and family history are risk factors for developing the disease; however, recent studies are beginning to trace a connection between Type 2 diabetes and the external factor of air pollution."
 Air pollution in California , Diabetes in Los Angeles County Latino children ,"Because socioeconomic status, race, and exposure to air pollution are frequently correlated, the CDC acknowledges certain socioeconomic conditions or races as pre-existing risk factors for Type 2 diabetes, in addition to those previously listed. Statistics suggest that Hispanic people are 50% more likely to die from diabetes than whites, and studies focusing on issues of environmental injustice are able to demonstrate possible reasons for this disparity."
 Air pollution in California , Proximity of schools to vehicle traffic in Culver City ,"The spatial arrangement of Californian communities plays a large role in determining exposure to the concentrated air pollution of the state's southern regions. In one suburb of Los Angeles, El Marino Language School sits adjacent to the ten-lane Interstate 405. Students of schools like these, often elementary-aged, are subject to dramatically increased levels of pollution from automobile emissions, including carcinogenic compounds. Health effects of traffic pollution include the onset of cardiovascular disease, asthma, impaired lung function, premature death, and a plethora of other complications."
 Air pollution in California , Proximity of schools to vehicle traffic in Culver City ,"Furthermore, the incomplete development of children's sensitive respiratory systems leads to compounded effects of air pollution when compared with the health effects of the same pollution on adults.Though the health consequences of vehicle pollution are widely recognized and some legislation has been enacted to reduce its impact, very little tangible action has actually been taken. In 2003, California passed Senate Bill No. 352, which banned the construction of new schools within 500 feet of freeways with certain exceptions."
 Air pollution in California , Proximity of schools to vehicle traffic in Culver City ,"However, the bill remained largely ignored as 1 in 5 schools opened between 2014 and 2015 were still in direct violation of the ban. In 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency released a report titled ""Best Practices for Reducing Near-Road Pollution Exposure at Schools"", available both online and in-print. However, without any requirements regarding school siting from the U.S. Department of Education, state-funded schools are under no obligation to follow its guidelines."
 Air pollution in California , Proximity of schools to vehicle traffic in Culver City ,"The reluctance of public schools to comply with safety regulations often stems from monetary limitations that encourage the use of cheap land, a dilemma that disproportionately impacts children of poorer areas; the report noted that minority and low-income students have a higher prevalence of attendance in public schools of urban areas, such as the big cities in which busy roads and schools share territory."
 Air pollution in California , Fracking violations in Kern County school zones ,"Oil fracking is a process that involves a high pressure injection of fluid into the ground to extract oil. The adverse environmental effects of this natural gas extraction are the subject of much controversy, the primary concerns of which surround the contamination of surrounding water and air sources. These risks result when underground drinking water and surface water are exposed to discharges of the chemically-infused fracking fluid due to faulty construction or operation, disposal leaks, or other unintended byproducts like the release of hazardous volatile compounds into the air."
 Air pollution in California , Fracking violations in Kern County school zones ,"In terms of air pollution, ""hydrofracking"" causes detriment to both the environment and human health. Enormous quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas, escape into the ozone layer of Earth's atmosphere during the extraction process, where they accelerate the impacts of climate change."
 Air pollution in California , Fracking violations in Kern County school zones ,"Furthermore, air contaminants like nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, formaldehydes, and hydrogen sulfide that are released during drilling have been shown to cause harmful effects ranging from cancer, organ failure, neurological issues, to birth defects.In 2015, a study revealed that there are forty-five fracking sites within 1.5 miles of one junior high in the town of Shafter, one of California's top ten most polluted communities. The students of this community suffer from the state's decision to allow oil companies to continue hydraulic fracturing within close proximity of their schools."
 Air pollution in California , Fracking violations in Kern County school zones ,"Parents observe severe and unexplainable health complications amongst their children, including asthma and epilepsy, that may be correlated with air toxins from the nearby wells. In all of Kern County, in which Shafter is located, a staggering ten school districts sit within one mile of fracking wells. The situation becomes even more problematic when the fact that Kern County is predominantly Latino in racial/ethnic composition is considered; in fact, 20% or more of its residents are foreign-born emigrants of Asia and Latin America."
 Air pollution in California , Fracking violations in Kern County school zones ,"Some argue that the concentration of fracking sites around the community's population of color is a discriminatory practice in direct violation of California Code 11135, which states that no person shall be unlawfully subjected to discrimination by any state or state-funded agency on the basis of race or ethnic group identification."
 Air pollution in California , Inequalities in cumulative environmental burdens among three urbanized counties in California ,"In 2012, this research used the method of cumulative environmental hazard inequality Index (CEHII), which is a model developed to environmental inequality in air pollution hazards., to analyze the environmental inequality in three counties in California: Alameda, San Diego and Los Angeles (Jason et al. 2012). In addition to frequently used air pollution parameter like NO2, PM 2.5 and diesel PM, a metric of heat stress was included for the analysis because excessive heat weather comes to be an environmental problem that can threaten human health."
 Air pollution in California , Inequalities in cumulative environmental burdens among three urbanized counties in California ,"The result indicated that color community bear greater air pollution including NO2, PM 2.5, PM 10, and heat stress compared to predominantly white and more affluent community. In San Diego County, the relative heat stress inequality was founded to be the highest. Also, significant heat stress inequality was observed in Los Angeles. The result shows that in these two counties, there was a strong positive correlation between the percentage of Non-Whites in the community and heat stress inequality. However, in Alameda county, the result indicated an opposite pattern which indicates."
 Air pollution in California , Inequalities in cumulative environmental burdens among three urbanized counties in California ,"The community with a higher White population experience more extreme temperature exceedances. This might be explained by the fact that White population and the more affluent class in Alameda County mainly lived in the eastern area further away from the coast, which resulted in the higher heat stress exposure. Also, the research verified that poverty status is consistent with the trend of disproportion burden of the racial-ethnic status."
 Air pollution in California , Inequalities in cumulative environmental burdens among three urbanized counties in California ,"As the analysis was conducted according to the poverty status instead of racial-ethnic status for air pollutants NO2, PM2.5, and diesel PM, the results indicated the similar result as the analysis to heat stress. Furthermore, from our data, we found a strong correlation between poverty and proportion of non-white population (Alameda: r=0.69, Los Angeles: r=0.77). After all, this research demonstrates that the air pollution is disproportionally distributed according to the socioeconomic and racial-ethnic status in the United States. As a future direction of study, it plans to classify the inequality exists in African American, Hispanic, Asian, and other ethnic groups."
 Air pollution in California , Inequalities in cumulative environmental burdens among three urbanized counties in California ,"Furthermore, the technique used in this research provided a way to assess environmental inequality and the results can be used to assist decision makers in efforts to address environmental inequality issues."
 Air pollution in California , Proposed coal terminal in West Oakland ,"In February 2016, the city of Oakland publicly announced construction plans for the Oakland Bulk and Oversized Terminal, a bulk exporting facility in West Oakland. As a predominantly Latino and African-American community, the residents of West Oakland live in a community that suffers from dangerous levels of air pollution. The construction of this port and its proposed partnership with Utah's coal-mining counties would rank the city as the lead coal exporter on the West Coast."
 Air pollution in California , Proposed coal terminal in West Oakland ,"To fund such a goliath project in the face of strong resistance from city councils fighting to protect their local communities from drastically increasing pollution emissions, Utah state and county officials arranged a controversial $53 million loan. The fund, composed of taxpayer dollars intended for local projects, would allow for the annual shipping of 9 million tons of coal through Oakland and an increase in national coal exports by 19%."
 Air pollution in California , Proposed coal terminal in West Oakland ,"A movement by environmental advocates quickly grew, citing that exposure to toxic coal dust would also subject the city's residents to increased risks of bronchitis, pneumonia, heart disease, emphysema, and more.In response, thousands of Oakland residents and environmental rights activists worked together to prevent the construction of the coal terminal. In July 2016, Oakland City Council voted to ban coal from being handled and stored in the City of Oakland. The decision marked a large victory for the newly established Department of Race and Equity, an organization designed to protect Oakland's predominantly African-American community from social and racial disparities."
 Air pollution in California , Proposed coal terminal in West Oakland ,"According to the ""Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States"" report issued by the East Bay Community Foundation, those living in West Oakland already encounter five times more toxic pollution per person than residents of the city of Oakland, and children living in West Oakland are seven times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma than the average child in California. The residents of West Oakland are more likely to face both decreased life expectancy and asthma-related emergency room visits."
 Air pollution in California , Proposed coal terminal in West Oakland ,"For a city already bearing a disproportionate amount of environmental burdens, the fight for a coal-free Oakland was a success for proponents of environmental justice.

 Etymology ,,"The name Cuyahoga is believed to mean ""crooked river"" from the Mohawk name Cayagaga, although the Mohawk were never in the region alongside European settlers, so this explanation is questionable. Some think that it comes from the Seneca word for ""jawbone"". This explanation, however, is as uncertain as the Mohawk explanation. A close match in the Seneca language is Gayó'ha'geh, meaning ""on your chin"". The river's crooked form does vaguely resemble an animal's jawbone."
 Etymology ,,"It is possible that Europeans once wished to call it that, but the name ""Cuyahoga"" ended up becoming more prevalent and folk etymology took over, creating an accidental link between the two names that did not actually exist.Early maps from the era of French control of the region, when the Wyandot were the only tribe there, mark the river as ""Cuyahoga"", although the Wyandot name for the river is Yažaʔyeh."
 Etymology ,,"The Cuyahoga watershed begins its 100-mile (160 km) journey in Hambden, Ohio, flowing southward to the confluence of the East Branch Cuyahoga River and West Branch Cuyahoga River in Burton, where the Cuyahoga River officially begins. It continues on its 84.9 miles (136.6 km) journey flowing southward to Akron and Cuyahoga Falls, where it turns sharply north and flows through the Cuyahoga Valley National Park in northern Summit County and southern Cuyahoga County. It then flows through Independence, Valley View, Cuyahoga Heights, Newburgh Heights and Cleveland to its northern terminus, emptying into Lake Erie."
 Etymology ,,"The Cuyahoga River and its tributaries drain 813 square miles (2,110 km2) of land in portions of six counties. The river is a relatively recent geologic formation, formed by the advance and retreat of ice sheets during the last ice age. The final glacial retreat, which occurred 10,000–12,000 years ago, caused changes in the drainage pattern near Akron. This change in pattern caused the originally south-flowing Cuyahoga to flow to the north. As its newly reversed currents flowed toward Lake Erie, the river carved its way around glacial debris left by the receding ice sheet, resulting in the river's winding U-shape."
 Etymology ,,"These meanderings stretched the length of the river (which was only 30 miles (50 km) when traveled directly) into a 100-mile (160 km) trek from its headwaters to its mouth. The depth of the river (except where noted below) ranges from 3 to 6 ft (1 to 2 m). The river was one of the features along which the ""Greenville Treaty Line"" ran beginning in 1795, per the Treaty of Greenville that ended the Northwest Indian War in the Ohio Country, effectively becoming the western boundary of the United States and remaining so briefly."
 Etymology ,,"On July 22, 1796, Moses Cleaveland, a surveyor charged with exploring the Connecticut Western Reserve, arrived at the mouth of the Cuyahoga and subsequently located a settlement there, which became the city of Cleveland."
 History , Environmental cleanup ,"The Cuyahoga River, at times during the 20th century, was one of the most polluted rivers in the United States. The reach from Akron to Cleveland was devoid of fish. A 1968 Kent State University symposium described one section of the river: At least 13 fires have been reported on the Cuyahoga River, the first occurring in 1868."
 History , Environmental cleanup ,"The largest river fire, in 1952, caused over $1 million in damage to boats, a bridge, and a riverfront office building.Things began to change in the late 1960s, when new mayor Carl Stokes and his utilities director rallied voters to approve a $100 million bond to rehabilitate Cleveland's rivers. Then, the mayor seized the opportunity of a June 22, 1969 river fire triggered by a spark from a passing rail car igniting an oil slick to bring reporters to the river to raise attention to the issue."
 History , Environmental cleanup ,"The 1969 fire caused approximately $50,000 in damage, mostly to an adjacent railroad bridge, but despite Mayor Stokes' efforts, very little attention was initially given to the incident, and it was not considered a major news story in the Cleveland media. However, the incident did soon garner the attention of Time magazine, which used a dramatic photo of the even larger 1952 blaze in an article on the pollution of America's waterways."
 History , Environmental cleanup ,"The article described the Cuyahoga as the river that ""oozes rather than flows"" and in which a person ""does not drown but decays"" and listed other badly-polluted rivers across the nation."

 History , Environmental cleanup ,"Mayor Stokes gave Congressional testimony on his and other major big cities' struggles with polluting industries to restore the environmental health of their communities. As a result, large point sources of pollution on the Cuyahoga have received significant attention from the OEPA in subsequent decades. These events are referred to in Randy Newman's 1972 song ""Burn On"", R.E.M.'s 1986 song ""Cuyahoga"", and Adam Again's 1992 song ""River on Fire"". Great Lakes Brewing Company of Cleveland named its Burning River Pale Ale after the event. In December 1970 a federal grand jury investigation led by U.S."
 History , Environmental cleanup ,"Attorney Robert Jones began, of water pollution allegedly being caused by about 12 companies in northeastern Ohio; it was the first grand jury investigation of water pollution in the area. The Attorney General of the United States, John N. Mitchell, gave a Press Conference December 18, 1970 referencing new pollution control litigation, with particular reference to work with the new Environmental Protection Agency, and announcing the filing of a law suit that morning against the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation for discharging substantial quantities of cyanide into the Cuyahoga River near Cleveland."
 History , Environmental cleanup ,"Jones filed the misdemeanor charges in District Court, alleging violations of the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act. There were multiple other suits filed by Jones. Water quality has improved and, partially in recognition of this improvement, the Cuyahoga was designated one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998. Despite these efforts, pollution continues to exist in the Cuyahoga River due to other sources of pollution, including urban runoff, nonpoint source problems, combined sewer overflows, and stagnation due to water impounded by dams."
 History , Environmental cleanup ,"For this reason, the Environmental Protection Agency classified portions of the Cuyahoga River watershed as one of 43 Great Lakes Areas of Concern. The most polluted portions of the river now generally meet established aquatic life water quality standards except near dam impoundments. The reasons for not meeting standards near the dam pools are habitat and fish passage issues rather than water quality. River reaches that were once devoid of fish now support 44 species. The most recent survey in 2008 revealed the two most common species in the river were hogsuckers and spotfin shiners, both moderately sensitive to water quality."
 History , Environmental cleanup ,"Habitat issues within the 5.6-mile (9.0 km) navigation channel still preclude a robust fishery in that reach. Recreation water quality standards (using bacteria as indicators) are generally met during dry weather conditions, but are often exceeded during significant rains due to nonpoint sources and combined sewer overflows. In March 2019 the OEPA declared fish caught in the river safe to eat."
 History , Modifications ,"The lower Cuyahoga River, just west of present-day downtown Cleveland, has been subjected to numerous changes. Originally, the Cuyahoga river met Lake Erie approximately 4,000 feet (1.2 km) west of its current mouth, forming a shallow marsh. The current mouth is man-made, created in 1827, and allows shipping traffic to flow freely between the river and the lake. Additionally, the U.S."
 History , Modifications ,"Army Corps of Engineers periodically dredges the navigation channel of the otherwise shallow river to a depth of 27 feet (8.2 m), along the river's lower 5 miles (8.0 km), from its mouth up to the Mittal Steel Cleveland Works steel mills, to accommodate Great Lakes freighter traffic which serves the bulk (asphalt, gravel, petroleum, salt, steel, and other) industries located along the lower Cuyahoga River banks in Cleveland's Flats district. The Corps of Engineers has also straightened river banks and widened turning basins in the federal navigation channel on the lower Cuyahoga River to facilitate maritime operations."
 History , Ice-breaking ,"The United States Coast Guard sometimes conducts fall and spring ice-breaking operations along Lake Erie and the lower Cuyahoga River to prolong the Great Lakes shipping season, depending on shipping schedules and weather conditions."
 History , Flooding ,"Some attempts (including dams and dredging) have been made to control flooding along the Cuyahoga River basin. As a result of speculative land development, buildings have been erected on many flat areas that are only a few feet above normal river levels. Sudden strong rain or snow storms can create severe flooding in these low-lying areas."
 History , Flooding ,"The upper Cuyahoga River, starting at 1,093 feet (333 m) over 84 miles (135 km) from its mouth, drops in elevation fairly steeply, creating falls and rapids in some places; the lower Cuyahoga River only drops several feet along the last several miles of the lower river to 571 feet (174 m) at the mouth on Lake Erie, resulting in relatively slow-moving waters that can take a while to drain compared to the upper Cuyahoga."
 History , Flooding ,"Some tributary elevations above are higher than the Cuyahoga River elevation, because of small waterfalls at or near their confluences; and distances are measured in ""river miles"" along the river's length from its mouth on Lake Erie."
 History , Accidents ,"On August 25, 2020, a Holland Oil and Gas fuel tanker crashed on Route 8 near Akron and Cuyahoga Falls, killing one individual and causing a fire that leaked fuel into the southern section of the river. The fire was extinguished by the Akron Fire Department and the river section and surrounding area were promptly cleaned up. The fatal road crash marked the first and only river fire incident on the Cuyahoga since June 1969. However, as scholar Anne Jefferson notes:"
 Dams , Former Ohio and Erie Canal diversion dam ,The Brecksville Dam at river mile 20 was the first dam upstream of Lake Erie. It affected fish populations by restricting their passage. The dam was removed in 2020.
 Dams , Gorge Metropolitan Park Dam ,"The largest dam is the Gorge Metropolitan Park Dam, also known as the FirstEnergy Dam, on the border between Cuyahoga Falls and Akron. This 57-foot (17 m) dam has for over 90 years submerged the falls for which the City of Cuyahoga Falls was named; more to the point of water quality, it has created a large stagnant pool with low dissolved oxygen.On April 9, 2019, officials from the U.S. EPA and Ohio EPA announced a plan to remove the Gorge Metropolitan Park Dam by 2023 at a cost of $65 to $70 million."
 Dams , Gorge Metropolitan Park Dam ,"Funding for the project was authorized through the Great Lakes Legacy Act with funds coming from the City of Akron and members of the Gorge Dam Stakeholder Committee, including Summit Metro Parks, FirstEnergy, and the City of Cuyahoga Falls. As of 2022 the planned date of removal is 2026.The FirstEnergy Dam was built by the Northern Ohio Traction and Light Co. in 1912 to serve the dual functions of generating hydropower for its local streetcar system and providing cooling-water storage for a coal-burning power plant; however, the hydropower operation was discontinued in 1958, and the coal-burning plant was decommissioned in 1991."
 Dams , Gorge Metropolitan Park Dam ,"Some environmental groups and recreational groups want the dam removed. Others contend that such an effort would be expensive and complicated, for at least two reasons: first, the formerly hollow dam was filled in with concrete in the early 1990s, and second, because of the industrial history of Cuyahoga Falls, the sediment upstream of the dam is expected to contain hazardous chemicals, possibly including heavy metals and PCBs. The Ohio EPA estimated removal of the dam would cost $5–10 million, and removal of the contaminated sediments, a further $60 million. The dam is licensed through 2041."
 Dams , Dams in Cuyahoga Falls ,"In late 2012, two dams in Cuyahoga Falls, the Sheraton and LeFever Dams, were scheduled for demolition, as the result of an agreement between the City of Cuyahoga Falls, which owns the dams, and the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, which will provide $1 million of funding to remove the dams. On December 12, 2012, the ACOE issued a permit, allowing the demolition to proceed. As part of the project, a water trail was developed. In early June 2013, dam removal began, and ended in August 20, 2013."
 Dams , Dams in Cuyahoga Falls ,"This brought about a mile of the river back to its natural state, removed 35 feet (11 m) of structures, and exposed an equivalent quantity of whitewater for recreation. In 2019, attempts by the city to address increased erosion as a result of the removal of these and other area dams were publicized."
 Dams , Munroe Falls Dam ,"Two other dams, in Kent and in Munroe Falls, though smaller, have had an even greater impact on water quality due to the lower gradient in their respective reaches. For this reason, the Ohio EPA required the communities to mitigate the effects of the dams. The Munroe Falls Dam was modified in 2005. Work on this project uncovered a natural waterfall. Given this new knowledge about the riverbed, some interested parties, including Summit County, campaigned for complete removal of the dam."
 Dams , Munroe Falls Dam ,"The revised plan, initially denied on September 20, 2005, was approved by the Munroe Falls City Council on a week later. The 11.5-foot (3.5 m) sandstone dam has since been removed, and in its place now is a natural ledge with a 4.5-foot (1.4 m) drop at its greatest point."
 Dams , Kent Dam ,The Kent Dam was bypassed in 2004 and was the first dam modification project in the state of Ohio that was made solely for water quality issues. The modification resulted in the river fully attaining the designated Ohio water quality standards.

 Inversions and air quality ,,"Due to the mountainous terrain and cold winters, inversions frequently occur in Utah and throughout the Intermountain West. While inversions are a natural phenomenon, when coupled with community emissions from gasoline and diesel vehicles, wood fires, industry, and agriculture they can cause unnatural accumulations of hazardous pollutants (especially PM2.5). A typical winter in Salt Lake City has about 6 multi-day inversions that lead to about 18 days of pollution above National Ambient Air Quality Standards."
 Inversions and air quality ,,"Pollution for inversions can begin to build-up even when the air is clear.To improve air quality, especially during inversions, there are restrictions on burning wood fires with fines starting at $150 for first-time offenses in Salt Lake County. Emissions can be reduced by using gasoline and diesel vehicles less by more carpooling and taking public transit, less idling, use of newer vehicles (especially clean fuel vehicles), and combining trips. Less use of gas-powered snow blowers, fireworks, gas-powered lawnmowers, and materials with high volatile organic compound emissions such as certain paints can help keep air clean throughout the year."
 Inversions and air quality ,,"Two pollutant measurements of highest concern for health are PM2.5 (or amount of fine particulates with diameters of 2.5 μm or less) of and ozone levels. PM2.5 is usually the pollutant of concern in winters in Utah, and ozone is the pollutant of concern in summers. To try and reduce negative health effects of outdoor air quality in Utah, at risk groups (including the young, the elderly, and those who exercise outdoors) are advised to stay indoors."
 Inversions and air quality ,,"School children in Utah have been kept inside during poor air quality events.Particulates, especially smaller ones such as PM2.5, can enter deep into the lungs to cause or worsen respiratory disease issues, and decrease lung function. Particulates can cross into the blood stream and cause irregular heartbeats, heart attacks, and strokes. Particulates can also cross the blood–brain barrier and cause degenerative brain diseases such as Dementia and Alzheimer's, mental illness, and reduced intelligence. PM2.5 is the largest component of Utah's wintertime pollution."
 Inversions and air quality ,,"Particulates can be emitted either directly (primary) from sources like exhaust gas, wood fires and fireworks, or can form in the atmosphere (secondary) from chemicals emitted from VOCs like fuel and household products (like paints), and gaseous vehicle emissions of NOx.Ozone is helpful to block UV radiation when at high above the ground in the stratosphere. Ozone can damage mucous tissues such as lung linings, as well as vegetation. Ozone can also form from reactions of VOCs or carbon monoxide and NOx."
 Inversions and air quality ,,"Exposure to higher levels of ozone during pregnancy has been linked with an increased risk of stillbirth, infant mortality, and brain disorders.PM2.5 and ozone levels are converted from scientific units (like μg m−3) to air quality index levels. The maximum AQI across a variety of pollutants is often what gets reported. The Utah DEQ publishes AQI levels. Levels are aggregated into groups including ""Good,"" ""Moderate"" (health concern for particularly sensitive people), ""Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups"" (including children, the elderly, and those with existing cardiovascular problems), with higher levels of ""Unhealthy"", ""Very Unhealthy"", and ""Hazardous"" affecting everyone."
 Inversions and air quality ,,"AQI can be delayed by up to a day compared to current conditions. A Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment study estimated 1,000–2,000 deaths in Utah annually due to poor air quality. An MIT study estimated 200,000 premature deaths occur in the U.S. each year as a result of poor air quality, with the most significant contribution from vehicles. The study estimated 461 premature deaths in Utah annually due to high levels of ozone and particulate matter, with vehicle emissions leading to 147 of the deaths annually."
 Inversions and air quality ,,By comparison there were 273 deaths due to motor vehicle crashes in Utah in 2017.About 200 Utahans go to the hospital with severe pneumonia due to particulate pollution each year. Emergency room respiratory-related visits in Salt Lake City increased by 40% during pollution episodes in 2014.
" Pollutants, sources, and health concerns ", Wildfires ,"Wildfires from within the state, the Pacific Northwest, California, Idaho, Nevada, and even Arizona can drastically reduce air quality. In August 2020 smoke drifted in from California fires which caused PM2.5 levels to exceed 90 mg m−3 in Cache County, Utah, over 2.5 as high as the federal threshold level of 35 mg m−3. Researchers were concerned the poor air quality would worsen symptoms from COVID-19. Air quality in southern Utah was negatively affected by Veyo West and Turkey Farm Road Fires in Washington County as well as fires in Nevada."
" Pollutants, sources, and health concerns ", Wildfires ,"Smoke from the Bush and Magnum fires in Arizona blew up into Utah in June 2020.In July 2021 high episodes of pollution were caused from the Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon, and the Beckwourth Complex Fire in northern California. In Salt Lake County pollution levels reached the 'unhealthy category' and even the normally healthy population was at risk for negative health impacts. On August 6 in Salt Lake City smoke originating from the Dixie Fire and other fires in west coast states caused the PM2.5 level to spike to over 100 mg m−3, more than 3 times the federal standard."
" Pollutants, sources, and health concerns ", Wildfires ,The area temporarily had the worst air quality in the world.
" Pollutants, sources, and health concerns ", The Great Salt Lake ,"The Great Salt Lake has been shrinking, exposing more dried lake bed. Researchers are concerned about particulates and arsenic blowing off the lake into urban areas."
 Research , Air quality monitoring ,"Various organizations monitor the air quality in Utah. The Utah Division of Air Quality has been monitoring air quality indicators since 1999 with the Utah Air Monitoring Network. University of Utah scientists have installed monitors on Trax cars on the Red and Green lines in 2015. Though not unique to Utah, Purple Air monitoring network provides particulate levels in real time. Unlike other networks, Purple Air sensors can be purchased and installed by anyone. Measurement campaigns focused on Utah air quality have brought in international researchers."
 Research , Air quality monitoring ,"In 2017 the Utah Winter Fine Particulate Study (UWFPS) involved intensive studies from the air and ground of particulates and their formation in northern Utah basins in winter. Researchers were from NOAA ESRL, the Utah Division of Air Quality, the University of Utah, University of Toronto, University of Washington, and USDA."
 Research , Epidemiology ,"Some of the most recognized globally recognized epidemiological studies of air quality on human health have been performed in Utah. BYU professor Arden Pope has been researching health and air quality for over 30 years. Pope's research began by using changes in emissions from the Geneva Steel plant in Utah Valley in a natural experiment. Pope noted an ""astonishing"" difference in admissions for pediatric respiratory hospital admissions when the plant was not operating. A 2016 study linked poor air quality with blood vessel damage in BYU students."
 Research , Epidemiology ,"An analysis by the Salt Lake Tribune noted increased school absences along the Wasatch Front during air pollution episodes in Utah, though additional research is needed to determine whether or not absences were due to other coinciding incidents. Life expectancy increased by about 3 years from 1980 to 2000 and 5 months of that were attributed to better air quality by Pope. Legislation in Utah in response to poor air quality has been mixed, with some laws and ordinances expected to help, and others expected to worsen air quality."
 Research , Epidemiology ,"The Governor's FY 2020 budget by Gary Herbert recommended $100 million for air quality improvements. Only $29 million was spent on air quality initiatives, but it was more than the typical $2 million.Previously a credit up to $1500 was offered for purchasing clean air vehicles. However, in 2018 SB136 was controversially signed into law by Gary Herbert. The law, which was sponsored by Wayne Harper and Mike Schultz, implements an additional annual registration fee of up to $120 on clean air vehicles by the year 2020."
 Research , Epidemiology ,"The additional fees were opposed by air quality advocates such as the nonprofits Breathe Utah, and Utah Clean Energy which has stated the fees are misguided. Clean air advocates have voiced concerns that the additional fees will slow electric vehicle adoption in Utah and promote poorer air quality. Gasoline vehicles are the main source of pollution in Utah. In 2022 HB 186 sponsored by Harper and Raymond Ward was signed into law by Spencer Cox which will further increase electric vehicle fees to $240 by 2032.On January 1, 2017 most oil refineries in the U.S."
 Research , Epidemiology ,"were required to start meeting Environmental Protection Agency rules for Tier 3 fuels which would reduce NOX, VOC, and sulfur emissions. Due to their smaller size, the five refineries in Utah were exempt from the EPA requirement, and the state of Utah allowed the exemption. The Silver Eagle refinery voluntarily met the requirement in 2018, and Andeavor and Chevron voluntarily committed to meet the standard by January 1, 2020. Holly and Big West (a subsidiary of FJ Management) have not made commitments to meet the standard early."
 Research , Epidemiology ,"Utah lawmakers passed tax breaks of $2M per year for the refineries to meet the requirements early.Utah has been opposed to allowing California to set higher standards for fuel efficiency and for reduced emissions for higher standards of air quality than the federal government. Utah legislators Stephen Handy and Suzanne Harrison have spoken out against the rollback of fuel standards by the Trump administration, citing negative effects of air pollution in Utah on health. Utah senator Mitt Romney has voiced support for greater efficiency standards without supporting the higher standards set by California."
 Research , Epidemiology ,"In 2019 he voiced support for continued use of all energy sources including higher polluting sources such as burning coal.Anti-idling ordinances were passed in Salt Lake City in 2011 with fines of up to $210 for idling for more than 2 minutes. As of 2018, seventy-one cities encouraged idle-free behavior. The laws have led to few citations, but supporters celebrate them for making idling gasoline and diesel vehicles socially unacceptable.The Utah Indoor Clean Air Act is a statewide smoking ban, that prohibits smoking in many public places."

 Description ,,"It is the state's only landfill and receives more than 90% of the state's solid waste.As of 2014, the landfill receives about 750,000 tons of waste per year, which costs about $32 million. It has reached its maximum allowed height and, as it expands outwards to incorporate another 102 acres of land, it is expected to reach capacity in 2038. The agency has explored several options to extend its life, such as cutting the amount of trash it processes, limiting disposal to residential waste, burning trash, and employing temporary measures while waiting for technological solutions."
 Description ,,"It cannot increase its height further without approval from both the town and the Federal Aviation Administration. The last waste composition study of the landfill was in 1990.The landfill is one of the highest points in the state, with ""beautiful, panoramic views of the Ocean State on an autumn afternoon."" It is sometimes mistakenly listed as the highest point in Rhode Island, though Jerimoth Hill is more than 200 feet taller.Gas produced at the landfill is collected and turned into electricity by Broadrock Renewables, LLC."
 Description ,,"Central Landfill is a double-lined landfill built on the site of a former quarry.In 1980, in an attempt to limit out-of-state waste disposal at the Central Landfill, the Rhode Island Legislature passed a law to require that trucks bringing trash from other states have a contract with the Solid Waste Management Corporation, without requiring the company to grant such contracts."
 Description ,,"The landfill continued to accept some out-of-state waste, but in 1986 began to turn away trucks headed to the dump from Massachusetts, which had increased the amount it sent over the border to about 1,000 tons every day.According to Michael O'Connell, former executive director of the RIRRC, when he started with the company in the mid-2000s, corruption was rampant: ""It became apparent to me after about six months this place was just being poisoned from the inside out by corruption. Half the people that worked here were put here by politicians."
 Description ,,"They didn’t feel they had to work, and those who were workers felt like, why bother?"" After a couple members of the board resigned, then-governor Donald Carcieri told other members not to continue going to board meetings, allowing O'Connell to report directly to the governor to restructure the company, removing about a third of the employees and implementing a merit-based business corporate philosophy.The landfill has also encountered some financial trouble due to the success of conservation efforts."
 Description ,,"In addition to the cost of conservation programs, the RIRRC's cost per ton of waste processed has increased due to a decrease in the amount of trash produced by Rhode Island citizens. The fees it charges per ton did not change for about 25 years, since the early 1990s, but set to increase by 47% between 2016 and 2018. Before 1980, the site was used to dispose of liquid industrial waste, contaminating soil and groundwater. The practice was stopped and the hazardous waste disposal area closed by order of the state in 1982."
 Description ,,"In 1986, the entire landfill was added to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund National Priorities List.In 2012 the Massachusetts-based non-profit Toxics Action Center included Central Landfill in its ""Dirty Dozen"" list of the worst polluters in New England.Landfill operations remove some recyclable materials from the waste, and there is a recycling drop-off for public use."
 NPDES permits and DMR reporting process ,,"For permits other than stormwater permits, the agencies issue effluent limitations for specific pollutants, pursuant to the Clean Water Act (CWA). The basis for these limitations depends on the type of discharging facility, the discharge characteristics and status of the specific surface water body receiving the discharge. National technology-based standards apply to many industries (these standards are called ""effluent guidelines""),: 5-14–5-22 and to municipal sewage treatment plants. Some dischargers are subject to water quality-based effluent limitations, derived from water quality standards for the adjacent water body."
 NPDES permits and DMR reporting process ,,"For pollutants not covered by the above circumstances, the agency may set technology-based limitations based on its ""best professional judgment"" (BPJ).: 5-44–5-49 Most NPDES permits require facilities to submit monthly DMRs, but some permits require seasonal or semi-annual reporting.: 8–5 Facilities may collect and analyze samples more frequently, e.g. weekly, and summarize the results for the prescribed reporting period. Permits typically require reporting of wastewater flow and the results of one or more chemical tests corresponding to the effluent limitations."
 NPDES permits and DMR reporting process ,,"Typical monitoring parameters include pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), nutrients (nitrates and phosphorus), various toxic pollutants, temperature, etc. Some permits also require aquatic biomonitoring of the receiving waterbody.: 8–12 The CWA defines DMR data as publicly available information (except for data that would reveal trade secrets). EPA houses DMR data in its Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS)."
 NPDES permits and DMR reporting process ,,"The NPDES e-reporting Tool Discharge Monitoring Report (NetDMR) is an EPA web-based tool that allows NPDES permittees to electronically sign and submit their discharge monitoring reports to EPA via a secure internet connection (NetDMR is the new tool that replaced the previous Permit Compliance System (PCS)). Information from ICIS database is available through EPA's ""Envirofacts"" website and ""Enforcement and Compliance History Online"" (ECHO). The Agency provides a DMR ""Pollutant Loading Tool"" to help users determine who is discharging, what pollutants they are discharging and how much, and where they are discharging."

 Components ,,"The fluidized bed concentrator consists of five primary components: Adsorption tower Desorption tower Thermal oxidizer Carbon transport system Process fans: inlet adsorber, inlet desorber, outlet oxidizer to stack Industrial processes requiring ventilation, including paint booths, printing, and chemical production, exhaust the ventilated air to the fluidized bed concentrator at room temperature. The air first passes into the adsorption tower, where it moves through six perforated trays of clean carbon beads. The 0.7 mm bead activated carbon (BAC) fluidizes in the trays and captures the VOCs as they intermix."
 Components ,,"The saturated carbon beads are passed from the adsorber tower to the desorber tower, where the beads are heated to 350 °F and the VOCs are released. Typically the adsorber tower is many times larger than the desorber tower, leading to an air volume reduction and an increase in VOC concentration."
 Components ,,"The ratio of adsorber size to desorber size is called the concentration ratio, and ranges from 10:1 to 100:1.The concentrated VOC gas stream is sent from the desorb tower to a thermal oxidizer, where the organic compounds are heated to 1400 °F and oxidized, or broken down into carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and by-products. In some cases, small amounts of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOX), and other gases are produced. The primary advantage of the FBC over traditional rotor concentrators lies in its ability to achieve any concentration ratio up to the lower explosive limit (LEL)."
 Components ,,"This allows Honda Alabama's paint shop to switch from oxidizing 100,000 CFM of VOCs in a regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO), to oxidizing only 1,500 CFM of VOCs in a small thermal oxidizer, at a much higher concentration. Reducing the volume of air to be oxidized from 100,000 CFM to 1,500 CFM (66:1 concentration ratio), allows for a much lower energy usage and consequently, fewer CO2 and NOX emissions. Despite an increase in Line 2 production, Honda is realizing a reduction in plant VOC emissions of nearly 60 metric tons annually as a result of the installation of the FBC system."

 History ,,"During the early 1950s, Pacific Gas & Electric built its first two compressor stations in Topock, Arizona, and Hinkley at the southern end of what became its trans-California natural-gas transmission system: a network of eight compressor stations linked with 40,000 miles (64,000 km) of distribution pipeline and 6,000 miles (9,700 km) of transport pipeline. From Bakersfield to the Oregon border, the network served 4.2 million customers. At the Topock and Hinkley compressor stations, a hexavalent chromium additive was used as a rust inhibitor in cooling towers. The water was then disposed adjacent to the compressor stations."
 History ,,"Although the dumping took place from 1952 to 1966 (when Hinkley was a remote desert community with one school and a general store), PG&E did not inform the local water board about the contamination until December 7, 1987.Residents of Hinkley filed a class action against PG&E, Anderson, et al. v. Pacific Gas and Electric (Superior Ct. for County of San Bernardino, Barstow Division, file BCV 00300). LeRoy A. Simmons was the judge. In 1993, Erin Brockovich (a legal clerk for lawyer Edward L. Masry) investigated an apparent cluster of illnesses in the community which were linked to hexavalent chromium."
 History ,,"The case was referred to arbitration, with maximum damages of $400 million for more than 600 people. After arbitration for the first 40 people resulted in about $120 million, PG&E reassessed its position and decided to end arbitration and settle the case. It was settled in 1996 for $333 million, the largest settlement of a class action lawsuit in U.S. history at the time. During negotiations, the presiding judges told PG&E's lawyers that a 1987 study by Chinese scientist Jian Dong Zhang reporting a strong link between chromium 6 pollution and cancer in humans would be ""influential"" in their decision."
 History ,,"In 1997, an article was published in which Zhang retracted his 1987 research. ChemRisk, a firm known to be working with PG&E since 1995, updated his analysis and published it in April 1997 Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (JOEM, the official publication of the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine) as a retraction of Zhang's 1987 paper. It was published under Zhang's name (then a retired Chinese government health officer, and despite his written objection) and that of a second Chinese scientist, Shu Kun Li."
 History ,,"Peter Waldman, reporter for The Wall Street Journal, wrote that Zhang's son was ""outraged"" at ""the idea that his father would willingly have invalidated his earlier award-winning work."" According to the Center for Public Integrity, ""In contrast to the earlier article, the new one concluded that chromium wasn't the likely culprit."
 History ,,"The revised study—which did not reveal the involvement of PG&E or its scientists—helped persuade California health officials to delay new drinking water standards for chromium.""In March 2001, the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) asked the University of California, Berkeley to name a panel of experts to form the Chromate Toxicity Review Committee. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), established in 1991 with the creation of CalEPA, had been located across from UC Berkeley and had maintained academic ties with the school."
 History ,,"A meeting was held on July 25, 2001, to obtain ""public input on the review of scientific questions regarding the potential of chromium 6+ to cause cancer when ingested."" The panel was selected by Jerold A. Last, with Dennis Paustenbach as vice-president, and included Mark Schrenker, Silvio De Flora and John Froines. Paustenbach, De Flora and Froines resigned from the committee and were replaced.On August 31, 2001, the Chromate Toxicity Review Committee (which then included Russell Flegal, Jerold Last, Ernest E."
 History ,,"McConnell of ToxPath, Marc Schenker and Hanspeter Witschi) submitted its report, entitled ""Scientific Review of Toxicological and Human Health Issues Related to the Development of a Public Health Goal for Chromium(VI)"". The committee recommended that reports of chromium concentrations (particularly in southern California) were alarmist and ""spuriously high"", and further evaluation should be handled by academics in laboratory settings—not by regulators.: 29 The report cited the 1987 Zhang article and its retracted 1997 version."
 History ,,"Citing the 2001 Chromate Toxicity Review Committee review in November of that year, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment withdrew its 1999 public-health goal for total chromium in drinking water of 2.5 parts per billion.In 2001, the law firm of Engstron, Lipscomb and Lack filed a follow-up lawsuit on behalf of 900 people alleging chromium contamination in Hinkley and Kettleman, California. Two years later, Senator Deborah Ortiz (who represented the Sacramento area and chaired the Senate Health and Human Services Committee) called a Senate hearing about ""Possible Interference in the Scientific Review of Chromium VI Toxicity""."
 History ,,"At the hearing, Gary Praglin, a lawyer with Engstron, Lipscomb and Lack in Los Angeles, testified about how the flawed 2001 report by the Chromate Toxicity Review Committee adversely affected the firm's court case against PG&E: After the blue-ribbon panel report came out, PG&E came into court, and they told the judge that everything had changed. They were waving the blue-ribbon report—the blue-ribbon panel report—like a flag. They said to the judge, the State of California has spoken."
 History ,,"It has said that chromium VI does not cause cancer by ingestion, and they wanted to amend their paperwork, their motions, their declarations, and move to dismiss our case. And they got that permission to do that. They amended all their paperwork, and we were given permission to take discovery—to take depositions, issue subpoenas—and we have obtained thousands of pages of documents in connection with the blue-ribbon panel process."
 History ,,"Since the Hinkley groundwater contamination lawsuit, a group of California-based scientists with organizations such as the Desert Sierra Cancer Surveillance Program (DSCSP) and ChemRisk have argued against the claim that chromium 6 is genotoxic, downplaying the number of cancer cases and challenging a ""cancer cluster in the Hinkley area"".According to the lawsuit, PG&E was also required to discontinue its use of chromium 6 and clean up the contaminated groundwater. By 2008 the chromium plume was spreading, however, and it attracted media attention by 2011."
 History ,,"In November 2010, PG&E began offering to purchase threatened houses and property in Hinkley and to provide bottled water. By 2013, the plume was over six miles long, two miles wide, and slowly growing.In 2006, PG&E agreed to pay $295 million to settle cases involving another 1,100 people statewide for hexavalent chromium-related claims. Two years later, it settled the last of the Hinkley claims for $20 million."
 History ,,"That year, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) responded to research by the National Toxicology Program on the development of cancerous tumors in mice and rats who had consumed heavy doses of chromium 6.California became the first state to acknowledge a link between ingested hexavalent chromium and cancer in July 2014, establishing a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for hexavalent chromium of 10 parts per billion (ppb). Hexavalent chromium is measured in μg/L (micrograms per liter)."
 History ,,"The EPA does not have an MCL for hexavalent chromium in drinking water, but the agency has an MCL of 100 parts per billion for all forms of chromium. PG&E operates a compressor station in Hinkley for its natural-gas transmission pipelines. The gas must be re-compressed about every 350 miles (560 km), and the station uses cooling towers to cool the gas after compression. Between 1952 and 1966, the water in the cooling towers contained hexavalent chromium—now recognized as a carcinogen—to prevent rust in the machinery."
 History ,,"The water was stored between uses in unlined ponds, which allowed it to percolate into the groundwater. This led to groundwater pollution, affecting soil and contaminating water wells near the compressor station with a plume originally about 2 miles (3.2 km) long and nearly 1 mile (1.6 km) wide. By 2013, the plume was 6 miles (9.7 km) long and nearly 2 miles (3.2 km) wide.Average hexavalent chromium levels in Hinkley were recorded as 1.19 parts-per-billion (ppb), with an estimated peak of 20 ppb."
 History ,,"Based on the PG&E Background Study, the PG&E Topock Compressor Station averaged 7.8 ppb and peaked at 31.8 ppb. The proposed California health goal for hexavalent chromium was 0.02 ppb in 2011. In 1991, when the EPA raised the federal MCL for total chromium to 100 ppb, California remained at 50 ppb."
 History ,,"According to CalEPA in 2015, ""At the time Total Chromium MCLs were established, ingested Hexavalent Chromium associated with consumption of drinking water was not considered to pose a cancer risk, as is now the case."" Samples taken in August 2010 showed that the plume of contaminated water had begun to migrate to the lower aquifer. In September 2013, CalEPA reported that the plume had expanded to 6 miles (9.7 km) long and 4 miles (6.4 km) wide."
 History ,,"In 2015, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region served PG&E with an order to clean up the effects of the chromium discharge. At the time of the report, the plume was ""8 miles (13 km) in length and approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) in width, throughout the Hinkley Valley and into Harper Dry Lake Valley."": 2 By 2013, PG&E had spent over $750 million on remediation. Sheryl Bilbery, in charge of PG&E remediation efforts, explained why remediation was taking a long time. ""It's a very complex project. We are highly regulated. There are a lot of interested parties."
 History ,,"The other thing is it is very important that we get it right.""For their 2013 series Science for Sale, PBS NewsHour journalist Miles O'Brien interviewed PG&E director of chromium remediation Kevin Sullivan. According to Sullivan, PG&E cleaned up 54 acres (22 ha); however, it would take another 40 years before they were done. PG&E built a concrete barrier about a half-mile long to contain the plume, pumped ethanol into the ground to convert chromium 6 to chromium 3, and planted acres of alfalfa."
 History ,,"O'Brien interviewed Erin Brockovich, who was surprised that PG&E had not completed the cleanup it promised over a decade earlier. In correspondence with Sullivan, the Water Board noted that by 2014 ""chromium from PG&E's historical releases at the Hinkley Compressor Station has migrated from the upper aquifer to the lower aquifer causing hexavalent chromium concentrations in the lower aquifer to exceed drinking water standards."" Cleanup documentation about Hinkley is maintained on the CalEPA webpage."
 History ,,"A 2007 toxicity report for the National Toxicology Program provided evidence that high doses of chromium 6 caused cancers of the gastrointestinal tract in rats and mice at levels higher than 5 mg/L of water, (5 ppm, or 5,000 ppb).Average hexavalent chromium levels in Hinkley were recorded at 1.19 ppb, with an estimated peak of 20 ppb. The PG&E Topock Compressor Station averaged 7.8 ppb, peaking at 31.8 ppb (based on the PG&E Background Study). In 2013, PG&E's Sheryl Bilbery told a PBS journalist: ""There's a lot of scientists that are still debating that question [hexavalent chromium toxicity]."
 History ,,"I think that's why the process has taken so long, from what I have read, both at EPA and at the state level. So, I think they're still trying to figure out exactly what is the right answer there."" In July 2014, CalEPA established a maximum chromium-6 MCL of 10 ppb as a result of new research which linked ingestion of hexavalent chromium with cancer."

 Debates , Dennis Paustenbach ,"Dennis Paustenbach has been an expert witness and consultant for a number of companies facing lawsuits over products, environmental practices or product safety. Paustenbach was the founder and director of ChemRisk, and Brent Kerger was one of his senior scientists."
 Debates , Dennis Paustenbach ,"Their clients included PG&E and BP.Paustenbach was at the center of a publishing scandal involving the research of Chinese scientist Jian Dong Zhang, who published a paper in 1987 reporting an association between chromium pollution of drinking water and higher rates of stomach cancer in residents of three villages in Liaoning Province (in rural northeastern China) who lived near a chromium-ore smelter and drank tainted water for years.According to Allan Hirsch, CalEPA's 2008 review of Zhang's 1987 paper agreed with his findings that the rates of stomach cancer in the three villages were significantly higher than those in the province."
 Debates , Dennis Paustenbach ,"PG&E hired ChemRisk, a for-profit scientific consulting firm.According to the Center for Public Integrity, ""[Zhang's] revised [1997] study—which did not reveal the involvement of PG&E or its scientists—helped persuade California health officials to delay new drinking water standards for chromium."" The EPA cited the article when it allowed the continued use of chromium in a wood preservative, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry discounted chromium 6 as an oral carcinogen because of the revised study.In 2006, the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine conducted a six-month internal review of the 1997 retraction."
 Debates , Dennis Paustenbach ,"Although Zhang had died by the time the JOEM made its investigation, his co-author agreed that the revised paper should be retracted.

 US oil shale resources ,,"The United States has not had a viable oil shale industry for more than 150 years, yet it contains the largest oil shale resource in the world."
 US oil shale resources , Eastern resources ,"There are two types of oil shale resources in the United States east of the Mississippi River. The first is cannel coal, which was used widely in Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and western Virginia (now West Virginia) to manufacture oil during the first American oil shale boom, 1854–1861. The cannel coals have since been largely mined out, and are no longer considered a major oil-shale resource. The second category of eastern oil-shale resources are the Paleozoic black shales, of lower oil yield, but of much larger size than the cannel coals."
 US oil shale resources , Eastern resources ,"Most attention has been given to the shales near the Devonian/Mississippian boundary, which are variously called the Ohio Shale, Chattanooga Shale, the Antrim Shale, and the New Albany Shale."
 US oil shale resources , Western resources ,"Black shales similar to the eastern shales are widely distributed west of the Mississippi River. These include some, such as the Woodford Shale of Oklahoma, which are near-stratigraphic equivalents to the Devonian/Mississippian shales of the eastern US. The largest oil-shale resource in the world is contained in the Eocene Green River Formation in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming in three basins: the Piceance Basin, Green River Basin, and Uinta Basin. The Green River oil shales have been the focus of most efforts of the past hundred years to establish an American oil shale industry."
 US oil shale resources , Western resources ,"The Green River oil “shale” is actually a marl, and some beds yield up to 70 gallons of oil per short ton of shale. Estimated in-place resources are capable of generating 4.2 trillion barrels of oil. Although the Piceance basin of western Colorado has the smallest lateral extent of Green River shale, it contains the greatest amount of high-grade shale. Using a cut-off of 25 gallons per ton, the Piceance has about 352 billion barrels of in-place resource.The Elko Formation of northeastern Nevada is an oil shale, late Eocene to early Oligocene in age."
 US oil shale resources , Western resources ,"Like the Green River Formation, it contains beds deposited in a lake. Faulting and subsequent erosion have removed most of the original extent of the deposit, leaving isolated bodies of the formation within an area about 100 miles long and 30 miles wide in Elko County, Nevada.The Phosphoria Formation of Permian age is present in Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana. Some beds were found to yield more than 25 gallons of oil per ton. America faced a shortage of oil – whale oil."
 US oil shale resources , Western resources ,"Despite a steadily growing fleet of whaling ships, the American whaling industry could not satisfy the demand for lamp oil; the price had risen considerably, and the country imported increasing amounts of whale oil. Whale oil was needed as lamp oil for illumination. It burned with a bright, smokeless flame that nothing else was known to match. Chemists had known how to make oil from coal (coal oil) or turpentine (camphene) for many years, but they burned with sooty flames, making them unsuitable for indoor illumination."
 US oil shale resources , Western resources ,"The only viable competitor to whale oil was “burning oil,” a mixture of camphene and alcohol, which burned bright and smokeless, but which was volatile and prone to explode. Fire insurance policies charged higher premiums for buildings in which camphene-based lamp oil was used. The city of Lowell, Massachusetts banned the storage of products containing camphene within 200 yards of any building in the city.The increasing demand for whale oil decimated the whale populations in the mid-1800s."
 US oil shale resources , Western resources ,"The number of whales caught rose each year, until the American whaling industry produced another record amount of whale oil in 1846, after which the whale hunting deteriorated . The increasing number of whaling ships partly compensated for the lower catch per ship each year, but the fleet could never again match the record catch of 1846. The shortage of whale oil caused both the price and the level of imports, to jump."
 US oil shale resources , Western resources ,"As the price of whale oil escalated, scientists tried to create a cheap, artificial oil that would burn with a bright, smokeless flame, safer than “burning oil.” Two succeeded: Scottish chemist James Young, and Canadian geologist Abraham Gesner. Both distilled their lamp oils from coal or coal-like raw materials. James Young made his from coal, and discovered that the coal that yielded the most oil was cannel coal."
 US oil shale resources , Western resources ,"Young filed a patent for his process in 1850, and built a highly successful plant at Bathgate, Scotland making an illuminating oil he called “paraffine,” from the cannel coal that was mined nearby, the Boghead coal, which yielded more oil than any of the other coals he tested.By 1853, Canadian geologist Abraham Gesner had learned to distill a good-quality lamp oil from a rock called “albertite,” found in New Brunswick, Canada. It was a matter if dispute whether albertite was coal or hardened petroleum."
 US oil shale resources , Western resources ,"Gesner moved from Halifax, Nova Scotia to New York City in early 1853, and in March 1853 he circulated a prospectus for the Asphalt Mining and Kerosene Gas Company. The company bought a plot of land in Brooklyn, primarily to manufacture coal gas from albertite imported from New Brunswick, but the prospectus also mentioned that the Gesner's process would also yield 15 gallons per ton of “Kerosine, or Burning Fluid.” The company reorganized in 1854 as the North American Kerosene and Gas Light Company."
 US oil shale resources , Western resources ,"That same year, Gesner received a patent for his process to make a lamp oil he named Kerosene. Kerosene soon became the principal money-maker for Gesner's company."
 1850s – the coal oil era ," The coal oil ""mania"" ","The successes of Young and Gesner attracted a flood of imitators. The Scientific American noted that the number of American companies making coal oil grew from three at the end of 1857, to 42 or more at the end of 1859. The magazine said that the rush to establish coal-oil works resembled “a mania,” and attributed it to the “impetuous energy” of the American people.In the mid-1850s, whale-oil dealer Samuel Downer Jr. bought the near-bankrupt United States Chemical manufacturing company of Waltham, Massachusetts. The firm manufactured lubricating oil from coal, but the oil sold poorly because of its strong odor."
 1850s – the coal oil era ," The coal oil ""mania"" ","With Downer's financial backing, the firm perfected its lubricant. After a company chemist returned from a visit to the Scottish oil shale region, the firm switched emphasis to lamp oil, which it manufactured at Waltham, as well as at another factory it built at Portland, Maine. Both works used albertite imported from New Brunswick. By the end of 1858, the Downer Company had 50 retorts, and dominated the coal oil business in the northeast.The first American shale oil/coal oil manufacturer using non-imported coal was the Breckinridge Cannel Coal Company, chartered by the Kentucky legislature in 1854."
 1850s – the coal oil era ," The coal oil ""mania"" ","In 1856 its twelve new retorts at Cloverport, Kentucky began producing 600 to 700 US gallons per day (2.3 to 2.6 m3/d) of lamp oil each day. The company had the advantages of proximity to large deposits of cannel coal from the Breckinridge coal deposit in Hancock County, Kentucky, and a location on the Ohio River, providing cheap shipping to markets."
 1850s – the coal oil era ," The coal oil ""mania"" ","Commercial-scale shale oil extraction, other than cannel coal processing, began at shale oil retorts using the Devonian oil shale along the Ohio River Valley in 1857.Shale oil manufacturers followed two geographic patterns: place the retorts close the customers, or close to the oil shale. The first pattern was to place the retorts in or near a major market along the East Coast, and use shale or coal shipped long distances, usually imported from New Brunswick or Scotland. Shale oil manufacturers established themselves along the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic coast from Portland, Maine, to Baltimore."
 1850s – the coal oil era ," The coal oil ""mania"" ","New York had at least fourteen shale oil companies, and Boston seven.The second pattern was to locate the retorts close to the oil shale, and ship only the product long distances. The oil shale industry of the Ohio River Valley followed this model. At least 25 shale oil manufacturers set up retorts along the Ohio River and its navigable tributaries from Pittsburg on the east to St. Louis (on the Mississippi River) on the west. Major coal-oil centers were Pittsburg, with four coal-oil companies; Cincinnati, with three; and Kanawha, Virginia (now West Virginia), with six companies."
 1850s – the coal oil era ," The coal oil ""mania"" ","Kentucky had six coal-oil manufacturers.By early 1860, there were between 60 and 75 shale oil companies in the United States, producing from seven to nine million gallons annually of lamp and lubricating oil. Lamp oil from shale was reportedly much improved, and free from its early problems of smoke and odor. It was hailed as giving “more and cheaper light than any other substance,” and was driving the turpentine-based (camphene) lamp oils, as well as the much more expensive whale oil, from the market."
 1850s – the coal oil era , The coal oil industry is ruined by cheap petroleum ,"Today, oil shale is an “unconventional” energy source, and drilling for crude oil is the norm. But in the late 1850s, those positions were reversed. By 1859, when some venture capitalists hired Edwin Drake to drill for oil in western Pennsylvania, the oil shale industry was well established, and it was the idea of drilling for crude oil that was unproven."
 1850s – the coal oil era , The coal oil industry is ruined by cheap petroleum ,"Petroleum distillation had been going on in the US at a small scale since 1851, when Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania salt manufacturer Samuel Kier began taking the petroleum which was fouling his salt wells, and distilling it in a five-gallon still into lamp oil which he sold to coal miners. Kier never patented his distillation process, and production was limited by the small supply of petroleum that seeped into his salt wells. On 28 August 1859, Edwin Drake discovered oil in a well 70 feet deep along Oil Creek, south of Titusville, Pennsylvania."
 1850s – the coal oil era , The coal oil industry is ruined by cheap petroleum ,"The well made only 12 to 20 barrels per day, but the discovery set off a boom in oil drilling up and down Oil Creek, and then all down the Ohio valley, to Ohio, Kentucky, and Virginia, the same area where many shale oil retorts were located. In 1861, petroleum flooding onto the market drove the price down to US$0.52 per barrel, and lamp oil refiners switched over to petroleum as a much cheaper raw material. Refining petroleum had the further advantage that the process was not patented, allowing refiners to produce lamp oil without paying royalties."
 1850s – the coal oil era , The coal oil industry is ruined by cheap petroleum ,"The existing shale oil refineries were forced by price-cutting competition to adapt their operations to use petroleum instead, and the American oil shale industry, booming just the previous year was suddenly abandoned. Cheap petroleum prices had driven oil shale out of business. World War I put a strain on US and world oil supplies, but even after the war, petroleum consumption kept its rapid rise, as Americans bought record numbers of automobiles."
 1850s – the coal oil era , The coal oil industry is ruined by cheap petroleum ,"Despite steadily growing domestic petroleum production, the American oil industry could not supply the rapidly growing demand, especially for gasoline, and the country had to import increasing amounts of oil, raising prices, and causing widespread speculation that petroleum would be soon exhausted. America was quickly running out of petroleum and into a permanent state of energy scarcity – or at least many experts said so. ""... the peak of production will soon be passed, possibly within 3 years. ..."
 1850s – the coal oil era , The coal oil industry is ruined by cheap petroleum ,"There are many well-informed geologists and engineers who believe that the peak in the production of natural petroleum in this country will be reached by 1921 and who present impressive evidence that it may come even before 1920."" - David White, chief geologist, United States Geological Survey (1919)“The average middle-aged man of today will live to see the virtual exhaustion of the world’s supply of oil from wells,” - Victor C."
 1850s – the coal oil era , The coal oil industry is ruined by cheap petroleum ,"Anderson, president of the Colorado School of Mines (1921)The average price of crude oil in the United States more than tripled, going from $0.64 per barrel in 1915 to US$2.01 in 1920. Domestic oil production grew, but lagged farther behind consumption, and net imports of crude oil to the US rose sharply, from 18 million barrels in 1915 to 106 million barrels in 1920.The nation's largest oil shale resource, Green River Formation, was accidentally discovered in 1874."
 1850s – the coal oil era , The coal oil industry is ruined by cheap petroleum ,"That beds of the Green River Formation could yield oil upon heating had been known for years, but the publication in 1914 of US Geological Survey Bulletin 581, ""Oil-Shale in Northwestern Colorado and Northeastern Utah"" brought the enormous size of the resource to public attention.Concerned that a coming oil famine could strand the American fleet, in 1912 President Taft created the first three Naval Oil Reserves, large federal tracts thought to have oil deposits (two in California and one in Wyoming), which would not be tapped unless the Navy could no longer buy oil from other sources."
 1850s – the coal oil era , The coal oil industry is ruined by cheap petroleum ,"In view of the expected importance of oil shale in the near future, President Woodrow Wilson in 1916 established two Naval Oil Shale Reserves, large tracts of prime oil shale that were kept from passing into private ownership. Oil Shale Reserve 1 (26,406 acres) was in Garfield County, Colorado, eight miles west of the town of Rifle. Oil Shale Reserve 2 (88,890 acres) was in Carbon and Uintah counties, Utah. Oil Shale Reserve 3 (20,171 acres), in Colorado, was added later."
 World War I and gasoline boom , The first western oil shale boom ,"""the potential industry has suffered much harm by the fake promoter and his fake companies.""Attracted by rising oil prices, and the promise of a permanent shortage of petroleum, oil-shale prospectors swarmed over the Piceance and Uinta basins of Colorado and Utah. Some established oil companies joined the rush, but about 100 new companies formed to mine and process oil shale, and, not incidentally, to sell shares of stock. Many of them built retorts to extract the shale oil. Many of the new companies were legitimate, but the honest ones had to compete with the exaggerated promises of the crooks."
 World War I and gasoline boom , The first western oil shale boom ,"Oil shale processing worldwide had always included a retort to produce oil by heating the shale, and a separate refining process to make marketable products from the oil. But some promoters claimed to be able to draw gasoline and other consumer products directly from the retort. One huckster promised that he could extract gold from the oil shale as a byproduct. The US Bureau of Mines had to go out of its way to assure the public that it could not detect recoverable amounts of gold in any oil shale."
 World War I and gasoline boom , The first western oil shale boom ,"At the start of the boom in 1915, oil and oil shale were still locateable minerals under the General Mining Act of 1872. Any US citizen could stake a placer claim to reserve the mineral rights over 160 acres of oil-shale land. Congress changed the situation when it passed the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, which declared that oil and oil shale were no longer locateable minerals, but instead the rights to mine them had to be leased from the federal government."
 World War I and gasoline boom , The first western oil shale boom ,"In September 1920, of the many oil shale companies being promoted, none were yet in commercial-scale operation, although five were said to be close. Of the five, one plant was near Dragon, Utah, one at Salt Lake, two at Elko, Nevada, one at Denver, and one at Dillon, Montana. The plant at Dillon was mining oil shale of the Phosphoria Formation, Permian in age."
 World War I and gasoline boom , The first western oil shale boom ,"The American Continuous Retort plant in Denver was receiving test lots from western Colorado, and as far away as Texas and Kentucky, largely on the proprietor's claim that he could recover gold and platinum from the shale, along with the oil. First attempt to produce oil from the western deposits was made by mining engineer Robert Catlin. Catlin became intrigued by oil shale, and in 1890 bought a plot of land near Elko Nevada that was underlain by oil shale of the Elko Formation."
 World War I and gasoline boom , The first western oil shale boom ,"When the price of oil started rising in 1915, he dug a mine shaft down into the best yielding shale, built a bank of retorts and a small refinery, and began producing oil. He refined the oil into gasoline and lubricating oil, but the products were said to be of low quality. in 1917 he incorporated Catlin Shale Products Company. Catlin's plant at Elko produced about 12,000 barrels (1,900 m3) of oil from shale before he closed it in 1924. Catlin Shale Products Company was dissolved in 1930."
 World War I and gasoline boom , The first western oil shale boom ,"Of the hundred-odd companies that formed to produce shale oil in the postwar boom, only Carlin's had actually done so on a commercial scale and marketed the product.The first attempts to exploit the Green River Formation deposit was made by establishment of The Oil Shale Mining Company in 1916. In 1917, they erected the first commercial retort at the head of Dry Creek, near De Beque, Colorado. However, also these attempts were unsuccessful and by 1926 the company had lost its property."
 World War I and gasoline boom , The first western oil shale boom ,"In addition, companies like Cities Service, Standard Oil of California, Texaco and Union started their oil shale operations in 1918–1920. In 1915–1920 about 200 companies were established to exploit oil shale and at least 25 shale oil retorting processes reached to the pilot-plant stage. Although most of the attention had shifted to the oil shale of the Green River Formation in Colorado and Utah, a number of companies also tried to develop the eastern Devonian shales, mostly the New Albany Shale in Kentucky and Indiana."
 World War I and gasoline boom , The first western oil shale boom ,"Although the eastern shales had a lower oil yield than the western shales, they had the advantages of better infrastructure, abundant water supply, and proximity to markets. At the beginning of 1923, a retort was reported to be making test runs on local Sunbury Shale in Pike County, Ohio, and another southern Ohio oil shale retort was being planned."
 World War I and gasoline boom , Shale oil industry and cheap petroleum ,"The high price of petroleum encouraged intensified exploration in the US and elsewhere, and eventually resulted in the discovery of large new petroleum deposits. American oil production surged in the early 1920s, particularly in north Texas and the Los Angeles Basin in California, driving down both imports and the price of oil. A barrel of oil in the Midcontinent region lost almost two-thirds of its value, falling from US$3.50 at the start of 1921, to US$1.25 at year-end."
 World War I and gasoline boom , Shale oil industry and cheap petroleum ,"Imported oil peaked at 127 million barrels in 1923, then dropped by more than half, to 62 million in 1925.The drop in oil price, and the increased production from new fields, put a damper on speculation that the US was about to run out of oil. Oil shale could not economically compete with petroleum priced below US$2 per barrel, especially given that the productive shale areas were far from major petroleum markets. Cheap petroleum prices had driven oil shale out of business. Some companies continued to work on better ways to process oil shale."
 World War I and gasoline boom , Shale oil industry and cheap petroleum ,"One of technological achievements before World War II was invention of the N-T-U retort. In 1925, the NTU Company built a test plant at Sherman Cut near Casmalia, California. In 1925–1929, the retort was also tested by the United States Bureau of Mines in their Oil Shale Experiment Station at Anvil Point in Rifle, Colorado.Concern about long-term oil supplies during World War II had prompted Congress in 1944 to pass the Synthetic Liquid Fuels Program with goal to establish a liquid fuel supply from domestic oil shale. It funded oil-shale studies by the US Bureau of Mines."
 World War I and gasoline boom , Shale oil industry and cheap petroleum ,"The Bureau of Mines built a test facility at Anvil Points on Naval Oil Shale Reserve 1, to test methods of mining, crushing, and retorting the Green River oil shales. It started to develop the gas combustion retort process. In 1943 Mobil Oil built a pilot shale oil extraction plant and in 1944 Union built an experimental oil shale retort. In 1945 Texaco started shale oil refining study.In 1951, the United States Department of Defense became interested in oil shale as an alternative resource for producing a jet fuel."
 World War I and gasoline boom , Shale oil industry and cheap petroleum ,"The United States Bureau of Mines continued its research program at Anvil Point until 1956. It opened a demonstration mine which operated at a small scale. From 1949 to 1955 it also tested the gas combustion retort. The program ended in 1956. In 1964 the Avril Point demonstration facility was leased by Colorado School of Mines and was used by Mobil-led consortium (Mobil, Humble, Continental, Amoco, Phillips and Sinclair) for further development of that type of retort. In 1953, Sinclair Oil Corporation developed an in-situ processing method using existing and induced fractures between vertical wells."
 World War I and gasoline boom , Shale oil industry and cheap petroleum ,"In the 1960s, a proposal known as Project Bronco, was suggested for a modified in situ process which involved creation of a rubble chimney (a zone in the rock formation created by breaking the rock into fragments) using a nuclear explosive. This plan was abandoned by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1968. Companies developing experimental in-situ retorting processes also included Equity Oil, ARCO, Shell Oil and the Laramie Energy Technology Center.By the 1940s, companies such as Chevron and Texaco owned substantial oil shale areas. A number of oil companies started researching methods to mining and process the oil shale."
 World War I and gasoline boom , Shale oil industry and cheap petroleum ,"In contrast to the boom of the 1920s, which featured hundreds of small startup companies operating on stock sales, the shale research after World War II was a well-financed, long-term effort by established oil companies. Sinclair Oil began testing an in-situ combustion process for recovering shale oil in the 1950s. Union Oil Company of California built and tested its proprietary Union process with a 1,200 ton-per-day retort at its Parachute Creek property near Grand Valley, Colorado in 1957 and 1958. This technology was tested between 1954 and 1958 at the company-owned tract in the Parachute Creek."
 World War I and gasoline boom , Shale oil industry and cheap petroleum ,"This production was finally shut down in 1961 due to cost. In 1957 Texaco built a shale oil extraction pilot plant to develop its own hydroretorting process. In the early 1960s TOSCO (The Oil Shale Corporation) opened an underground mine and built an experimental plant near Parachute, Colorado. It was closed in 1972 because the price of production exceeded the cost of imported crude oil. The federal government offered for lease three large blocks of oil shale land in Colorado in 1968, but rejected all the received bids as insufficient. America faced a shortage of oil."
 World War I and gasoline boom , Shale oil industry and cheap petroleum ,"A confluence of factors combined to create what was called the energy crisis of the 1970s. American crude oil production declined after peaking in 1970, and the country had to import increasing amounts of petroleum. US natural gas production declined after peaking in 1971. A booming world economy turned the buyer's market for oil in the late 1960s into a seller's market in the early 1970s. OPEC took advantage of the tight market to pressure oil companies to pay higher prices. In 1973, some Arab countries stopped shipping oil to nations supporting Israel, including the United States."
 World War I and gasoline boom , Shale oil industry and cheap petroleum ,"The abrupt changes in oil price and supply occurred at a time when federal price controls made it difficult for the American economy to adapt to new market conditions. Allocations of scarce gasoline was controlled by the federal ""Energy czar."" Gasoline stations ran out of product, and drivers waited in block-long lines to fill their tanks.America was quickly running out of oil and into a permanent state of energy scarcity, or at least many experts said so."
 World War I and gasoline boom , Shale oil industry and cheap petroleum ,"Geologist King Hubbert had successfully predicted the approximate year of the peak in US production, and his model predicted a continued and steepening decline in US oil production. The highly influential 1972 Club of Rome report Limits to Growth predicted that the world was entering an era of increasingly scarce mineral resources.The federal government responded with numerous initiatives, one of which was to encourage domestic oil shale production by leasing large tracts of oil shale land in Colorado and Utah."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , The new oil shale boom ,"The United States Navy and the Office of Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves started evaluations of oil shale's suitability for military fuels, such as jet fuels, marine fuels and a heavy fuel oil. Shale-oil based JP-4 jet fuel was produced until the early 1990s, when it was replaced with kerosene-based JP-8. Seventeen companies led by Standard Oil of Ohio formed the Paraho Development Corporation to develop the Paraho process. Production started in 1974 but was closed in 1978."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , The new oil shale boom ,"In 1974 the United States Department of the Interior announced an oil shale leasing program in the oil shale regions of Colorado and Utah. In 1980 the Synthetic Fuels Corporation was established which operated until 1985.In 1972, the first modified in situ oil shale experiment in the United States was conducted by Occidental Petroleum at Logan Wash, Colorado. Rio Blanco Oil Shale Company, a partnership between Gulf Oil and Standard Oil of Indiana, originally considered using Lurgi–Ruhrgas above-ground retort but in 1977 switch also to the modified in-situ process. In 1985 the company ceased its operations."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , The new oil shale boom ,"The White River Shale Corporation, a partnership of Sun Oil, Phillips and Sohio, existed between 1974 and 1986 for developing the tract in the Uintah Basin on the White River area.In 1977, Superior Oil Company cancelled its Meeker shale oil plant project. Year later Ashland, Cleveland Cliffs Company and Sohio exited the Colony Shale Oil Project near Parachute, Colorado. Also, Shell exited the Colony project but continued with in-situ test.In 1970, the Bureau of Mines estimated that shale oil would cost US$2.71 per barrel before profit and taxes."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , The new oil shale boom ,"TOSCO (standing for The Oil Shale Corporation) developed its own retorting process, and in 1963 formed the Colony Development Co. to build and test a 1,000-ton per day processing plant on Parachute Creek, on a 22-square mile tract of oil shale. Colony Development was a consortium of TOSCO, Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co., and Standard Oil of Ohio (SOHIO). The Colony plant began construction in 1965.Engineering Development, Inc. leased the Naval Oil Shale Reserve 1 at Anvil Points in 1972, and formed the Paraho Development Corporation in 1973 as a consortium of 17 energy companies, among them Chevron and Texaco."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , The new oil shale boom ,"The company based its plans on its proprietary Paraho process retorting technology, which achieved oil recoveries of greater than 90 percent. Besides the Anvil Points lease, Paraho leased some oil shale acreage in Utah, but did no work on the Utah properties. The company produced more than 100,000 barrels of shale oil at Anvil Points in the late 1970s.Sunoco and Phillips Petroleum jointly submitted the US$76 million winning bid on the 5,120-acre Federal Tract U-a in Utah, and formed the White River Shale Oil Corporation to run the project."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , The new oil shale boom ,"SOHIO bought into the White River Corporation, and in 1975 the partners won the lease on the adjacent 5,120-acre U-b tract with a US$45 million bid. The company planned to produce 100,000 barrels of shale oil per day by underground mining and surface retorts, but both leases were suspended from 1976 and 1980 because of environmental and land title issue, stopping all development.Gulf Oil and Chevron Corporation formed the Rio Blanco Oil Shale Company in 1974 as a 50:50 partnership to enter the oil shale business."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , The new oil shale boom ,"That same year Rio Blanco won a lease on the first BLM tract put up for competitive bidding, with a winning bid of US$210.3 million. Tract C-a covered 5,100 acres, about eight square miles. Rio Blanco had planned to mine oil shale from an open pit, but wanted the BLM to make additional land available for off-site disposal of the overburden, which the BLM declined. The company turned to in situ mining. Underground combustion was started in 1980."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , The new oil shale boom ,"Two more burns were started in 1981, and the company recovered about 25,000 barrels of oil until a water pump failed, and groundwater prematurely extinguished all three underground burns in 1984.in 1976, a consortium of TOSCO, Shell Oil, Atlantic Richfield Company, and Ashland Oil, leased from the federal government 5,000-acre Tract C-b, located between Rifle, Meeker, and Rangely. The company put down a mine shaft 2,000 feet, from which they planned to drive a network of tunnels horizontally, and mine by conventional room-and-pillar. ARCO and TOSCO withdrew from the Tract C-b joint venture, leaving Shell and Ashland."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , The new oil shale boom ,"In 1977, Shell sold its part to Occidental, and Ashland later sold out what was then known as the Cathedral Bluffs project to Tenneco. Occidental Petroleum Corporation had been began producing shale oil with in situ methods at its test tract near Debeque, Colorado. Pleased with the test-scale results, Oxy scrapped plans for conventional mining at Cathedral Bluffs in favor of its in situ process, in which they would drive a network of tunnels out from the mine shaft, break the oil shale with explosives, and produce oil underground by controlled combustion."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , The new oil shale boom ,"The shale oil would then be pumped to the surface. The calculated recovery was 1.2 billion barrels over the project life.Chevron and Conoco joined in 1981 to start the Clear Creek Project, north of Debeque. The plan was to produce shale oil by underground mining and surface retorting. The partners pilot-tested retort designs at the Chevron refinery outside Salt Lake City.Already-large oil companies entering the oil shale business found their potential reserves increased enormously. Union Oil's shale property promised to increase that company's oil production by 50% overnight, and maintain production at that level for 40 years."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , The new oil shale boom ,"But as the projects developed, the companies found themselves with multibillion-dollar bets on the economic viability of oil shale, and some looked for partners to spread the risk; some sold out entirely. The Colony Oil Shale Project changed hands a number of times, until the only original owner left was TOSCO with 40%. The rest was owned by Exxon. The partners planned a US$5 billion project to mine and process oil shale."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , Black Sunday and the demise of the American shale oil industry 1982-1991 ,"Once again, oil shale fell victim to lower petroleum prices. The oil price began to slump in 1981, and starting in late 1981, one by one, the oil shale players folded on their billion-dollar bets, took their losses, and halted efforts at commercial production. In December 1981, Occidental Petroleum and Tenneco announced that they were suspending work on the Cathedral Bluffs project, and laying off hundreds of employees. The company cited rising construction costs and slumping oil prices as the reasons."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , Black Sunday and the demise of the American shale oil industry 1982-1991 ,"With financial aid from the government Synthetic Fuels Corporation in 1983, the Cathedral Bluffs company revised its plan, and applied for a contract with Synthetic Fuels Corporation to sell it 14,100 barrels of shale oil per day, produced by room-and-pillar mining and surface retorting. But negotiations dragged on, and the Synthetic Fuels Corporation was defunded by the Reagan administration in 1985. Pumping and maintenance of the shaft were suspended in 1991, and the shaft house was demolished in 2002."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , Black Sunday and the demise of the American shale oil industry 1982-1991 ,"The project had not produced any oil.The date usually cited as the end of the oil shale boom is Sunday, 2 May 1982, known locally as “Black Sunday,” when Exxon announced that it was closing its Colony Oil Shale Project and laying off more than 2,200 workers. The project, with a final price tag of US$5 billion, had cost its owners more than $1 billion by the time they quit. No commercial shale oil had been produced.All the towns in the vicinity suffered economically."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , Black Sunday and the demise of the American shale oil industry 1982-1991 ,"The community of Battlement Mesa, built to house the now laid-off employees of the Colony oil shale project, became an instant ghost town. But the community was rescued from disappearance when its properties were marketed as retirement homes on Colorado's sunny western slope, and at a bargain price. Enough retirees took advantage of the oil shale bust to turn the town around in just a few years.Of the attempts to open commercial-scale oil shale operations, only the Union Oil project continued. Union Oil persevered to the extent of spending $1.2 billion, and shipped its first barrel of oil in 1986."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , Black Sunday and the demise of the American shale oil industry 1982-1991 ,"The plant was making 5,000 to 7,000 barrels per day at peak production, helped by a federal subsidy. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 which among other things abolished the United States' Synthetic Liquid Fuels Program."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , Black Sunday and the demise of the American shale oil industry 1982-1991 ,"Union finally bowed to continued low oil prices and closed the project in 1991, rather than complete the US$2 billion project.Over several decades, some of the world's largest oil companies (Amoco, Arco, Chevron, Exxon, Gulf, Phillips, Shell, Sohio, Sunoco, Texaco, Union Oil) had spent billions of dollars to start an oil shale industry in the Green River Formation, the world's largest oil shale resource. But in the end, cheap petroleum prices drove oil shale out of business. Even after the oil shale bust, some companies persevered."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , Black Sunday and the demise of the American shale oil industry 1982-1991 ,"Shell Oil continued testing in situ methods, and in 1997 started a field test of the Shell in situ conversion process. In 2016 Shell successfully tested its in situ process in Jordan, and later spun the technology out to create Salamander Solutions. An oil shale development program was initiated in 2003. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 directed the Department of Energy and the Department of the Interior to begin a program of leasing federal land for commercial oil shale production."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , Black Sunday and the demise of the American shale oil industry 1982-1991 ,"The BLM had already proposed a phased approach, which would allow companies to do research and development, followed by a demonstration project on a lease tract of 160 acres, before expanding into commercial-scale production on a tract up to 4,960 acres adjacent to the initial 160 acres, for a total leased area of 5,120 acres or 8 square miles.In 2005 the government solicited nominations to lease federal land for oil shale research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) projects, and in 2006 and 2007 issued six leases: five in Colorado and one in Utah."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , Black Sunday and the demise of the American shale oil industry 1982-1991 ,"All the leases in Colorado were to test in situ processes; the Utah lease was to test underground shale mining with surface retorts. Shell Oil won three of the leases, to test three different methods, all in Rio Blanco County, Colorado; two of the projects would also recover the sodium mineral nahcolite. Chevron and EGL Resources each won a lease in Rio Blanco County. The Vernal County, Utah lease was won by Enefit American Oil."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , Black Sunday and the demise of the American shale oil industry 1982-1991 ,"In 2008, the BLM finished a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) for the RD&D projects.In 2010, the BLM selected for further consideration three applications for RD&D leases: two in Rio Blanco County, Colorado, and one in Vernal and Uintah counties, Utah. The Colorado lease bids were from ExxonMobil and Aura Source; the Utah bid was from Natural Soda Holdings."
 1970s -  the energy crisis , Black Sunday and the demise of the American shale oil industry 1982-1991 ,"No leases were awarded, and they are pending results of a new programmatic environmental impact statement ordered by the Obama administration.In 2011, the Obama administration halted further nominations for oil shale leasing until the PEIS is finished, and to allow a government review to assure that the lease terms are not economically skewed in favor of the oil companies. As of January 2015, the new PEIS has not been issued.Chevron closed its Chevron CRUSH project in 2012 and Shell closed its Mahogany Research Project in 2013. Andrews, Anthony (2006-04-13).

 Incident ,,"On February 2, 2014 a drainage pipe burst at a coal ash containment pond owned by Duke Energy in Eden, North Carolina, sending 39,000 tons of coal ash into the Dan River. In addition to the coal ash, 27 million gallons of wastewater from the plant was released into the river. The broken pipe was left unsealed for almost a week before the draining coal ash was stopped. The ash was deposited up to 70 miles (110 km) from the site of the spill and contained harmful metals and chemicals."
 Incident ,,"This catastrophe occurred at the site of the Dan River Steam Station, a retired coal power plant which had ceased operation in 2012. Duke Energy apologized for the incident and announced detailed plans for removal of coal ash at the Dan River site. Workers were only able to remove about ten percent of the coal ash that was spilled into the river, but cleanup is ongoing and Duke Energy plans to spend around 3 million dollars to continue the cleanup efforts.CNN reported that the river was turned into an oily sludge."
 Incident ,,"The river is a drinking water source for communities in North Carolina and Virginia. Immediate tests showed increased amounts of arsenic and selenium, but the river was deemed by state officials to be a safe source for drinking water. However, further tests showed the ash to contain pollutants including but not limited to arsenic, copper, selenium, iron, zinc and lead. The coal ash immediately endangered animals and fish species that lived in or around the river. Six days after the spill Duke Energy announced that the leakage had been stopped and they pledged to clean up the coal ash."
 Incident ,,The cause of the ash spill was described by EPA as a limited structural flaw. A storm pipe nearby the deposits of a coal ash slurry containment area broke and allowed for the leakage. Coal ash slurry is produced during the process of burning coal. It is the left over impurities that stick around after burning coal for electricity. Coal companies have found that the cheapest way to store this waste is to mix it with water and store it in a pond.
 Incident ,,"These ponds have been found to have leaks that can dispose hazardous material into surface water among other things. EPA has identified at least 25 coal ash ponds in the southeast that are ""high hazard"". This material was released into the Dan River because of the collapse of a 48 inch drain pipe. The pipe was made of concrete and corrugated metal and reason for the fracture cannot be identified. What resulted was 39 thousand tons of coal ash and 27 million gallons of ash pond water were deposited into the Dan River."
 Incident ,,"EPA has been collecting dissolved contaminant concentration data in the Dan River (from the VA/NC state line to midway between Danville and South Boston) since the coal ash spill. The organization has been periodically comparing the retrieved water/sediment chemistry data to ecological risk screening levels (ERSLs) to assess risk to aquatic and plant life. Coal ash is made up of various materials after the burning of coal takes place. These include silica, arsenic, boron, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, selenium, and zinc. Certain contaminants that were measured exceed the screening levels, necessitating that the water/sediment chemistry must continue to be monitored."
 Incident ,,"Coal ash can coat and degrade the habitats of aquatic animals as well as cause direct harm to certain organisms. The latest surface water sampling results were released by EPA in July 2014. All surface water chemical concentrations were found to be below the ERSLs except for lead. The latest sediment sampling results were also released in July 2014. All sediment chemical concentrations were found to be below the ERSLs except for aluminum, arsenic, barium, and iron. The latest soil sampling results were released in June 2014."
 Incident ,,"All soil chemical concentrations were found to be below the ERSLs except for aluminum, barium, iron, and manganese.The coal ash will never be fully removed from the river. This is due to samples passing human health screening, the potential for historical contamination to become re-suspended, and removal being more detrimental to certain endangered species than the coal ash itself. In addition, the coal ash is already mixed in with existing sediment, complicating its removal further. EPA estimated that about 72 percent of all the toxic water in the country comes directly from coal-fired power plants."
 Incident ,,"The New York Times reported that the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ; formerly the Department of Environment and Natural Resources) was directed to minimize its regulatory role prior to the accident by Governor Pat McCrory. Prior to being Governor, McCrory had worked for Duke Energy for nearly three decades. At the time, it was the third largest coal ash spill to have occurred in the United States."
 Incident ,,"Prior to the incident, environmental groups had attempted to sue Duke Energy three times in 2013 under the Clean Water Act to force the company to fix leaks in its coal ash dumps. Each time, the groups were blocked by NCDEQ, which eventually fined the company $99,111. Federal prosecutors found this fine to be suspiciously low, and investigated both Duke Energy and the state regulators."
 Incident ,,"Many newspaper editorials alleged that Duke Energy's environmental safety controls were lax and that the company ""bullied"" regulators.After the incident, Duke Energy was prosecuted by a number of agencies, and substantial evidence was presented indicating that company officials knew about numerous coal ash leaks in various plants including the Eden facility and declined to resolve it or provide local plant administrators the funds they were requesting to monitor and mitigate the problems."
 Incident ,,"At the federal level, Duke was prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division and pled guilty to nine charges of criminal negligence under the Clean Water Act. Duke agreed to pay $102 million in fines and restitution, the largest federal criminal fine in North Carolina history. Duke also agreed to pay fines to North Carolina and Virginia ($2.5 million)."
 Incident ,,"Largely as a result of the attention brought to Duke Energy's handling of coal ash ponds by the 2014 disaster, the North Carolina state legislature ordered Duke Energy to close its 32 ash ponds in the state by 2029. On May 2, 2014, Duke Energy and EPA agreed to a 3 million dollar cleanup agreement. Part of the agreement is having Duke Energy identify areas of necessary cleanup on the Dan River that is estimated to cost around 1 million dollars."
 Incident ,,The other 2 million dollars is allocated to EPA to address future response methods needed in order to clean up the Dan River. A spokesperson for Duke Energy announced that the company plans to exit the coal ash business. Associates have said that well before the Dan River incident the company had allocated 130 million dollars to transitioning plants to handle fly ash in dry form and manage it in lined landfills.
 Incident ,,"Duke Energy said that it created an advisory group of researchers to help with cleaner coal combustion at its facilities.In February 2016 EPA proposed a $6.8 million settlement, which Duke Energy immediately appealed. In September the corporation accepted a settlement just shy of the original amount at $5,983,750, to be paid for fines, restitution, cleanup assessment, removal, and community action initiatives."
 Incident ,,"Regarding the initial settlement, EPA sends periodic bills to Duke Energy accounting for direct and indirect costs incurred by EPA, its contractors, and the Department of Justice.The states affected launched a lawsuit on July 18, 2019, asking that the court declare Duke Energy responsible for the damage done to the environment by the spill."
 Incident ,,"To keep the energy provider accountable, under the Administrative Settlement Agreement & Order on Consent for Removal Action (AOC) as of May 2014, the Respondent, Duke Energy, was required to submit a number of plans to EPA, including a scope of work, public health, post-removal site control, and engineering plans. The work plan includes descriptions and a schedule of actions required by the settlement. The public health plan ensures protection of public health during on-site removal projects. The post-removal site control plan provides EPA with documentation of all post-removal arrangements."
 Incident ,,"The engineering report describes steps executed by Duke to improve the structural durability of post-release impoundments and storm sewer lines running under their coal ash impoundments.Within these plans, Duke Energy is responsible for creating and implementing a Site Assessment that includes but is not limited to ecological analysis, surface water and sediment assessment as well as post-removal monitoring protocols to calculate the extent of pollution in the Dan River in North Carolina and the Kerr Reservoir and Schoolfield Dam in Danville, Virginia."
 Incident ,,"These assessments were approved by the EPA in consultation with the affected state agencies including NCDEQ and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ). Following the spill and written into the AOC are monitoring protocols in which EPA will sporadically authorize the NCDEQ and VDEQ to take split or duplicate water samples to ensure consistent quality after removal of the coal ash.As of April 1, 2019 North Carolina has ordered Duke Energy to dig up millions of tons of coal ash at six of its power plants."
 Incident ,,"The dangerous coal ash has been mixed with water and stored in uncovered, unlined ponds for decades, but following the 2014 Dan River coal ash spill, many lawsuits have been filed. If the plaintiffs in these cases are successful, Duke Energy would be required to drain all of its 31 ponds. The draining process would cost $5 billion to the already $5.6 billion cleanup from 2014. With the added costs, Duke energy customers could expect to pay a higher fee in the next coming years. 2018 Cape Fear River coal ash spill"
 Timeline of events , Tricia Krause and Tim Janecyk reached out to the Tribune ,"In April 2009, Tim Janecyk and Tricia Krause reached out to the local newspapers. Tim initiated the tip to her and told her it was Crestwood officials who poisoned her family. She achieved all information regarding the contaminated water from her lengthy investigation. She had done research since 1999 seeking to find answers as to why her children were plagued with life-threatening health issues for now more than 30 years. She had given a journalist several large boxes of documentation of her detailed research about Crestwood."
 Timeline of events , Tricia Krause and Tim Janecyk reached out to the Tribune ,"Tricia Krause's records showed that in 1986, after the Illinois EPA had told them that Municipal Well #1 was contaminated, Crestwood officials had promised to start drawing all of their water from Lake Michigan, and to use the contaminated well only in emergencies. Instead, the well remained in use until December 2007. In 2007 the well was tested by the Illinois EPA for the first time in 20 years. The EPA also learned at that time that the well was still in regular use."
 Timeline of events , Tricia Krause and Tim Janecyk reached out to the Tribune ,"Residents were not notified of the contamination by the Illinois EPA, the Illinois Department of Public Health or by the village.Although the Illinois EPA claimed that they discovered the ""illegal and secret"" use of the well in late 2007, they never notified the residents of Crestwood that they had been drinking contaminated well water for more than twenty years."

 Timeline of events , Additional health concerns ,"As of 2006 the Cal Sag Channel was used as a conduit for wastewater from southern Cook County, including the Chicago-area Deep Tunnel Project, into the Illinois Waterway. The Cal Sag Channel was originally engineered as ""essentially an open sewage pipe to convey human and animal waste downstream."" Due to concern over disposing of contaminated sediments, no dredging activities have occurred since 1972."
 Timeline of events , Additional health concerns ,"Today, 90 percent of the Cal Sag Channel's flow originates as run off and municipal or industrial effluent, cooling and process water and storm water overflows.The Cal Sag Channel is a part of the highly polluted Calumet River system. Today, sediments on the river bottom are ""among the most contaminated and toxic that have ever been reported."" Only sludge worms inhabit the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal, indicating that severe pollution exists. The Grand Calumet suffers from contamination from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals, such as mercury, cadmium, chromium and lead."
 Timeline of events , Additional health concerns ,"Additional problems include high fecal coliform bacteria levels, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids, oil and grease. These contaminants originate from both point and nonpoint sources. The amount of these contaminants that entered the public water supply via Municipal Well #1 are unknown."
 Timeline of events , Additional health concerns ,"When Chester Stranczek started rebating property taxes to every homeowner during the mid-1990s, the action was so unusual the National Enquirer declared Crestwood the ""best-run town in America.""""America's best small town mayor, Chester Stranczek, mayor of Crestwood, Illinois, is calling it quits after 50 years of public service."" wrote Kristen Schorsch - Daily Southtown Staff writer in an article published on August 1, 2007.""If you want to define success, you can define in two words, Chester Stranczek."" Schorsch elaborated in the 2007 story."

Next to a portrait of Stranczek, it states: ""… we can save you a lot of time by saying that Crestwood water has passed all the tests prescribed by the EPA during the past year. The results were very favorable, and we have safe drinking water.""In an interview with National Public Radio on October 17, 2007, producer Sam Hudzik said: Stranczek's most proud of his more practical work as mayor. He runs the village just like the two businesses he founded."
 Timeline of events , Additional health concerns ,"That mentality has led to a reputation as a stern administrator who leads Crestwood and the members of its elected board like a monarch. With few exceptions, projects he likes get approved. And nothing else stands a chance. Hudzik interviewed Chester Stranczek in 2007 after he announced his retirement. Hudzik asked the people in the establishment what they thought of the soon to retire mayor."

" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Whistleblowers ,"It was the work of two private citizens who became ""whistleblowers"" that brought the scandal to the attention of the public."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Whistleblowers ,"Chicago WLS TV Channel 7's Paul Miencke reported on May 4, 2009 that ""the story started with a man, Tim Janecyk, who was angry with police and politics in Crestwood after his wife was arrested for leaving their child in the car while she put money in a Salvation Army kettle in 2007."" Meincke went on to say in that report ""Janecyk joined forces with Tricia Krause, a woman who has spent more than ten years trying to convince others that something in Crestwood caused her children to develop cancer."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Whistleblowers ,"She submitted dozens and dozens of FOIA requests to the IEPA demanding information about possible contributing factors. The IEPA response was ""you'll never get anywhere; just drop it!"". Her children have been plagued with various life-threatening health issues for more than twenty years. In 1999, Crestwood resident, Tricia Krause began trying to find answers as to why her three children were suffering almost constantly from a variety of illnesses ranging from viral meningitis, liver damage, acute pylonethritis, atypical bacteria infections, septic, staph infections, organ failure, whooping cough, neurological problems, compromised immune systems, a brain tumor to leukemia."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Whistleblowers ,"In September 2015; she, in fact, was diagnosed with colon cancer. Her two babysitters were both diagnosed with brain tumors. She eventually found herself in Springfield, Illinois poring over documents at the state's EPA office. She discovered the well water which residents and the state were told was no longer in use was in fact being mixed with Lake Michigan water, sometimes by as much as almost 30 percent. This is the figure they provided to the USEPA federal investigators and IEPA officials. She later learned they used the well every day until the well went dry."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Whistleblowers ,"It was never 20%, or 30%; it was all the time! The local baseball fields were saturated with contaminated toxic water. She researched for more than a decade, held numerous local town meetings, created her own epidemiological map and investigated every possible contributing factor. "" Congressman Bobby Rush wrote about Tricia Krause in a press release ""The government is supposed to protect its people but in this case it appears the Village of Crestwood did the complete opposite,"" Rush said."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Whistleblowers ,"""Tricia Krause is an American hero for being brave enough, strong enough and persistent enough to expose this environmental travesty and get justice for the people of Crestwood.""Janecyk had been looking into rumors that the Village of Crestwood had been mixing contaminated water into the drinking water supply in early 2008. It was a somewhat cryptic posting on an internet website, Topix.com, on July 24, 2008, that affirmed the validity of his suspicions concerning the secret use of the contaminated well."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Whistleblowers ,"The posting read ""Is it just me or does the Crestwood tap water taste like its half city water and half Well water."" The identity of this poster or their intentions has never been made public. Janecyk learned about Tricia Krause's efforts to explain the illnesses of her children, who were all born in Crestwood, when he did a Google search using the words ""Crestwood cancer"", and he contacted her to begin many months-long collaboration to expose the use of the well."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Whistleblowers ,"It was Krause's efforts that established proof of the subterfuge when she acquired numerous documents through many Freedom of Information Act requests that showed without a doubt that the village was using the contaminated well to provide drinking water for the residents. Both Janecyk and Krause contacted the Illinois EPA a number of times to point out that the village was secretly using the contaminated well to obtain drinking water for the residents. Ultimately Janecyk became discouraged when the Illinois EPA staffer he had been talking to, Shabu Vazha, claimed that it was legal for Crestwood to use the well."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Whistleblowers ,Tricia Krause had contacted the Illinois Attorney General's office numerous times and was unsuccessful for anyone in their office to reach out to her. She also wrote a letter to Governor Quinn demanding for an investigation to be initiated regarding the use of Crestwood's well. Krause had written a lengthy ten page letter to President Barack Obama informing him of the atrocious situation. For years I had written Senator Dick Durbin mentioning how sick my children had been. I also informed him about how many children were seeking treatment at our local pediatric oncology ward numerous times.
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Whistleblowers ,"We had more than 400 children seeking treatment. I implored him and all state officials to kindly look into what could be a factor. The whistleblowers then turned to the media and tried unsuccessfully for several months to get a local newspaper to publish the story. After that setback Janecyk and Krause then provided environmental reporter Michael Hawthorne of the Chicago Tribune with Tricia's large boxes of documentation and evidence of the village officials wrongdoing. Hawthorne investigated Crestwood's actions and then wrote the article ""Poison in the Well"" which was published on April 19, 2009."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Governor Quinn's response ,"The Chicago Tribune wrote on April 21, 2009 Governor Pat Quinn is demanding answers from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency about why residents of south suburban Crestwood weren't notified that the village had pumped drinking water contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals for more than two decades. Quinn directed his senior staff to conduct a thorough review of the EPA's actions in Crestwood. Among other things, the governor wants to know why the agency didn't invoke a 2005 law requiring the state to issue a notification when residents could be exposed to soil or groundwater pollution."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Governor Quinn's response ,"The Chicago Tribune made the point that ""Quinn championed the right-to-know law while he was lieutenant governor."" As of January 17, 2009, Illinois Governor Quinn has not made this report public."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Governor Quinn's response ,"Quinn said if village officials didn't comply with an order not to use the well ""they're going to suffer serious consequences.""Dan Hynes, a Democrat running against Governor Quinn in the 2010 gubernatorial primary election, said in a statement referring to the Illinois EPA role in the Crestwood water situation ""I am calling on the governor immediately to dismiss Doug Scott (Director of the IL EPA)."" Governor Quinn appeared with Illinois EPA Director Doug Scott at a bill-signing ceremony to enact legislation that would notify residents if their water is contaminated. At the event, Quinn defended the EPA chief."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Governor Quinn's response ,"""Doug's been a good friend of mine, I worked with him as lieutenant governor and governor on this mission...to make sure that we have a healthful environment for every person in Illinois."" Governor Quinn has retained Director Scott to run the Illinois EPA. ""The residents should be notified no matter what. I don't care what the law says, I think its important to go beyond the law so everybody in Crestwood gets a full report about what went on here,"" Governor Quinn said in an interview with WLS-TV."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Governor Quinn's response ,"""Crestwood residents deserve an explanation.""Governor Quinn also wants to make it a felony to make false statements in the annual reports required by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", IDPH Statement of August 13th 2008 ,"Publicly, the Illinois EPA states that they had discovered the use of the contaminated well at the end of 2007.

" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", IDPH Statement of August 13th 2008 ,"Environmental Protection Agency standards, so those using the public water supply are not affected.""

Now agency officials say it won't be officially available until sometime next year (2010), leaving residents guessing if their decades-long exposure to carcinogen-laced tap water contributed to health problems."" ""When the Tribune requested the same data, state health officials said granting the information would violate patient privacy rights."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", IDPH will not release details of cancer study ,"That ruling came despite a 2006 decision by the Illinois Supreme Court that ordered the department to release similar information to another newspaper, the Southern Illinoisan.""The Tribune article further elaborated on the Illinois Department of Public Health ""This isn't the first time the state Public Health Department has withheld information related to Crestwood.

""Businesses don't become successful by running at a loss,"" said Stranczek."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", A political power source ,"Crestwood buys Lake Michigan water from Alsip and its leaders have always boasted of its low water rates. A Daily Southtown story in 2005 about water rates found Crestwood's were the lowest in the Southland at $2 per 1,000 gallons. The average Southland water rate was $3.43 per 1,000 gallons.Low water rates were a source of political power for the Stranczek administrations."

There would not have been any testing for groundwater contaminants over those two decades because the village, when ordered to test Municipal Well #1, in a letter to the IL EPA said ""This sampling would not apply to our facility,' because the town's water came from Lake Michigan and not the well.""After the meeting, the mayor shook hands with a few residents, exited quickly out a back door and was whisked away in a blue SUV."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Tricia Krause's meeting ,"The Chicago Breaking News article also reported on a meeting held later that day by Tricia Krause, an environmental activist and the contaminated water whistleblower at a church in the neighboring village of Palos Heights. More than 600 residents attended the meeting. During that meeting hundreds of people vocalized their anger and sadness about the shocking truth of the water. Many citizens stood up and discussed openly their cancer stories. They also told their story of the death of a loved one who had cancer."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Tricia Krause's meeting ,Tricia Krause had informed them that she requested the Attorney General's office to concrete the well shut. She had confirmed and showed pictures that in fact; it was accomplished. They were told that now they were receiving Lake Michigan water to their homes. It wasn't until finally 2015; Crestwood began to make a serious commitment to rebuild the infrastructure. During the federal trial; Tricia Krause was hired by her attorney to gather information regarding our case. She also worked on the motion summary judgment for several months. This information she acquired was sufficient enough to win our first case.
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Tricia Krause's meeting ,The town of Crestwood was using the well 100% until it went dry. She proved they were not using 10% as the village stated.
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Congressman Rush's speech ,"Congressman Bobby Rush, himself a cancer survivor, spoke at the meeting organized by Tricia Krause. ""U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), whose district includes Crestwood, spoke to about 600 people at a church in neighboring Palos Heights. Rush said he sent a letter to United States Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa P. Jackson demanding the federal agency come to Crestwood to hold public meetings, investigate the village and test to ensure the drinking water is safe. At the meeting Congressman Rush said ""Government is supposed to protect its people, It is almost unheard of. It is atrocious. It is shameful."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Congressman Rush's speech ,"It is criminal for government to knowingly and willfully feed its people contaminated water and year after year lie about it. We are going to get to the truth.""Tricia Krause had invited Shawn Collins, an environmental attorney from Naperville to speak at the meeting. He stated, ""These chemicals did not cause every cancer in Crestwood, but if what happened here - this deliberate infiltration of the water system - caused one, it is wrong."" Collins went on to describe the chemicals found in Crestwoods well ""They are industrial solvents used to do the most heavy duty kinds of industrial cleaning."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Congressman Rush's speech ,"They do not belong in the human body.""Congressman Rush also said ""You are not fighting for Crestwood. You are fighting for America,"" The Congressman called US Attorney General Eric Holder from his seat at the meeting and pressed him to open a United States Department of Justice investigation into the actions of the Crestwood officials."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Calls for federal investigation ,"On April 20, 2009, Congressman Rush called for a federal investigation on the Village of Crestwood to determine if civil or criminal charges are warranted against the municipality after learning more than 51 million gallons of toxic water annually was knowingly pumped into citizen's homes for more than 40 years. The action resulted in a raid nine days later in which more than a dozen federal agents raided city facilities and seized documents."

What no one knew was this was not an isolated incident."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Cover-up ,"A resident at the Mayors meeting in Crestwood yelled to Mayor Stranczek ""You covered up the evidence."" referring to the secret use of the contaminated well""This is an intentional poisoning of more than 11,000 people. And they wanted it to die, wanted the story to go bye-bye,"" said Tim Janecyk, Crestwood whistleblower.Chester Stranczek, Crestwoods former mayor has dealt with environmentalists before."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Cover-up ,"He called incinerator opponents ""cockroaches"" and ""junkies"" at public meetings, refused to let them speak, had them arrested when they did and used his police department to harass their families, according to Phil Kadner of the Southtown Star NewspaperThose who disagreed with Chester Stranczek on environmental matters previously commented on the former mayors tactics ""Police parked at the end of our block and watched my children leave the house and followed them outside."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Cover-up ,"It was an atmosphere of intimidation that you would expect to see in Nazi Germany"" one resident told the SouthTown Star.""Mary Schultz was arrested with three others for disorderly conduct by Crestwood police for attempting to speak at a public meeting"" Kadner reported. Schultz added ""And I see a lot of similarities between that incinerator project and the water contamination."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Cover-up ,"It's exactly the same mentality as far as I'm concerned.""Reporters were also kept away from village meetings in Crestwood ""I witnessed some of that myself at the time when our reporters tried to attend a town meeting that Stranczek organized to rally support for the incinerator"" Phil Kadner said ""The mayor refused to let us inside."" Kadner, who is a reporter for the SouthTown Star Newspaper commented ""as we waited in the parking lot, the police chief, with his hand on his holster, said we would have to leave or he would arrest us."""

" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", IAG files suit ,"disappointed"" by Madigans lawsuit.On March 13, 2010, Maura Possley of the SouthTown Star reported that ""an attorney for Robert Stranczek has moved to have him dismissed from Madigan's lawsuit, citing his November 2007 ascension to the post - two months after the well's use was halted."" Possley went on to write that ""before taking the place of his father, who was mayor for 38 years, Robert Stranczek served as a village trustee.""In responding to the Attorney General's lawsuit, Possley reported that ""Scaccia (the village's water director)invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination numerous times in his response to Madigan's lawsuit."""
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Attorney General investigation ,"""The first that we heard about this was Tricia Krause,"" said Attorney General Lisa Madigan."" Madigan was referring to Crestwoods secret use of the contaminated well. Madigan's office is currently investigating the actions of the Village of Crestwood regarding the use of a contaminated well as a source of drinking water. The office is working to determine what the village did, what the village knew, and when the village knew it, as well as which environmental laws were violated. The office is also working to identify the source of the contamination."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Attorney General investigation ,"When she was asked if there would be criminal charges in the Crestwood case the Attorney General replied ""Somebody has to be held responsible.""""A safe water supply is absolutely critical to the health and safety of the people of Illinois,"" added Madigan. ""The bill passed by the General Assembly strengthens the law and will help to keep our drinking water safe.""The Illinois Attorney General's website says: One of the primary responsibilities of the Attorney General's office is safeguarding the public by protecting the environment."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Attorney General investigation ,"Attorney General Madigan plays a significant role in protecting the health and welfare of all Illinois residents and strives to provide a future that will include a safe environment. The Office of the Attorney General handles both civil and criminal litigation of environmental crimes."" US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, who obtained the federal criminal search warrant to raid the village's offices has still not made public any federal criminal charges as of June 12, 2009."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", US EPA actions ,"Special Agent in charge of criminal investigations, Randall Ashe of the United States Environmental Protection Agency stated in front of television news cameras and reporters on the day that the offices of Crestwoods public works were raided that ""this is the first time in history that the United States EPA has obtained a criminal search warrant on another government agency."""
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Special Agent Randall Ashe ,"An article reposted on a website called ""SierraActivist"" (originally written on 2.14.2003 by Richard Boyd of The Times-Picayune newspaper) commented on the EPA Special Agent: ""When Randall Ashe or any of his six agents show up, it is too late for one more chance; it's time to pay the piper for committing serious environmental crimes. Ashe and his agents carry weapons, have arrest power, can obtain search warrants and conduct secret surveillance, and work with federal or state authorities in prosecuting individuals and companies that commit environmental crimes."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Special Agent Randall Ashe ,"""When we show up, it is too late for more compromise, more negotiating, more one-more-chance to do right,"" Ashe said. ""We show up when it is time to make the case, collect the evidence, get the search and arrest warrants, and proceed with criminal prosecutions."" Special Agent Ashe's attitude towards environmental offenders is summed up in a quote from a USEPA news release from 2.5.09 EPA Special Agent in Charge Randall K."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Special Agent Randall Ashe ,"Ashe said, ""People who cheat on environmental laws to save money need to know that we will investigate them and prosecute them to the full extent of the law."""
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Feds Raid Crestwood's engineering firm ,"According to a June 25, 2009, report by Chicago's WGN radio: Federal agents raided the offices of Crestwood's engineering firm, the latest step in a criminal investigation into the Cook County suburb's secret use of a community well contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals. Randy Chastain, president of Burke Engineering, 18330 Distinctive Dr., Orland Park, confirmed that investigators from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency served a search warrant obtained by U.S. Atty. Patrick Fitzgerald's office. The agents left with boxes of engineering diagrams and other records related to the firm's work for Crestwood. ""We're cooperating,"" Chastain said."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Feds Raid Crestwood's engineering firm ,"""We offered them everything we have on record."" The IEPA's recently released report on Crestwood's drinking water did say that harmful chemicals were detected near the suspected source of the well's contamination, a dry-cleaning business located about 300 feet from the well. Not one newspaper or news channel reported information that the engineering company for the village of Crestwood was also involved in the debacle."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Legislation ,"Illinois' Governor Pat Quinn, reacting to public outrage, signed House Bill 4021 into law in August 2009 addressing many of the legal issues that grew out of the contaminated water scandal in Crestwood. WLS TV's Paul Miencke reported on August 23, 2009 Tricia Krause proposed the bill to incur a 50 year sentence of jail time so that there would never be another Crestwood incident. No one heard her voice. Bill 4021 was made to break again. It was now only a felony if someone tampered with the water supply."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Legislation ,"Madigan stated; ""We need to make sure that what happened to Crestwood residents never happens again in Illinois,"" said Madigan. ""The law needed to be strengthened to protect public safety and to restore public trust."" Gov. Pat Quinn signed a bill Sunday that he says will help ensure Illinois citizens have safe, clean drinking water. The bill is designed to prevent future incidents like the water contamination discovered earlier this year in south suburban Crestwood, Ill."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Legislation ,"For years, Crestwood village officials told townspeople that all their water came from Lake Michigan exclusively, when records showed that Crestwood was co-mingling its lake water with water from a village well that had shown levels of a known carcinogen. The governor has signed a law that will require water suppliers to notify all their customers if tests reveal any contamination with their water supply. In Crestwood's case, the EPA had long ago told the village that the well in question had problems, but Crestwood didn't tell residents."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Legislation ,"Under the new law, water suppliers have five days to notify all of their customers of any problems. Commenting on the law just signed by Governor Quinn, Attorney General Lisa Madigan said They certainly weren't telling people who were drinking that water, brushing their teeth with that water, cooking with that water, showering with that water, that the water had contaminants in it. That is simply wrong, and it needs to end."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Changes to ILEPA ,"According to Miencke ""The state EPA, because of the Crestwood issue, is changing one aspect of its water testing. There are more than 1,000 communities in Illinois that deliver water that they first purchase from someone else, another community or supplier. The EPA has always done its water quality testing at the supplier. Now, it will test at the distribution point.""In the July/August 2009 issue of ""Illinois Issues,"" author Bethany Jaeger reports that ""because village officials reported that the well served only as an emergency backup, it wasn't required to be tested."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Changes to ILEPA ,"And the state relies on an honor system for such reporting.""There was no federal requirement. They (village officials)knew what they were doing,"" says Rick Cobb, deputy manager of the state EPA's Division of Public Water Supply. The department (IL EPA)detected vinyl chloride in Crestwood's well in September 2007. Less than two months later, Crestwood maintained that it still did not draw water from the well. The story changed on August 21, 2008, when Frank Scaccia, the former water supply operator, told officials that the village did, indeed, supplement Lake Michigan water with well water."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Water director retains an attorney ,"Frank Scaccia's attorney, Bill Seith of Total Environmental Solutions in Oakbrook Terrace, says his client ""is certainly very interested in making sure that everybody is properly informed."" According to information posted on the firms website, Bill Seith, Scaccia's attorney, was previously the Deputy Director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Seith, in his own words said he has ""more than 10 years (experience working)at Illinois Attorney General's office, Environmental Bureau, where he worked for more than four years as chief. ""As a former Deputy Director of Illinois EPA, William Seith, oversaw that Agency's Office of Community Relations."""
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Blagojevich-Madigan feud ,"The Chicago Tribune's Michael Hawthorne reported in an August 23, 2009, article ""What appeared to be an obvious violation of state environmental laws became entangled in one of former Gov. Rod Blagojevich's political feuds, delaying action for months. Dozens of other cases against polluters languished as well, largely because Blagojevich and his top aides refused to refer them to his archnemesis, Atty. Gen. Lisa Madigan, a Tribune investigation found. Blagojevich and Madigan started out on amicable terms after they were elected in 2002."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Blagojevich-Madigan feud ,"But EPA referrals of civil and criminal violations to the attorney general began to drop sharply in 2005, and fell to a record low of 114 in 2007, according to state records."" Hawthorne identified the feud between the Illinois Governor and the Attorney General as one of the contributing factors in the success of Crestwood's coverup. ""The agency (the IL EPA) hasn't sent a criminal case to the attorney general in two years, records show."" The Tribune reporter noticed a concerning lack of prosecutions against environmental offenders."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Blagojevich-Madigan feud ,"""By contrast, previous administrations on average referred about 300 environmental cases during most years since the mid-1980s."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Blagojevich-Madigan feud ,"The EPA forwarded nearly 30 criminal violations to the attorney general in 2003, before the relationship soured between two of the state's top Democrats."" ""Polluters didn't suddenly wise up and start following the law."" wrote Hawthorne, ""Instead, top EPA officials now acknowledge, the agency avoided sending cases to Madigan, whose office handles most of the legal work for state government."" ""There were some issues between us and the attorney general, and that skewed those numbers,"" said the Illinois EPA Director Doug Scott, who was appointed by Blagojevich in 2005 and kept on by Quinn."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Blagojevich-Madigan feud ,"According to the Rockford Register Star, Scott's hometown newspaper ""Blagojevich and Doug Scott are good friends.""""As the conflict roiled, federal officials stepped in on some of the biggest environmental cases in the Chicago area.""The Tribune reporter pointed out ""For instance, the U.S. EPA is conducting a high-profile criminal investigation into Crestwood's secret use of a community well contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals, a case the Illinois EPA tried to quietly handle informally while Blagojevich was still governor."""
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Installation of monitor ,"State inspectors dug a monitoring well on September 14 in Crestwood to help determine how the suburb's drinking water was contaminated with toxic chemicals. Testing equipment placed underground near Crestwood's former community well, which was dismantled earlier this year, will help determine whether cancer-causing solvents seeped through cracks in bedrock into the village's water supply."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", October 2009: new Illinois EPA test results ,"On October 9, 2009, the Illinois EPA on its website released test results for the groundwater near the well that Crestwood used to obtain drinking water for its residents ""The concentration of vinyl chloride found in the bedrock's groundwater between 39 and 49 feet below ground surface averaged 55.7 parts per billion (ppb), ten times the concentration Illinois EPA found in the PWS well 3 years ago (5.4 ppb). This water contains twenty five times more of the toxic compound vinyl chloride than is allowed in drinking water by law."

Even though Hawthorne and the Chicago Tribune had filed at least two FOIA requests for the details and data from the Illinois Department of Health study he was denied the information by the agency who stated ""patient confidentiality"" in their refusal to divulge the contents of the study."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", December 2009 IDPH refuses to release cancer study ,"The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled in a similar case that the release of such study information does not violate patient confidentiality in any way because the patients cannot be identified by the information personally.

The Tribune did not report information that the engineering company for the village of Crestwood was also involved in the debacle."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", January 2010: Chester Stranczek's attorneys say he is not fit to testify ,"An article in the SouthTown Star newspaper on January 3, 2010 by Maura Possley reported that the attorneys for Chester Stranczek had filed a motion in front of Cook County Circuit Court Judge Mary K. Rochford to argue that the former mayor, who is now eighty years old, is not fit to testify in any of the many civil trials before the court at this time because he suffers from Parkinsons dementia."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", January 2010: Chester Stranczek's attorneys say he is not fit to testify ,"According to the article it is expected that the courts decision in this matter will set a precedent for all of the civil lawsuits and the anticipated criminal charges against Stranczek. During the hearing on January 13, 2010, Chester Stranczeks attorney, Chris Gair from the Chicago firm Jenner & Block, presented as a witness Dr. Cindy Zadikoff, an assistant professor of neurology specializing in movement disorders at NorthWestern Memorial Hospital. According to Maura Possley of the SouthTown Star Newspaper ""Dr. Zadikoff examined Stranczek in August and October."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", January 2010: Chester Stranczek's attorneys say he is not fit to testify ,"The doctor testified that his wife reported that Stranczek, when they returned from their Boca Raton home to their Crestwood house, would forget where the bathroom or bedroom were."" The same article goes on to say that ""Plaintiffs attorney Burton Weinstein ( a partner at the Chicago law firm of Baskin, Server, Berke & Weinstein ) questioned whether Stranczek could exaggerate symptoms or fake his way through her exams to try to indicate he was unfit to testify."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", January 2010: Chester Stranczek's attorneys say he is not fit to testify ,"Weinstein also referred to reports from Stranczek's former doctor of him having less-severe memory loss and said some of Stranczek's medications were known to heighten confusion or memory loss.""

" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Residents respond to IDPH study ,"While he doesn't believe the water ingested by Crestwood residents was the sole cause of these instances of cancer, De John believes it was likely a factor, he said in an interview with a reporter from the SouthTown Star Newspaper."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", Residents respond to IDPH study ,"""Most shocking,"" De John said in the same interview, ""was the data showing much higher rates of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx esophagus in Crestwood than researchers had anticipated."" Researchers found twice as many cases of esophageal cancer as they expected and nearly twice as many cases of oral cavity cancer.Some residents of Crestwood claimed that the federal government was using ""Gestapo"" tactics in the investigation against the current and former mayors Robert and Chester Stranczek."

Bill Gannon, a resident of Crestwood since 1972 told the panel on stage ""What kind of whitewash is this...these aren't facts...these are just part-time facts put in where you feel like putting them in."" Howard Smith, a Manteno resident who worked at ComEd in Crestwood for almost 30 years, asked health officials about possibly including people in the cancer study who didn't live in the village but worked there for decades."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", IDPH open meeting on health assessment ,"Smith himself has kidney disease. Linda Malin, a Crestwood resident with Parkinsons disease said ""I believe (drinking the water for) 15 years has an effect on you.""According to Becky Schlikerman of the SouthTown Star ""Other diseases weren't studied."" She reported that ""officials from the Illinois Department of Health, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency didn't have answers...about kidney disease, gastrointestinal diseases and neurological diseases.""Health officials could not say that the contaminated water from Crestwood's municipal well caused any illness."
" The ""Best-run town in America"" ", IDPH open meeting on health assessment ,They also said that they could not say the water did not cause any of the cancers identified. The officials said that they will continue to monitor the incidence of cancer in the village and that in many cases the cancers caused by contaminated water may take ten to twenty years to develop.
 Outcome ,,"The escaped gas rose into Earth's atmosphere after clearing the surface. An estimated 6 to 8.8 million litres (210,000 to 310,000 cubic feet) of natural gas was released from the damaged pipe per day. The leak was first reported in February 2017. The pipeline operator, Hilcorp Energy, said that there was too much sea ice to safely launch a repair mission."
 Outcome ,,"They added that shutting off the flow of natural gas through the pipeline would compound the problem, because the pipe had previously been used to transport crude oil and the residual crude in the pipe would then be exposed to the sea water once the pipeline was depressurized. The leak was reported to be dry natural gas being sent to the platforms as fuel, which consists of 99% methane. Divers reported that the leak was caused by the pipeline being laid across a rock on the ocean floor, resulting in a small hole."
 Outcome ,,"Non-profit organizations representing the environment have either sued or expressed interest in suing Hilcorp Energy, claiming that the ongoing situation is a danger to beluga whales and other marine life.The leak was repaired April 13, 2017 when divers were able to install a clamp on the leaking pipe. The Alaska-based environmental organization Cook Inlet Keeper has sent a letter to Hilcorp Energy, stating their intent to sue the energy company, for what the group alleges are violations of the Clean Water Act. The Center for Biological Diversity further alleges that Hilcorp Energy is in violation of four federal laws."
 Outcome ,,"In addition to the Clean Water Act, the Center maintains that Hilcorp is violating the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Pipeline Safety Act in a letter to the company announcing the Centers planned litigation against them.In addition, the administration of Alaska Governor Bill Walker, through the cabinet-level Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC), has demanded that Hilcorp Energy closely monitor the environmental impact of the ongoing leak."
 Outcome ,,"ADEC has also requested that Hilcorp hire specialists to look for dead fish and other marine life in the area, and to come up with a repair plan by March 8, 2017."
 Cleanup Progress: Actual Construction Underway ,,"In 1984, the landfill was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL). GAEPD began negotiations with Hercules to perform an RI/FS and initiated Site investigation activities under State Superfund authority, then withdrew as lead agency in 1987 before negotiations were completed. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assumed primary control of the investigation and related activities at the end of 1987. In July 1988, Hercules and EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent for conducting the RI/FS.Under the Site, groundwater flows towards several private drinking water wells."
 Cleanup Progress: Actual Construction Underway ,,"In recognition of this potential threat, in 1991 EPA initiated an interim action (in the form of an operable unit) to connect the affected residences to Brunswick's municipal water supply. All water connections were completed by December 1992. In the summer 1992, EPA discovered relatively low levels of toxaphene in the front yards of the residences adjacent to the Site. The residents were temporarily relocated while their yards were excavated and then backfilled with clean fill."
 Cleanup Progress: Actual Construction Underway ,,"The contaminated soil from the residential area was stockpiled on Hercules' property and later stabilized with the rest of the 009 Landfill.In 1993, EPA enumerated the final remedy for the Site in a Record of Decision (ROD). The areas to be remediated included the sludge contained in the landfill cells, the soils in the sludge-staging area on the Hercules property, and the Benedict Road/Nix Lane area outside the Hercules property. The remedy selected in the ROD includes the stabilization of subsurface soils and consolidated surface soils which the PRP is designing and constructing."
 Cleanup Progress: Actual Construction Underway ,,"In addition, surface water in the adjacent drainage ditch and groundwater under the Site will be monitored for toxaphene. The remedial design for this remedy was finalized in early 1998 and construction activities were completed in March 1999. EPA approved the construction completion report in September 1999. The 2nd Five Year Review was completed in June 2006. Post monitoring results indicate a successful and effective remedy.

 Background ,,"The Clean Water Act (CWA), enacted in 1972 as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, regulates water pollution into ""waters of the United States."" One of its provisions involves the regulation of pollutants from point sources (such as the drainage from an industrial plant) into surface waters."
 Background ,,"Operators of any point source are required to obtain a permit through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) that limits what pollutants may be emitted by the point source, necessary treatment steps to take to limit those pollutants, and other considerations.It is unclear whether the Act covers discharges into waters of the U.S. through groundwater."
 Background ,,"A plain reading of the statute indicates that it does, ""The term ""discharge of a pollutant"" and the term ""discharge of pollutants"" each means (A) any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source, (B) any addition of any pollutant to the waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean from any point source other than a vessel or other floating craft."" Whether the CWA covers fairly traceable discharges through groundwater into navigable waters of the U.S. was the fundamental question of the Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund appeal before the United States Supreme Court."
 Background ,,"The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) directly regulates discharges into groundwater aquifers, such as through injection wells, and additional regulations set by each state. The EPA still regulates the type of wastewater that can be injected through the Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program, but broadly, the UIC Program allows much higher levels of pollutants to be injected compared to the NPDES, due to the natural filtration action that occurs in groundwater aquifers. Of particular interest to the case are Class V UIC wells—wells used to dispose of non-hazardous water waste into underground aquifers."
 Background ,,"Typically these will include stormwater drainage or agricultural runoff. The EPA estimates there are 650,000 such Class V wells in place across the United States. In the present case, the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility in Maui County, Hawaii treats wastewater from homes and businesses. The facility is authorized by the EPA and the Hawaii Department of Health under the SDWA to inject the reclaimed water into four Class V wells on the island, with an average total effluent of 3–5 million US gallons (11–19 million L) per day."
 Background ,,"Because of the geologic nature of Hawaii, it was estimated that more than 90% of this water eventually enters the surrounding ocean through seepage. During the planning and subsequent reviews of the facility, both the EPA and the state had determined that there was no need for the facility to apply for a NPDES permit, since it was not a point source under the CWA."
 Background ,,"However, work done by University of Hawaii at Manoa proved that approximately 60% of the injections of wastewater from the Lahaina facility were reaching nearby ocean waters via groundwater using tracer dye studies to track the destination of the wastewater, and piezometer studies observed heightened levels of nutrients at the site."
 Background ,,"In 2012, several environmental activist groups, including the Hawaii Wildlife Fund, the Surfrider Foundation, the Sierra Club-Maui Group, and the West Maui Preservation Association, represented by Earthjustice, sued the county for lacking appropriate NPDES permits, arguing that their injection wells were truly point sources since past EPA studies using dye tracers had shown it possible to trace the discharge from individual wells into the ocean."
 Background ,,"Reclaimed water, which can possess higher levels of bacteria and other microorganisms, that seeped into the ocean led to the spread of algal blooms near Maui's shores and could impact the health of coral reefs, aquatic and mammalian life, and humans that live near the shore, according to the environmental groups. The County disputed this with support of the EPA, stating that the wells were not a direct point source defined from the CWA."
 Background ,,"The suit was filed after the environmental groups plead with the county on civil grounds to seek an NPDES permit in the years prior.In 2014 the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii found for the plaintiffs, agreeing that the facility needed NPDES permits for the injection wells and for the facility itself. The county appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which also ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in 2018. The Ninth Circuit's decision drew on Rapanos v."
 Background ,,"United States (2006), in which the plurality decision authored by Justice Antonin Scalia suggested that permits would be required even for point source pollutants that ""do not emit 'directly into' covered waters, but pass 'through conveyances' in between."" The court claimed that the plain language of the CWA supported the requirement that the discharge from the wastewater plant be subject to permit, held that the Clean Water Act required a permit when pollutants were ""fairly traceable"" to the original point source. This was a novel test for the CWA, rejecting two standards proposed by the County and the EPA."
 Background ,,"In the specific case of the Maui wastewater plant, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the pollutants from the wells to the ocean that resulted in pollution concentrations above de minimis levels was ""fairly traceable"" and thus would need a permit under the CWA. The Ninth Circuit concluded that ""at bottom, this case is about preventing the county from doing indirectly that which it cannot do directly""."
 Background ,,"The court declined to hear the case en banc.During the early parts of the case, the EPA, under President Barack Obama's administration still had upheld the initial statements that there were no need for permits for these types of wells, but had been working with environmentalists to devise new standards. With the election of Donald Trump in 2016, the EPA took a stronger stance against the environmentalist position, and in April 2019, after the trial court and appellate court decisions, issued a new guidance document asserting that the CWA does not cover such discharges."
 Background ,,"This document is not binding on the Supreme Court.Regardless of the outcome of the case, the County agreed to pay a US$100,000 fee to the groups should they prevail in the challenge, and are working on developing more projects in Maui to use more of the reclaimed water produced by the plant for beneficial uses as to minimize any seeping to the ocean."
 Background ,,"The County filed its petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, arguing that the test proposed by the Ninth Circuit for defining a point source discharge conflicted with the Supreme Court's prior ruling in South Florida Water Management District v. Miccosukee Tribe (2004) and upheld in several subsequent cases. The County also raised concerns that this test would affect a significant portion of the other 650,000 Class V wells in operation, requiring these wells to also obtain NPDES permits. The County also referred to the Supreme Court's decision in Michigan v."
 Background ,,"EPA (2015), which stated the EPA failed to consider the costs necessary in what it considered a ""necessary and appropriate"" rule-making change to enforcement of the Clear Air Act that affected the nation's power plants. The County believed that the new point source test from the Ninth Circuit would be a similar economic burden. The Supreme Court approved the petition in February 2019.Oral arguments before the Supreme Court were held November 6, 2019. The Justices debated with the legal representatives on the impact of a ruling in either direction."
 Background ,,"A ruling that favored the county of Maui could potentially allow wastewater dischargers to simply modify how their wastewater is discharged with minimal cost to avoid EPA's regulations, while a ruling favoring the Wildlife Fund could leave many smaller property owners, including home owners, at fault for unintentional leaks of wastewater from their properties. The Court issued its 6–3 decision on April 23, 2020, which vacated the Ninth Circuit's decision and remanded the case to the lower court."
 Decision , Majority opinion and concurrence ,"Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Brett Kavanaugh. In his opinion, Breyer wrote that the ""fairly traceable"" test that the Ninth Circuit had adopted would give the EPA greater authority on pollutant regulation than Congress had given at the time, as the Ninth Circuit's test could apply to a source of pollution that may have occurred a century before and hundreds of miles away due to the slow motion of groundwater."
 Decision , Majority opinion and concurrence ,"However, the decision also outright rejected the County of Maui's argument that the discharge in the present case did not need a permit, as the language of the CWA as intended by Congress would cover the types of discharge.In the decision, Breyer asserted that a permit for discharge would be required for point sources, or for non-point sources, for ""the functional equivalent of a direct discharge"", which had been demonstrated in the present case."
 Decision , Majority opinion and concurrence ,"Breyer wrote as an example ""Where a pipe ends a few feet from navigable waters and the pipe emits pollutants that travel those few feet through groundwater (or over the beach), the permitting requirement clearly applies."
 Decision , Majority opinion and concurrence ,"If the pipe ends 50 miles from navigable waters and the pipe emits pollutants that travel with groundwater, mix with much other material, and end up in navigable waters only many years later, the permitting requirements likely do not apply."" Breyer's opinion included two major factors to be considered in evaluating whether non-point source discharge was functionally equivalent to direct discharge: the distance that the pollutant must travel from the point of discharge to the federal waterway, and the time that it would take."
 Decision , Majority opinion and concurrence ,"Other factors that can impact this included the ground material that the pollutant traveled through, how the pollutant changed or interacted with other chemicals within the ground, and how much of the pollutant made it to the waterway.In his concurring opinion, Kavanaugh stressed that the majority opinion was consistent with Rapanos."
 Decision , Dissenting opinions ,"Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch. Thomas took the stance that the CWA was more restrictive and only required a permit from a true direct discharge source, and would have reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision in favor of the County of Maui. Justice Samuel Alito also wrote a dissent, more critical of the majority opinion setting a new standard for determining the need for a permit, but would have also reversed the Ninth's decision."
 Decision , Dissenting opinions ,"Breyer instructed the Ninth on remand to consider the ""functional equivalent"" test, in guidance with the EPA, to re-evaluate the discharge from the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility and for similar cases going forward, barring a change in the CWA statute from Congress. This would thus determine if the original case brought by the Hawaii Wildlife Fund could then proceed. The decision is also expected to lead the EPA to develop specific rules related to the ""functional equivalent"" test to be set in place after public review."
 Decision , Dissenting opinions ,"Additionally, several pending cases filed by environmentalists against wastewater plants and oil processing companies related to their water discharge are expected to be re-evaluated in light of the majority decision.The decision was generally seen as a favorable outcome for environmentalists, though the test proposed by Breyer was narrower than what environmentalists had proposed. The decision also rejected the attempt by the Trump administration to remove any type of permit requirements on these sites, as well as rejecting the EPA's attempts to bypass parts of the CWA statute."
 Decision , Dissenting opinions ,"Other industry sectors such as the chemical and energy sectors feared that this will require a review of their waste discharge, which had previously determined the need for permitting under bright-line rule, with new, vague guidelines set by the Supreme Court.In July 2021, following the Supreme Court decision, the Hawaii District Court determined that the Lahaina plant's groundwater injection of sewage was the ""functional equivalent of a direct discharge"" and required the plant to obtain an NPDES permit.

 Synopsis ,,"The story centers on Parkersburg, West Virginia, where the DuPont facility that manufactured Teflon was located and follows the personal stories and tribulations of several people who worked at the facility. The film includes footage of public hearings, news reports and corporate ads, along with input from scientists and activists. The film's title refers to an internal DuPont memorandum of sticking with ""the devil we know"" in the continued use of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), rather than spending funds to develop a safer alternative."
 Synopsis ,,"Teflon was originally created in 1945, and soon found its way into products including stain-resistant carpets, carpet-cleaning liquids, microwave popcorn bags, outdoor furniture, baking pans, and frying pans. 3M originally created the PFOA compound, the key substance in Teflon, before selling it to DuPont. Despite a memorandum from 3M to specifically avoid dumping the substance into water, DuPont ""dumped, poured and released"" at least 1.7 million pounds of PFOA between 1951 and 2003.After DuPont began dumping PFOA into the water, local farmer Wilbur Tennant's cattle began dying off, though he was unaware of the cause."
 Synopsis ,,"Their teeth would turn black, and calves would be born with very specific facial deformities. Ken Wamsley, a Parkersburg resident, says in the film that his neighbors began reporting that their children's teeth were turning black. Sue Bailey, one of two women working at the Parkersburg DuPont facility, gave birth to a son, Bucky, who suffered the same type of facial deformity as that of Tennant's cattle. The other female DuPont worker, not shown but mentioned in the documentary, gave birth to a child with deformities as well."
 Synopsis ,,"Ken Wamsley relates to how at least fifteen of his DuPont work colleagues all died of cancer, specifically testicular, thyroid and rectal cancer - in the years since, studies have shown a correlation between high PFOA exposure and six health outcomes: kidney cancer, testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol), and pregnancy-induced hypertension.Footage of Charles O. Holliday, the CEO of DuPont at the time, Bruce Karrh, DuPont's corporate medical director, and Kathleen Forte, DuPont's public relations officer, is shown where they admit knowingly polluting the local water."
 Synopsis ,,"DuPont had been conducting its own medical studies for more than four decades, which had shown that PFOA caused cancerous testicular, pancreatic and liver tumors in lab animals. The documentary touches on the detection of PFOA in the blood of more than 98% of the general US population in the low and sub-parts per billion (ppb) range, with levels much higher in chemical plant employees and surrounding subpopulations. The only samples clean of PFOA were found in US Army blood samples taken at the beginning of the Korean War in 1950."

 Circumstances , Financial difficulty ,"Atari, Inc. had been purchased by Warner Communications in 1976 for $28 million, and had seen its net worth grow to $2 billion by 1982. By this time, the company accounted for 80% of the video gaming market and was responsible for over half of its parent company's revenues, earning some 65–70% of their operating profits. By the last quarter of 1982, its growth in the following year was expected to be in the region of 50%. However, on December 7, 1982, the company reported that its earnings had only increased by 10–15%, rather than the predicted figure."
 Circumstances , Financial difficulty ,"The next day saw Warner Communications' share prices fall by a third, and the quarter ended with Warner's profits falling by 56%. In addition, Atari's CEO, Ray Kassar, was later investigated for possible insider trading charges as a result of selling some five thousand shares in Warner less than half an hour before reporting Atari's lower-than-expected earnings. Kassar was later cleared of any wrongdoing, although he was forced to resign his position the following July. Atari, Inc. would go on to lose $536 million in 1983, and was sold off by Warner Communications the following year."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"Atari's tendency to port arcade games for its home console had led to some of its most commercially successful games, including the port of its own coin-op Asteroids, as well as the licensed versions of Taito's Space Invaders and Namco's Pac-Man. When the latter game received its official port to the Atari 2600, Atari was confident that sales figures would be high, and manufactured 12 million cartridges—despite having sold only around 10 million Atari 2600 consoles."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"It was believed that the game would be successful enough not only to earn an estimated $500 million, but also to boost sales of the console itself by several million as gamers sought to play the home conversion."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"However, the finished product, released in March 1982, was critically panned for its poor gameplay, and although it became the console's best-selling game after shipping 7 million units, it left Atari with over 5 million unsold cartridges—a problem compounded by the high rate of customers returning the game for refunds.Further to the problems caused by Pac-Man's underwhelming sales, Atari also faced great difficulty as a result of its video game adaptation of the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"The game was a result of a deal between Warner Communications and the film's director Steven Spielberg, and was an attempt to follow the success of Atari's Raiders of the Lost Ark, another film-based game. It was later reported that Warner had paid $20–25 million for the rights, which was at the time a high figure for video game licensing."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"The task of developing the game fell on Howard Scott Warshaw, the programmer for Raiders, but due to lengthy delays in the licensing rights, Warshaw had only five weeks to make a full game to make sure Atari could sell it during the upcoming holiday period. The rushed development resulted in lackluster gameplay; the game was critically panned, and is now seen as one of the worst ever made. Atari manufactured 5 million cartridges for the game; however, upon its release in December 1982, only 1.5 million copies were sold, leaving Atari with half of the cartridges."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"Billboard writer Earl Paige reported that the large number of unsold E.T games, along with an increase in competition, prompted retailers to demand official return programs from video game manufacturers.The failures of these games were further compounded by Atari's business dealings from 1981. Confident in strong sales, the company had told its distributors to place their 1982 orders all at once. However, video game sales in 1982 had slowed, and distributors who had ordered en masse in expectation of high turnover were left to simply return large quantities of unsold stock to Atari."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"As a result, the company soon found itself in possession of several million essentially useless video game cartridges, which it would be entirely unable to sell. In September 1983, the Alamogordo Daily News of Alamogordo, New Mexico reported in a series of articles, that between 10 and 20 semi-trailer truckloads of Atari boxes, cartridges, and systems from an Atari storehouse in El Paso, Texas, were crushed and buried at the landfill within the city. It was Atari's first dealings with the landfill, which was chosen because no scavenging was allowed and its garbage was crushed and buried nightly."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"Atari's stated reason for the burial was that it was changing from Atari 2600 to Atari 5200 games, but this was later contradicted by a worker who claimed that this was not the case. Atari official Bruce Enten stated that Atari was mostly sending broken and returned material to the Alamogordo dump and that it was ""by-and-large inoperable stuff.""On September 27, 1983, the news service UPI reported that ""people watching the operation said it included cassettes [sic] of the popular video games E.T., Pac-Man, Ms."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"Pac-Man, the consoles used to convey the games to television screens and high-priced personal computers."" The news service Knight Ridder further reported on the looting of the dump on September 28 by local kids, stating ""kids in this town of 25,000 began robbing the Atari grave, coming up with cartridges of such games as E.T., Raiders of the Lost Ark, Defender, and Berzerk.""On September 28, 1983, The New York Times reported on the story of Atari's dumping in New Mexico."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"An Atari representative confirmed the story for the newspaper, stating that the discarded inventory came from Atari's plant in El Paso, which was being closed and converted to a recycling facility. The reports noted that the site was guarded to prevent reporters and the public from affirming the contents. The Times article did not specify the games being destroyed, but subsequent reports generally linked the story of the dumping to the well-known failure of E.T."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"Additionally, the headline ""City to Atari: 'E.T.' trash go home"" in one edition of the Alamogordo News seems to imply some of the cartridges were E.T., but then follows with a humorous interpretation of E.T. meaning ""Extra-territorial"" and never specifically mentions the game.Starting on September 29, 1983, a layer of concrete was poured on top of the crushed materials, a rare occurrence in waste disposal. An anonymous workman's stated reason for the concrete was: ""There are dead animals down there."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"We wouldn't want any children to get hurt digging in the dump."" Eventually, the city began to protest the large amount of dumping Atari was doing, with one commissioner stating that the area did not want to become ""an industrial waste dump for El Paso."" The local manager ordered an end to the dumping shortly afterwards. Due to Atari's unpopular dumping, Alamogordo later passed an Emergency Management Act and created the Emergency Management Task Force to limit the future flexibility of the garbage contractor to secure outside business for the landfill for monetary purposes."
 Circumstances , Failed games ,"Alamogordo's then-mayor, Henry Pacelli, commented that, ""We do not want to see something like this happen again."""
 Burial , Cultural symbolism and speculation ,"All of these factors led to wide speculation that most of the 3.5 million unsold copies of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ultimately wound up in this landfill, crushed and encased in concrete. It had also been reported that prototypes for the proposed Atari Mindlink controller system were disposed of at the site, which only further fueled speculation, since Atari Museum owner Curt Vendel actually currently owns the Mindlink prototypes."
 Burial , Cultural symbolism and speculation ,"Writing for the Pacific Historical Review, John Wills speculated that location's place in the public psyche—its proximity to the sites of both the Trinity nuclear test and Roswell UFO incident—aided the popularity of the story.The conflicting information surrounding the burial led to the claim of it being an ""E.T. Dump"" being referred to as an urban legend, which in turn led to a degree of skepticism and doubt over the veracity of the dumping story itself, and the relevance of conflating the event with the later industry downturn. In October 2004, Howard Scott Warshaw, the programmer responsible for the E.T."
 Burial , Cultural symbolism and speculation ,"the Extra-Terrestrial game, expressed doubts at the time that the destruction of millions of copies of the game ever took place. Warshaw also believes that Atari's downfall was more a result of their business practices—including alleged block booking of poorly selling games with successful ones when dealing with distributors—than any specific failed games."
 Burial , Cultural symbolism and speculation ,"This latter view has been echoed by Travis Fahs of IGN, who believes that Atari's problems, including their huge surplus of unsold stock, arose from the company's overestimation of the sustainability of Atari 2600 sales, rather than being due to the individual quality of games being released.The incident has also become something of a cultural symbol representative of the video game crash of 1983, often cited as a cautionary tale about the hubris of poor business practices, despite suggestions that the burial allowed the company to write off the disposed-of material for tax relief purposes."
 Burial , In popular culture ,"The legacy of the burial has led it to be referenced in popular culture. The music video for the song ""When I Wake Up"" by Wintergreen depicts the band traveling to the landfill site and proceeding to dig up the abandoned cartridges; the video's director Keith Schofield had worked with video game-based music videos before. The novel Lucky Wander Boy by D.B. Weiss features a scene which takes place outside of Alamogordo, in which two of the characters discuss a parking lot which has been built over the site of the burial."
 Burial , In popular culture ,"The 2014 film Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie features a plot centered on the burial. The episode ""The Games Underfoot"" of the procedural drama Elementary featured a fictional version of the Atari (renamed ""Emeryvision"") video game burial. On May 28, 2013, the Alamogordo City Commission granted Fuel Industries, a Canadian entertainment company, six months of access to the landfill to film a documentary, Atari: Game Over, about the burial and to excavate the dump site."
 Burial , In popular culture ,"Xbox Entertainment Studios planned to air this documentary series as an exclusive to the Xbox One and Xbox 360 in 2014 as part of a multi-part documentary series being produced by Lightbox, a US/UK production company. Though the excavation was momentarily stalled due to a complaint by the New Mexico Environmental Protection Division Solid Waste Bureau citing potential hazards, the issues were resolved in early April 2014 to allow the excavation to proceed.Excavation started on April 26, 2014 as an open event to the public. E. T."
 Burial , In popular culture ,"the Extra-Terrestrial designer Howard Scott Warshaw, Ready Player One author Ernest Cline and film director Zak Penn attended the event as part of a documentary about the burial, as did local residents such as Armando Ortega, a city official who was reportedly one of the original children to raid the dump in 1983. Ortega stated that although he and his friends found dozens of quality games, they gave the E.T. cartridges away because the ""game sucked ... you couldn't finish it"". James Heller, the former Atari manager in charge of the original burial, was also on hand at the excavation."
 Burial , In popular culture ,"Heller revealed that he had originally ordered the site to be covered in concrete. Contrary to the urban legend that claims millions of cartridges were buried there, Heller stated that only 728,000 cartridges were buried.Remnants of E.T. and other Atari games were discovered in the early hours of the excavation, as reported by Microsoft's Larry Hryb."
 Burial , In popular culture ,"A team of archaeologists was present to examine and document the Atari material unearthed by excavation machinery: Andrew Reinhard (American School of Classical Studies at Athens), Richard Rothaus (Trefoil Cultural and Environmental), Bill Caraher (University of North Dakota), with support from video game historian Raiford Guins (Stony Brook University) and historian Bret Weber (University of North Dakota).Only about 1178 cartridges of the estimated 700,000 were removed from the burial, as the remaining materials were deeper than expected, which made them more difficult to access, according to Alamogordo mayor Susie Galea. The burial was refilled following this event."
 Burial , In popular culture ,"Joseph Lewandowski, who had worked to arrange the unearthing with the city, said that this was a one-time shot to recover materials from the site, as they do not expect the city to agree to a similar event again.The documentary Atari: Game Over, which features the burial site and its excavation, was released on November 20, 2014."
 Excavation , Curation and auction ,"Of the recovered materials, a fraction has been given to the New Mexico Museum of Space History for display, and another 100 to the documentary producers Lightbox and Fuel Entertainment. The Centre for Computing History in Cambridge, England also received some artifacts from the desert, which are on permanent display in the museum gallery. Galea believes the remaining cartridges can be sold by the city of Alamogordo through the Museum of Space History. She hopes that the sale of these games can help fund recognition of the burial site as a tourist attraction in the future."
 Excavation , Curation and auction ,"The City of Alamogordo approved the auction of the games in September 2014, to be sold through eBay and the Alamogordo Council website. As of September 2015, over $107,000 has been raised through the sales of about 880 unearthed cartridges, with one E.T. copy selling for more than $1,500. About 300 cartridges remain to be sold at a later date given the historical value of the cartridges.One of the E.T."
 Excavation , Curation and auction ,"cartridges that had been dug up was taken by the Smithsonian Institution for its records, calling the cartridge both representative of the burial site but also in terms of video games, how the cartridge represents ""the ongoing challenge of making a good film to a video game adaptation, the decline of Atari, the end of an era for video game manufacturing, and the video game cartridge life cycle"".

 History ,,"The AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors is a compilation of emission factors of air pollutants, in other words numbers which relate the quantity of a pollutant released into the ambient air with a certain activity. This compilation was first compiled and published by the US Public Health Service in 1968. In 1972, it was revised and issued as the second edition by the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA."
 History ,,"In 1985, the subsequent fourth edition was split into two volumes: Volume I has since included stationary point and area source emission factors, and Volume II includes mobile source emission factors. Volume I is currently in its fifth edition and is available on the Internet. Volume II is no longer maintained as such, but roadway air dispersion models for estimating emissions from on-road vehicles and from non-road vehicles and mobile equipment are available on the Internet.In routine common usage, Volume I of the emission factor compilation is very often referred to as simply AP 42."
 History ,,"Air pollution emission factors are usually expressed as the weight of the pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e.g., kilograms of particulate matter emitted per megagram of coal burned). The factors help to estimate emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases, the factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages."
 History ,,"The equation for the estimation of emissions before emission reduction controls are applied is: E = A × EFand for emissions after reduction controls are applied: E = A × EF × (1-ER/100)Emission factors are used by atmospheric dispersion modelers and others to determine the amount of air pollutants being emitted from sources within industrial facilities. Chapter 5, Section 5.1 ""Petroleum Refining"" discusses the air pollutant emissions from the equipment in the various refinery processing units as well as from the auxiliary steam-generating boilers, furnaces and engines, and Table 5.1.1 includes the pertinent emission factors."
 History ,,"Table 5.1.2 includes the emission factors for the fugitive air pollutant emissions from the large wet cooling towers in refineries and from the oil/water separators used in treating refinery wastewater. The fugitive air pollutant emission factors from relief valves, piping valves, open-ended piping lines or drains, piping flanges, sample connections, and seals on pump and compressor shafts are discussed and included in the report EPA-458/R-95-017, ""Protocol for Equipment Leak Emission Estimates"" which is included in the Chapter 5 section of AP 42."
 History ,,"That report includes the emission factors developed by the EPA for petroleum refineries and for the synthetic organic chemical industry (SOCMI). In most cases, the emission factors in Chapter 5 are included for both uncontrolled conditions before emission reduction controls are implemented and controlled conditions after specified emission reduction methods are implemented."
 History ,,"Chapter 7 ""Liquid Storage Tanks"" is devoted to the methodology for calculating the emissions losses from the six basic tank designs used for organic liquid storage: fixed roof (vertical and horizontal), external floating roof, domed external (or covered) floating roof, internal floating roof, variable vapor space, and pressure (low and high). The methodology in Chapter 7 was developed by the American Petroleum Institute in collaboration with the EPA. The EPA has developed a software program named ""TANKS"" which performs the Chapter 7 methodology for calculating emission losses from storage tanks."
 History ,,"The program's installer file along with a user manual, and the source code are available on the Internet.Chapters 5 and 7 discussed above are illustrative of the type of information contained in the other chapters of AP 42. Many of the fugitive emission factors in Chapter 5 and the emissions calculation methodology in Chapter 7 and the TANKS program also apply to many other industrial categories besides the petroleum industry.

 History ,,"Aerojet developed from a 1936 meeting hosted by Theodore von Kármán at his home. Joining von Kármán, who was at the time director of Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, were a number of Caltech professors and students, including rocket scientist and astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky and explosives expert Jack Parsons, all of whom were interested in the topic of spaceflight. The group continued to occasionally meet, but its activities were limited to discussions rather than experimentation."
 History ,,"Their first design was tested on August 16, 1941, consisting of a small cylindrical solid-fuel motor attached to the bottom of a plane. Takeoff distance was shortened by half, and the USAAF placed an order for experimental production versions."
 History , Founding ,"Some aspects of the early operation of the company were described by Kármán in his autobiography: On March 19, 1942, Haley obtained our incorporation papers and the Aerojet Engineering Corporation was launched. I was President; Malina was Treasurer; and Haley was Secretary. We had three vice-presidents: Parsons, Summerfield, and Forman. We issued stock to ourselves, and for a brief time Haley seemed to own the entire corporation because, being the only man in the group with cash, he actually put up all the initial capital. We opened offices on East Colorado Street in Pasadena ... we moved to ..."
 History , Founding ,"285 West Colorado Street...Thus began ... the world’s largest manufacturer of rockets and propellants. In only twenty years it was to grow from six people with a capitalization of $1200 into a 700-million-dollar a year business, a staff of nearly 34,000, and a key role in the modern defense picture of the United States.: 258 Kármán soon relinquished the presidency: ""Haley became Aerojet’s second president on August 26, 1942. He proved to be an incredible administrator."": 259 The company expanded and required new facilities: ""In October, fifteen employees were drawing paychecks."
 History , Founding ,"By December we had expanded to about one hundred and fifty employees and in January 1943 we moved to Azusa, California."": 260 In 1943 the Army Air Forces finally placed a full order, demanding that 2000 rockets be delivered before year's end. The difficulty of starting out in an industry with no history explains how the founders lost control: Unhappily for us, no bank would lend us money; bankers hadn’t yet come to think of rocketry as a stable business.: 315 In the spring of 1944 the officers instructed Haley to seek out new sources of assistance."
 History , Founding ,"General Tire & Rubber Company was one of his clients and that company showed an interest in Aerojet and began negotiations. In January 1945, General Tire acquired half the stock for $75,000. Parsons and Forman also sold their shares, so that, by October, General Tire had control of the majority of Aerojet.: 316, 7 Kármán resisted the offers presented to him, until in 1953 when a sizable scholarship fund was offered to be set up as a memorial to his sister Josephine de Karman."
 History , General Tire & Rubber Company ,"The company also invested in pure rocket research, developing both a liquid-fueled design and a new solid-fueled design based on a rubber binding agent in partnership with General Tire & Rubber Company. In the immediate post-war era, Aerojet downsized dramatically, but their JATO (jet-assisted take-off) units continued to sell for commercial aircraft operating in hot-and-high conditions. By 1950, their research into the rubber binder had led to much larger engines and then to the development of the Aerobee sounding rocket."
 History , General Tire & Rubber Company ,"Aerobee was the first U.S.-designed rocket to reach space (albeit not orbit) and completed over 1,000 flights before it was retired in 1985. Aerojet designed and built a total of 1,182 engines for all four incarnations of the Titan rockets, which were used for civilian projects ranging from Gemini's crewed flights to solar system explorations including Viking, Voyager, and Cassini. The newly formed US Air Force used Aerojet as the primary supplier on a number of their ICBM projects, including the Titan and Minuteman missiles. They also delivered propulsion systems for the US Navy's submarine-launched Polaris missile."
 History , General Tire & Rubber Company ,"A new plant was set up in Rancho Cordova that took over most rocket construction, while the original Azusa offices returned primarily to research. One of Azusa's major projects was the development of the infra-red detectors for the Defense Support Program satellites, used to detect ICBM launches from space. The new research arm was formed as Aerojet Electro-Systems Corp., and after purchasing a number of ordnance companies, Aerojet Ordnance was created as well. A new umbrella organization oversaw the three major divisions, Aerojet General."
 History , General Tire & Rubber Company ,"President Kennedy's challenge to place a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s led to increased civilian work at Aerojet. Previously, they had repeatedly lost contracts for large engines for the Saturn and Nova boosters, being designed in the late 1950s, often to their rival Rocketdyne, but in the end were selected to develop and build the main engine for the Apollo Command/Service Module."
 History , General Tire & Rubber Company ,"In 1962 they were also selected to design a new upper-stage engine to replace the cluster of five J-2s used on the Saturn second stage in the post-Apollo era, but work on their resulting M-1 design was ended in 1965 when it became clear the public's support for a massive space program was waning. During this period, Aerojet built a large concrete pad in San Ramon, California, for the purpose of rocket engine testing for the space program."
 History , General Tire & Rubber Company ,"Before it got used, President Johnson and NASA decided to move these activities to the upcoming space center in Houston, Texas.Similar work continued in the 1970s, delivering the second-stage motor for the MX missile, the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) for the Space Shuttle, and the first U.S.-designed cluster bombs. A contract for 30-mm ammunition for the A-10 Thunderbolt II was so extensive that new branch plants were set up in Downey and Chino in 1978. Aerojet also purchased a number of other firms over this period, and their plant in Jonesborough, Tennessee developed the use of depleted uranium ordnance."
 History , General Tire & Rubber Company ,"To this day they are the primary supplier of these weapons. Their electronics and ordnance divisions also collaborated on the SADARM 8"" anti-armor artillery round, but this was never put into production. The 1980s saw a brief revival of the aerospace business during President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative program, but the company shrank during the late 1980s and into the 1990s."
 History , 1990s ,"As Aerojet downsized, many of their industrial plants were idled, and the company looked for ways to capitalize them. Their massive investment in chemical mixing equipment used to build their solid-fuel rockets was later leased to third parties, notably pharmaceutical companies, under the name Aerojet Fine Chemicals. The division was later sold. Aerojet Real Estate was more direct in its actions, leasing entire Aerojet buildings and selling off undeveloped Aerojet land."
 History , 1990s ,"It owned approximately 12,600 acres (51 km2), located 15 miles (24 km) east of downtown Sacramento.The remaining research and development sections of Aerojet were organized into the Aerospace and Defense division (ADS). They continued to develop and produce liquid-fuel, solid-fuel, and air-breathing engines for strategic and tactical missiles, precision strike missiles, and interceptors required for missile defense."
 History , 1990s ,"Product applications for defense systems included strategic and tactical missile motors; maneuvering propulsion systems; attitude control systems; and warhead assemblies used in precision weapon systems and missile defense, as well as airframe structures required on the F-22 Raptor aircraft and fire suppression systems for military and commercial vehicles. Their space-related products included liquid-fuel engines for expendable and reusable launch vehicles, upper-stage engines, satellite propulsion, large solid boosters, and integrated propulsion subsystems. Aerojet qualified a 4.5-kW Hall effect thruster electric propulsion system based on technology licensed from the Busek Corporation."
 History , 1990s ,"Aerojet is under contract to Lockheed Martin to provide the first two shipsets of the new thruster system for the next generation Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, a US Air Force program. Research into the next generation of advanced or ""green"" monopropellant engines met with mixed success in the 1990s. HAN engines developed under contract to the US Air Force and Missile Defense Agency provided proof of concept."
 History , Recent history ,"Aerojet was owned by GenCorp, which is headquartered in Rancho Cordova, California. GenCorp was known as the General Tire & Rubber Company until 1984. On April 27, 2015, the corporate name of the company was officially changed from GenCorp, Inc. to Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. to honor the company's heritage of continuous product innovation and mission success and to recognize its significant contributions to national defense and space exploration for more than 70 years.From 2002, Aerojet grew steadily to more than 3,500 employees in 2008."
 History , Recent history ,"Aerojet's rocket engine for the Delta II second-stage completed a record 268 successful mission launches since 1960 on February 6, 2009. NASA chose Aerojet to provide the primary design and development of Orion (spacecraft) propulsion systems for the Constellation program. In November 2010, Aerojet was selected by NASA for consideration for potential contract awards for heavy lift launch vehicle system concepts and propulsion technologies.In July 2012, GenCorp announced that it was buying Aerojet's competitor, Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne; the acquisition was completed in 2013. Aerojet solid fuel technology was under consideration for use in Apollo's Saturn V first stages."
 History , Recent history ,"In 1963, the U.S. Air Force provided Aerojet General with $3 million in funding to start construction of a manufacturing and testing site several miles southwest of Homestead, Florida. Aerojet acquired the land for the plant less than five miles from Everglades National Park. A facility was constructed where the motors could be built and tested (25.362392°N 80.560649°W﻿ / 25.362392; -80.560649). SW 232nd Avenue was renamed ""Aerojet Road"". A monolithic 21-foot-diameter (6.4 m) rocket motor was designed, which was too big to be transported by rail."
 History , Recent history ,"A plan was devised where the rocket motors would be transported by barge to Cape Canaveral. To facilitate barges, a canal was dug (C-111) and a drawbridge installed for the U.S. Highway 1 crossing at mile marker 116 (25.289609°N 80.444786°W﻿ / 25.289609; -80.444786). This canal became the southernmost freshwater canal in Southeast Florida and was dubbed the ""Aerojet Canal"". Efforts are being made to remediate the long term environmental damage caused by the canal, which include the redirection of fresh water from Taylor Slough and thus Florida Bay to Barnes Sound."
 History , Recent history ,"Additionally, a concrete silo was constructed for the rocket motor, 180 feet deep into the Everglades. Aerojet needed a cylindrical chamber that would withstand the force and power a space-faring rocket would cause. Aerojet subcontracted the fabrication of 260-inch-diameter, 24m long chamber. The chambers were designed in short-length, meaning half the size of what the final product would be, hence the names given to the test rockets, SL-1, SL-2 and SL-3. Both motors used a propellant burning rate and nozzle size appropriate for the full length design and were capable of about 1,600,000 kgf thrust for 114 seconds."
 History , Recent history ,"The large amount of propellant needed for such a rocket was manufactured at the Everglades plant. An ignition motor, a knocked-down Polaris missile B3 first stage known as “Blowtorch,” was used to jump-start the motor. Between Sept. 25, 1965 and June 17, 1967, three static test firings were done. SL-1 was fired at night, and the flame was clearly visible from Miami 50 km away, producing over 3 million pounds of thrust. SL-2 was fired with similar success and relatively uneventful."
 History , Recent history ,"SL-3, the third and what would be the final test rocket, used a partially submerged nozzle and produced 2,670,000 kgf thrust, making it the largest solid-fuel rocket ever.Problems arose during the third test when, near burnout, the rocket nozzle was ejected, causing propellant made of hydrochloric acids to be spread across wetlands in the Everglades and a few crop fields and homes in Homestead."
 History , Recent history ,"Many residents of Homestead complained about the damage done, which included paint damage to their cars and the death of thousands of dollars worth of crops.By 1969, NASA had decided to go with liquid-fueled engines for the Saturn V rockets, causing the workers of the Everglades plant to be laid off and the abandonment of the facility. In 1986, after NASA had awarded the Space Shuttle booster contract to Morton Thiokol of Utah, Aerojet sued the State of Florida, exercised its options and pulled out of South Florida for good."
 History , Recent history ,"The company sold most of its land holdings to the South Dade Land Corporation for $6 million. After unsuccessfully trying to farm it, the corporation sold it to Florida for $12 million. County and federal courts were kept busy for years with lawsuits between Aerojet, Dade County and the State of Florida. After losing the Shuttle contract in 1986, Aerojet later traded its remaining 5,100 acres in the wetlands of South Dade for 55,000 acres of environmentally sensitive land belonging to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in Nevada."
 History , Recent history ,"Those 5,100 acres surrounding the factory site are now controlled by the South Florida Water Management District and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission as a nature preserve. The Aerojet signage still remains for both the road and canal, and although weather-damaged, most of the facility's buildings remain intact. The Nevada property was sold by Aerojet in 1996 to be used for the unbuilt planned community Coyote Springs, Nevada. The AJ-260-2 rocket motor remains in the silo to this day."
 History , Recent history ,"In 2013, the massive shed structure covering the silo was dismantled and the silo covered with several 33 ton concrete beams.The facility was the subject of documentaries Space-Miami and Aerojet Dade: An Unfinished Journey. An urban exploration visit to the site in 2007 was also featured in the documentary Urban Explorers: Into the Darkness. Aerojet's manufacture, testing and disposal methods led to toxic contamination of both the land and groundwater in the Rancho Cordova area, leading to the designation of a Superfund site."
 History , Recent history ,"Solvents such as trichloroethylene (TCE) and chloroform and rocket fuel by-products such as N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and perchlorate were discovered in drinking water wells near Aerojet in 1979. Since then, two State agencies and the Environmental Protection Agency have been working with Aerojet to ensure that the company cleans up pollution caused by its operations at the site. Under state and federal enforcement orders, Aerojet installed several systems on the borders of its property to pump out and treat contaminated groundwater. Aerojet has also conducted a number of removal actions for onsite soils, liquids, and sludges."
 History , Recent history ,"In 2003, groundwater sampling data revealed a plume of contamination extending northwest under Carmichael. Discovery of TCE contamination at the Sacramento facility also led Aerojet to look into possible contamination of the groundwater at Aerojet's Azusa facility, where much of the testing of JATO's and Rocket engines was conducted before those operations were moved to Sacramento. In 1980, it was announced that there was TCE contamination in the groundwater at Aerojet's facility in Azusa in a hearing chaired by State Senator Esteben Torres."
 History , Recent history ,"In 1985, it was declared a Superfund Site by the EPA as San Gabriel Superfund Site II and the cleanup done under the Baldwin Park Operable Unit. In 1997, it was also discovered that there was also NDMA and Ammonium Perchlorate contamination in this plume and that Aerojet was once again labeled a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) in this action. Aerojet sold this facility in 2001 to Northrop Grumman Corporation."
 History , Recent history ,"Aerojet's disposal of toxic material occurred 20 years prior to the establishment of a provisional perchlorate RfD limit of 0.0001 mg/kg/day in 1992 (to have been achieved by all companies by 1995). This limit was increased to 0.0009 mg/kg/day in 1998, and prior to the results from NAS studies, the limit was reduced to 0.00004 mg/kg/day in 2002. The NAS studies disputed the 0.00004 limit, and recommended its current limit of 0.0007 mg/kg/day."

 Area and water composition ,,"The lake has been slowly growing since 2003. It covers an area of more than sixty acres and the water is three times as salty as seawater. The casing in the well is corroded and the well hit a salt layer. The sulfate level is twenty-five times the legal limit for drinking water. In the 1940s or 1950s, oil wells were drilled near Imperial, Texas. None of them produced oil, but water and the oil companies deeded them to landowners who used them to irrigate farms, but they have fallen into disuse. The lake is named after former landowner Bernard Boehmer."
 Area and water composition ,,"The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation have tried to contact him via a registered letter to an address in Missouri, but it is not known if it reached him or if he replied.

 History ,,"The War Department purchased 7,500-acre (3,000 ha) of farmland east of Youngstown, New York, in 1941 as a location to manufacture TNT. The location was selected because of its proximity to chemical manufacturing plants, to Fort Niagara, to the New York Central Railroad, and to water and electrical power.The LOOW headquarters were at first located in a vegetable canning factory at the site.The 149 private landowners living there—mostly farmers and orchard growers—were given 30 days to move out, and most of their 125 farmhouses and 538 barns were torn down or burned."
 History ,,"Some homes located on the periphery of the LOOW boundary were kept.Construction of the TNT plant began in January 1941, and employed over 7,500 workers. The production and storage areas occupied approximately 2,500 acres (1,000 ha) near the center of property, and the remaining 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) was undeveloped and used as a ""buffer zone""."

 Buildings and operations , Building 401 ,"Beginning in 1943, Building 401 was used as the powerhouse for the production of TNT, though operations lasted less than a year. Building 401 was renovated, and from 1953–59 and 1965–71, it was used as a Boron-10 isotope separation plant. The interior of Building 401 was gutted in 1971, and its hardware and instrumentation were disposed of. Building 401 was demolished in 2010."
 Buildings and operations , Concrete silo ,"A 166 ft (51 m) concrete silo was erected within the east boundary of the LOOW, immediately next to Porter Center Road, which was publicly accessible. A fence with signs warning of ""radioactive material"" ran next to the road. In 1952, drums containing 3,869 short tons (3,510,000 kg) of highly-radioactive K-65 residues were loaded into the silo. The concrete silo was dismantled sometime after 1979."
 Buildings and operations , Interim waste containment structure ,"Construction of the interim waste containment structure was completed in 1991, and is located entirely within the Niagara Falls Storage Site. The 10-acre (4.0 ha) mound is used for the storage of radioactive waste and residues, and the grass-covered ""interim cap"" is designed to retard both rainwater infiltration and radon emission.All of the contaminated and radioactive materials stored at the former LOOW site—including thorium, uranium, and the world's largest concentration of radium-226—were placed into the structure."
 Buildings and operations , Rochester Burial Site ,"In 1951, laboratory waste and animals that had been injected with plutonium during experiments at the University of Rochester were shipped to the LOOW site for burial."
 Buildings and operations , US Army operations ,"The United States Army was given an 860-acre (350 ha) parcel of land from the original LOOW property, located on the northeast boundary. Beginning in 1957 it housed 36 Nike surface-to-air missiles intended to protect the nearby Niagara Hydroelectric Power Project. The property is currently licensed to the New York Army National Guard, and is used as a weekend training site."
 Buildings and operations , US Air Force operations ,"A 98-acre (40 ha) parcel of land from the original LOOW property was given to the United States Air Force, on which they located an experimental rocket fuel plant called the Youngstown Test Annex Site."
 Buildings and operations , Private waste treatment facilities ,"Hooker Chemical Company purchased a large portion of the original LOOW property from a private landowner in 1975 to use as a dump site. Waste Management, Inc currently owns and operates a 713-acre (289 ha) treatment, storage, disposal, and recovery facility near the center of the former LOOW property. It is the only hazardous waste landfill remaining in the Northeastern United States, and was the location where the anthrax-contaminated desk of news-anchor Tom Brokaw was disposed of in 2001. Modern Disposal Services operates a landfill on the former LOOW property."
 Buildings and operations , Other uses ,"Approximately 380 private residences and a mobile home park are located within the footprint of the former LOOW site. A school, several small farms, a 13-acre (5.3 ha) campground, and the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, which attracts thousands of visitors annually, are also located in the former LOOW site."
 Buildings and operations , Other uses ,"In 1981, the New York State Assembly Task Force on Toxic Substances wrote that the LOOW was ""born in the crisis of war"", and that: Federal mismanagement at the site was manifested by sloppy and deficient record-keeping procedures, inadequate mapping of buried wastes, and technological primitivism with regard to waste storage and removal. Moreover, it is clear that the site should never have been chosen for the storage of radioactive materials in the first place."

One portion of the property containing contaminated groundwater is listed as a Superfund cleanup site.A 2005 article in the Niagara Gazette alleged that radiation at the site was causing an ongoing hazard for the nearby Lewiston-Porter Central School District.
 Controversy ,,"In 1964, Peabody Energy (then Peabody Western Coal), a publicly traded energy company based in the Midwestern United States, signed a contract with the Navajo Tribe and two years later with the Hopi Tribe, allowing the company mineral rights and use of an aquifer. The contract was negotiated by prominent natural resources attorney John Sterling Boyden, who claimed to be representing the Hopi Tribe while actually on the payroll of Peabody. It offered unusually advantageous terms for Peabody and was approved despite widespread opposition."
 Controversy ,,"The contract is also controversial because of misrepresentations made to the Hopi and Navajo tribes.Peabody Energy developed two coal strip mines on the Black Mesa reservation: the Black Mesa Mine and the Kayenta Mine. Peabody Energy pumped water from the underground Navajo Aquifer for washing coal, and, until 2005, in a slurry pipeline operation to transport extracted coal to the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin, Nevada. With the pipeline operating, Peabody pumped, on average, 3 million gallons of water from the Navajo Aquifer every day."
 Controversy ,,"The aquifer is the main source of potable groundwater for the Navajo and Hopi tribes, who use the water for farming and livestock maintenance as well as drinking and other domestic uses. The tribes alleged that the pumping of water by Peabody Energy caused a severe decline in potable water and the number of springs. Both tribes, situated in an arid semi-desert, attach religious significance to water, considering it sacred, and have cultural, religious, and practical objections to over-use of water."
 Controversy ,,"Peabody's Black Mesa Mine used the slurry to pump its coal through pipes 273 mi (439 km) to where the coal could be filtered and used in the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin, Nevada (which was shut down in 2005). The generating station produced energy for Arizona and southern California and Nevada. This was the only coal slurry operation in the country and only plant that used groundwater for transport. Coal from the Kayenta mine was moved via conveyor belt to a silo from where it was loaded and shipped by train to the Navajo Generating Station coal plant."
 Controversy ,,"The Black Mesa Mine's last day of operation was December 31, 2005. The Office of Surface Mining approved Peabody's permit request to continue operations at the mine on December 22, 2008. However, in January 2010, an administrative law judge, on appeal of that approval, decided that the Final EIS did not satisfy the National Environmental Policy Act because it did not take into account changed conditions, and vacated the approval.Operations at the Kayenta Mine were ceased in 2019.

 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"In 2001, more than half the water samples taken from 53 DC-area homes under the procedures required by the EPA's Lead and Copper Rule showed levels of lead exceeding the national standard of 15 parts per billion (ppb). Lead disrupts the physical and mental development of fetuses, babies, and young children, and can cause kidney problems and high blood pressure in adults. The rule does not assume that there is a ""safe"" level of exposure, but notes that 15 ppb is an ""action level"" where utilities must take action."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"The rule was created in 1991, after research showed that drinking water could account for one-fifth of all lead intake. Lead is not normally present in drinking water; it is released from the inside surface of lead service lines (pipes that run from the main to the house), joints connected with lead-based solder, and lead fixtures inside the house. Based on these findings, WASA was required to notify the public and implement plans to replace lead service lines in key areas of the municipal water system."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"The first media attention came in late 2002, when the Washington City Paper ran an article about a resident of American University Park whose water tested six to 18 times the EPA Lead and Copper Rule's action level. WASA found that homes in its service area with lead service lines averaged five times the EPA limit for lead during a year-long period. The results were unexpected; the EPA scientist overseeing DC's water suggested that drought conditions might have raised the alkalinity levels of the Potomac River, leading to a change in the pH of the water."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"As a result, WASA was required to start replacing seven percent of the district's lead service lines each year until the levels dropped below 0.015 milligrams per liter. At the time, about 23,000 WASA customers had lead service lines.In March 2003, Marc Edwards, a professor of civil engineering and expert on corrosion in drinking-water systems, was conducting research into an unexpected increase in pinhole leaks in copper water pipes in the DC area. WASA funded Edwards's research."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Suspecting the leaks were caused by a change in the water chemistry, Edwards used a field meter to test for lead in one home's water. The meter could read values up to 140 ppb. His initial reading pegged the meter, so he diluted the sample to ten percent of its original strength. Even so, diluted, the sample still pegged the meter, indicating the water contained at least 1,250 ppb of lead."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"""Some of it would literally have to be classified as a hazardous waste,"" Edwards said.After Seema Bhat, a water quality manager at WASA, told her superiors at the agency and at the EPA about the lead levels and warned that federal guidelines required aggressive action, she was fired by the agency. A federal investigator found that she had been improperly terminated.The lead levels required WASA to conduct a wider survey of their water quality."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"By the fall of 2003, it had tested more than 6,000 homes in the District, finding that two-thirds tested had more than 15 ppb of lead in their water. The survey showed that over 4,000 homes served by WASA had lead levels exceeding the acceptable level. More than a third of the homes surveyed—2,287 out of 6,118—had levels exceeding 50 ppb. The water tested over 300 ppb in 157 homes."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Despite this result, WASA did not notify its customers of the risk until November 2003.Although regulations required WASA to include the specific warning ""Some homes in this community have elevated lead levels in their drinking water."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Lead can pose a significant risk to your health."" In the water bills of each affected customer, WASA's notice omitted key parts of the phrase such as ""in their drinking water"" and ""significant."" Although Federal law required WASA to hold public meetings to discuss the problem and actions people could take to protect themselves, they advertised the meetings as being ""to discuss and solicit public comments on WASA's Safe Drinking Water Act projects,"" omitting mention of lead. The EPA was required to review the notice before it was sent out; one D.C."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Council member, commenting on the EPA's approval of the faulty notice, asked ""Where were you, EPA?"" The EPA later found that WASA's notice violated federal law because of the omissions.In January 2004, the Washington Post reported that the mayor and several D.C. Council members had not been informed of the elevated lead levels. The Washington City Paper said that Carol Schwartz, the councilmember who chaired the Committee on Public Works and the Environment, was not informed of the lead issue until that newspaper contacted her during the last week of January 2004."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Early communications from WASA limited the health advisory to pregnant women and small children in homes with lead service leads, but later tests showed the high lead levels were also present in homes with copper service leads.Meanwhile, on January 2, 2004, WASA called Edwards and threatened to cut off his access to monitoring data needed for his research, and divert funding from him to other researchers, unless he stopped working with the homeowners whose water showed high lead levels. Soon after, the EPA discontinued its own contract with Edwards."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"The issue became front-page news when the Washington Post ran an article titled ""Water in D.C. Exceeds EPA Lead Limit"" on January 31, 2004 across six columns of page A1. Reporter David Nakamura was contacted by one of the homeowners whose water was tested by WASA during its survey after he received the test results. Nakamura—who had no prior experience with clean water issues—initially thought it was a minor issue, but agreed to help the homeowner get a response from WASA. When WASA would not give him a straight answer, Nakamura pressed them for full data on the tests."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Nakamura says that, even though he was ""stunned"" at the facts reported in that first story, the Post ""had no idea about the size and scope of what was to follow.""The article quoted Erik Olson, an analyst for the Natural Resources Defense Council, as saying ""This is a really big deal..."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"If schools go over 20 parts per billion, they immediately take the water out of production."" WASA recommended that residents let the tap run for 30 seconds to one minute before using it to reduce the risk.This first Post article was the first public mention of the theory that the lead levels were tied to monochloramine. The traditional use of chlorine had been stopped four years earlier, out of concerns that it could produce harmful chemicals in the pipes. Long-term exposure to the byproducts from chlorine treatment has been linked with cancer."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,The paper quoted officials as saying that it was possible chloramine was more corrosive to lead pipes.
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"(In fact, the Army Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for the Washington Aqueduct that supplies water to WASA, rejected a recommendation to add phosphates to the water to prevent lead leaching in the mid-1990s.) The change to chloramine was made after the EPA issued regulations concerning disinfection byproducts formed when chlorine reacts with organic matter in drinking water; the EPA considered these byproducts to be a potential health threat.After the first article, the Post formed a core team of reporters to investigate the issue."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Nakamura was joined by reporters Carol Leonnig, Jo Becker, Avram Goldstein, and D'Vera Cohn; editor Marcia Slacum Greene provided daily oversight. Nakamura was the lead reporter for the breaking news coming from WASA and City Hall, and wrote profiles of key players. Leonnig reported on the federal and EPA response to the contamination. Cohn investigated the Washington Aqueduct angle and worked with water quality and environmental experts. Goldstein covered the DC Department of Health."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Becker looked at water quality nationwide.After the first article appeared, residents inundated WASA's water hotline with calls and overwhelmed water testing laboratories with requests to have their tap water tested for lead contamination. District elected officials immediately called for an emergency public meeting, and established an inter-agency task force with the EPA to investigate and manage the problem."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"However, messages to the public at the time were often confusing and contradictory: while WASA was suggesting running taps for 90 seconds to flush out any lead, the EPA was demanding that recommendation be changed to ten minutes.The Post article lead WASA to hand out over 30,000 free water filters, hire health experts, and offer free blood tests to residents. Some water fountains were turned off due to lead levels. In 2004, the D.C. Council held 11 oversight hearings on the issue; the US Congress held four."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"American University claimed that its water was safe to drink, because the larger water mains feeding commercial sites like the college were not made of lead.After Nakamura's first few stories for the Post on the issue, he was contacted by Seema Bhat's attorney. Bhat, who was then fighting her dismissal from WASA, shared thousands of internal documents with Nakamura. The documents, Nakamura said, ""provided a fairly clear picture"" that WASA had been trying to find a way to avoid the cost of replacing pipes and adding additional chemicals to the water. He said Bhat's documents were critical to the Post's investigation."

 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"In July, a WASA-commissioned report supported the Post's claims that the agency had known about the high lead levels for years, but had failed to notify regulators or the public. In August 2004, the Army Corps of Engineers started adding orthophosphate to the water in hopes of preventing lead leeching. By November, WASA's board of directors had committed to a plan that would replace all of the agency's 23,000 lead pipes by 2010, at a cost of $300 million—starting with 2,800 lead pipes to be replaced in 2005. WASA estimated that the repairs would cost residents $6 to $7 a month."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"The agency was not legally responsible for the portion of the lead service lines within a homeowner's property lines; however, they offered to perform the work at a set rate, and arranged a low-interest loan program with Wachovia Bank to help homeowners afford the cost.By January 31, 2005, the Post had run over 200 stories on the issue, amassing thousands of pages of correspondence through the Freedom of Information Act."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Gloria Borland, a District resident, testified before Congress: ""If the [Washington] Post had not exposed this scandal, our children today would still be drinking lead contaminated water.""Post reporters Nakamura, Leonnig, Cohn, Becker, Craig Timberg, Monte Reel, and Sarah Cohen won the 2005 Selden Ring Award for Investigative Reporting for the articles."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Michael Parks, director of USC Annenberg's School of Journalism and Pulitzer Prize-winning former editor of the Los Angeles Times, said ""The Washington Post's work was a very important piece of journalism—important to every man, woman and child living in the District of Columbia, drinking its water and thinking it was pure. And it was important to the residents of other cities whose water is contaminated by lead and other toxic substances."" The award's cash prize of $35,000 is believed to be the largest in journalism."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"According to Nakamura, some at the Post were surprised to win the award, because of the atypical nature of the Post's investigation. Most winners conduct a long-term investigation and then publish long articles over a few days with the results; the Post covered the investigation as a series of beat stories. Nakamura said he had never heard of the Selden Ring Award until the day his editor told him that the team had won it."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"On March 30, 2004, an ""MMWR dispatch,"" Blood Lead Levels in Residents of Homes with Elevated Lead in Tap Water --- District of Columbia, 2004, was made available on the MMWR web site."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"It was then published by CDC as ""MMWR Weekly, April 2, 2004 / 53(12);268-270."" The report ""summarizes the results of the preliminary investigations, which indicated that the elevated water lead levels might have contributed to a small increase in blood lead levels (BLLs)."" The report describes the background, and the various kinds of blood tests it employed, and explicitly states: ""All blood tests were used in this analysis."" There is no mention at all of any test results not being available, not even in the caveat section, where other potential sources of error are discussed."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"The report concludes that the high amounts of lead in the drinking water may have led to a slight rise of the blood levels; however, not to the levels of official concern. It also claims that the average levels were sinking. However, the report notes that there is no known ""risk free"" level, and therefore recommends that efforts should be made to eliminate lead in children's blood entirely. The report later was strongly criticized, both by Marc Edwards and by the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology; see § Congressional review of the 2004 CDC paper."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"At an oversight hearing before the House Committee on Government Reform in early March 2004, Marc Edwards testified that his studies showed the change from chlorine to chloramine was the cause of the elevated lead levels. He stated that the chloramine-treated water was leaching lead not only from the old lead lines, but also from brass fixtures in homes. Brass is made with lead; even brass classified as ""lead free"" under the Safe Drinking Water Act can contain up to eight percent lead."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Edwards said that this could be the cause of the high lead levels in areas where WASA did not use lead lines. He also cautioned that replacing lead service lines with copper could make the problem worse; newly installed copper lines could react with the chloramine in a way that would increase corrosion of the remaining lead lines in the system. The chief of the Washington Aqueduct disagreed, saying that tests taken after the chloramine treatment commenced didn't show any additional corrosiveness. He believed corrosion inhibitors, like orthophosphate, could be added to the water to prevent lead leaching."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"In the spring of 2004, a temporary switch from chloramine back to chlorine for annual pipe flushing caused a 25 to 30 percent drop in lead levels, lending credence to the chloramine theory. In one home that was tested by WASA before and after the switch, lead levels dropped tenfold.On March 23, 2004, Anthony A. Williams (the mayor of the District of Columbia) and Carol Schwartz (chair of the DC Council's Committee on Public Works and the Environment) wrote a letter to President George W."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Bush, asking the federal government to reimburse WASA $24,093,700 and the District of Columbia $1,730,401 to cover expenses from the lead contamination. The letter justified the request for full reimbursement by saying ""the regulatory decisions of EPA appear to have generated these costs"" and that it would be ""inherently unfair"" for taxpayers and WASA customers to pay those costs. In 2005, President Bush proposed cutting the EPA's budget by almost a half-billion dollars, mostly from clean-water programs."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"He wanted to decrease spending on replacing aging water facilities by 83 percent.On March 30, 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) that found the lead ""might have contributed a small increase in blood lead levels."" The report claimed that no children with dangerously high blood lead levels were found, even in the homes with the worst lead levels. Officials in other cities, such as New York City and Seattle, cited the report as justification for a less-than-aggressive response to high lead levels in their own water."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Water testing in the first six months of 2004 showed 90 percent of homes having 63 ppb of lead or less in the water.In October 2004, Edwards co-authored an article in the Journal of the American Water Works Association that linked chloramine use with greatly increased lead leaching.A report commissioned by the D.C. Council released on December 8, 2004 faulted the federal government's regulation of the city's water supply as a factor in the lead contamination."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"The report noted that no one agency was responsible for the water quality: The Army Corps of Engineers treated the water, WASA delivered it, and the EPA performed the quality checks. It urged the Council to assume authority for the entire system. In the last six months of 2004, 90 percent of homes tested had lead levels of 59 ppb or lower.The city's interim inspector general, Austin A. Andersen, released a report on WASA's performance in January 2005."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Andersen called for WASA to enter a formal agreement with the city's Health Department to ensure that future communications about water health issues were timely and worded appropriately. WASA rejected the need for such an agreement. That same month, the Architect of the Capitol issued a warning to Capitol Hill employees that they should not use water from bathroom or kitchen faucets for drinking or cooking. Some water fountains on the campus were turned off, although employees were told it was okay to continue using the others."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"One home on Capitol Hill was found to have 308 ppb of lead in 2003.On January 21, 2005, the EPA ordered WASA to notify more than 400 homeowners that the agency had mistakenly told them their house's water lead levels were safe, and to replace an additional 500 service lines to comply with federal law. The EPA said that WASA had flushed the water line for five minutes before running the lead tests for those homes, resulting in artificially low readings; such a lengthy flush is not permitted by EPA standards."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"The EPA did not believe that the flushes were done intentionally by WASA to reduce lead levels. The testing had been done as part of an effort to avoid the expense of replacing lead lines in areas where it found low lead levels. In 1999, an EPA survey estimated that the United States's drinking-water systems were in need of $150 billion worth of repairs over the following 20 years."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"However, in April 2004, an EPA spokesperson told the Washington Times that ""high lead levels are not a pervasive problem."" At a Congressional hearing that month, the EPA testified that it had no current information on lead levels in 78 percent of the nation's water systems, and that as many as 20 states had not provided any data.On October 5, 2004, the Washington Post ran a front-page article reporting that cities across the United States were illegally manipulating lead testing results, such as discarding high readings or avoiding homes likely to have high readings."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"A former EPA official described it as ""widespread fraud and manipulation"" on the part of water utilities. That July, however, an EPA administrator told Congress that ""we have not identified a systemic problem."" Using data from the EPA, the Post identified 274 utilities that had reported unsafe lead levels between 2000 and 2004."

 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,Regulators in Michigan and Oregon also investigated utilities singled out by the Post in those states. Senators James M. Jeffords and Paul S. Sarbanes called for the EPA to impose tougher standards; Jeffords and Senator Hillary Clinton called for an investigation of the EPA following the Post's findings.Seattle had already suffered widespread lead contamination in its public school system in 2003.
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"One parent, a scientist who had initiated the investigation there, said ""we continue to suffer from an epidemic of lead complacency"" nationwide.The EPA said that between 2003 and 2005, only four large water systems had unsafe lead levels: Washington, DC; St. Paul, Minnesota; Port St. Lucie, Florida; and Ridgewood, New Jersey. By January 2005, a year after the high lead levels were publicized by the Post, advocates were calling for the firing of local and federal officials involved in the issue, saying that they had done too little to fix the problem."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Eric Olsen of the Natural Resources Defense Council said that officials ""have fallen down on the job"" because thousands of residents still had unsafe water. The group Lead Emergency Action for the District called for an overhaul of WASA's management, an independent study of needed improvements to the water system, stronger laws, and action from the EPA. ""We want fines and a criminal review,"" said Olsen.In March 2005, the EPA proposed changes strengthening the Lead and Copper Rule. The changes require utilities to give test results directly to homeowners, and to notify state and federal regulators before changing water-treatment methods."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Critics, such as Clean Water Action, called the changes ""revisions at the margins."" Rick Maas, co-director of the Environmental Quality Institute at the University of North Carolina, said the revisions would ""solve maybe 5 to 10 percent of the problem"" with the Rule. Trade organizations, such as the American Water Works Association, found the changes ""basically reasonable.""That month, WASA said that recent tests showed encouraging declines in lead levels, which it attributed to the orthophosphate treatments started in August 2004."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Out of 51 homes tested, only four had readings above 15 ppb; ten of those homes were above the 15-ppb standard the previous year, but fell below it in this test. WASA also noted that the Army Corps of Engineers would continue using chloramine throughout the year to keep the water chemistry stable. By May 10, 2005, the company was announcing that its tests were ""below the '90th percentile lead action level.""As of January 2006, WASA said that about 29 percent of its customers had chosen to replace the lead service lines within the customer's property."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"In a January press release, WASA said that the average lead level in its most recent tests was 7 ppb. The authority also claimed that a voluntary blood-lead-level screening it funded showed no identifiable public health impact from the elevated lead levels.The EPA formally reduced its oversight of WASA in May 2006, after testing showed the lead levels had remained below 15 ppb for a full year."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"However, the agency continued to require WASA to submit 100 samples every six months for at least another year; the normal requirement is 50 samples a year.Even after the lead levels abated, the Post continued to note other problems with the District's water supply. In 2007, it noted that WASA's periodic ""chlorine surge"" resulted in high levels of haloacetic acids, a chlorine disinfection byproduct believed to be unsafe. Utilities use annual or biannual chlorine surges to remove pathogens such as cryptosporidium that are not adequately killed by chloramine."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Officials from the Washington Aqueduct and WASA said the levels were probably temporary and that the water was safe to drink. In January 2006, the Government Accountability Office released a study criticizing the EPA's efforts monitoring lead levels in drinking water across the United States."
 2001–04: Initial reports of elevated lead ,,"Although the study found that lead in drinking water had generally declined since the 1990s, it noted that data collection problems ""may be undermining the intended level of public health protection."" There have been studies that show that there is no safe level for lead consumption.In their 2010 water quality report, DC Water stated that there was lead found in some water samples taken during monitoring. The possible causes linked to the lead contamination was said to be ""corrosion of household plumbing systems; erosion of natural deposits."" The report did not state where the lead was found or who it impacted."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Guidotti paper ,"In 2007, the journal Environmental Health Perspectives published a paper about the public health response to the lead contamination, written by a team of academic investigators headed by Tee Guidotti of George Washington University. Guidotti and his team had been hired as consultants by WASA in 2004; he had told the WASA board that water only accounts for seven percent of the typical two-year-old child's lead exposure. The paper analyzed data from the 2004 screening program, identifying sources of confounding or bias."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Guidotti paper ,"Four indicators were examined, and none showed evidence that blood lead levels had been affected by the elevation of lead in drinking water. The investigators concluded that the evidence did not clearly demonstrate a correlation between lead in the District's drinking water and blood lead levels. However, they cautioned that a population study was not suitable for establishing such relationships. They called for reduction in exposure from water as well as from other sources."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Guidotti paper ,"The paper stated ""There appears to have been no identifiable public health impact from the elevation of lead in drinking water in Washington DC in 2003 and 2004.""The Guidotti paper was called into question by members of the DC Council in February 2009, after the Washington Post ran an article about a more recent study by Marc Edwards that found a correlation between water and blood lead levels in area children."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Guidotti paper ,"The National Institutes of Health, publisher of the journal in which the paper appeared, were unaware that George Washington University's contract with WASA gave the water authority final approval over anything Guidotti wrote concerning the authority. Guidotti was also supposed to remove the sentence about public health impact from the paper before publication, because experts reviewing the paper had rejected that finding; he failed to do so. Guidotti and WASA both denied that the agency influenced the paper; Guidotti said he didn't view the contract as giving WASA preapproval over the paper, and therefore didn't disclose it to the journal."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Guidotti paper ,"In an August 2006 e-mail obtained by the Post from Edwards, Guidotti agreed to replace the sentence with ""Measures to protect residents from exposure to lead in drinking water may have prevented more frequent elevations in blood lead"" before its publication, but that did not happen. The journal refuses to accept research that is under a sponsor's control; it conducted a review to determine if the paper should be retracted—the journal's first such review in its 30-year history."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Guidotti paper ,"The paper had been cited as evidence that the lead contamination had not harmed District residents.In an e-mail to the Washington City Paper, Guidotti refuted any claims that WASA influenced the team's findings. He clarified that WASA's contract was with the university, not Guidotti personally."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Guidotti paper ,"He said ""The data in our 2007 study are valid, the analysis was accurately reported, and we stand by the conclusions.""The review panel convened by Environmental Health Perspectives released its findings in June 2009, finding that the controversial sentence was included due to ""inattention to detail"" and found no evidence that Guidotti was trying to mislead readers. The panel recommended that Guidotti submit an apology and correction; he did so. The panel said it found evidence that neither Guidotti nor WASA intended for the utility to exercise approval over the research conclusions."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Edwards paper ,"The March 1, 2009 issue of Environmental Science and Technology included a paper by Marc Edwards, Simoni Triantafyllidou, and Dana Best that established a link between the elevated lead levels in the drinking water and potentially harmful blood lead levels in area children. The Washington Post announced the results of that study on January 27, 2009. The report found that 42,000 children who were in the womb or under age 2 during the contamination are at risk of health and behavioral problems."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Edwards paper ,"In some areas, the number of children with enough lead to cause irreversible IQ loss and developmental delays more than doubled between 2000 and 2003. These findings contradicted previous statements by WASA that there were no health impacts, as well as the 2004 CDC MMWR report. David Bellinger, a Harvard University neurologist, told the Post, ""If these data were available previously, I would be surprised that anyone would be assuring the public there was no problem.""The CDC refused to provide Edwards with the data necessary to perform the study."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Edwards paper ,He convinced the Children's National Medical Center to share the data with him in 2008.The paper won the Editor's Choice Award for Best Science Paper of 2009 from the editors of Environmental Science and Technology.
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Congressional review of the 2004 CDC paper ,"Edwards's study raised new questions about the March 2004 CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report that downplayed the health impact of the lead contamination. Salon noted that the CDC had found a link between lead pipes and high childhood blood lead levels in the district in 2007, but did not publicize the study. The principal author of the 2004 study—Mary Jean Brown, who co-authored the 2007 study—acknowledged that thousands of blood tests were missing from the 2004 study, but defended the paper's conclusion that any harm was slight."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Congressional review of the 2004 CDC paper ,"""There is no indication that DC residents have blood lead levels above the CDC levels of concern,"" she wrote.However, Edwards's results came from analysis of the same data used for the 2004 CDC report. When he wrote to the CDC's associate director of science, questioning the report's conclusions and methodology, he received a belated reply: ""We have examined CDC's role in the study and have found no evidence of misconduct.""The United States House of Representatives' Science and Technology Committee opened a congressional investigation into the 2004 CDC report."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Congressional review of the 2004 CDC paper ,"Investigators found that although the CDC and city health department reported dangerous lead levels in 193 children in 2003, the actual number was 486 according to records taken directly from the testing laboratories. Representative Brad Miller of North Carolina called the CDC report's data ""wildly incomplete."" The underreported results came from the city's health department, which had said the missing tests were omitted because some labs did not report low lead levels to the city."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Congressional review of the 2004 CDC paper ,"The health department data was also the basis for Guidotti's paper.The investigation found that the CDC knowingly used flawed data in drafting the report, leading to ""scientifically indefensible"" claims in the 2004 paper. It also cited the CDC for failing to publicize later research showing that the harm was more serious than the 2004 report suggested."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Congressional review of the 2004 CDC paper ,"After the investigation's findings were released, the CDC initially stood by the report's findings that no significant harm was caused by the lead, but acknowledged that the claim that no children with lead poisoning had been found was ""misleading."" Edwards called for the CDC to retract the paper and for Brown's resignation. ""If you were a child living in D.C. at that time, a single glass of tap water could have elevated your blood lead to unsafe levels,"" said Edwards.The report strongly criticized Brown for failing to check the original lab results."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Congressional review of the 2004 CDC paper ,"It also noted that one section of the 2004 CDC report said not one of the people living in a home with water lead levels 20 times higher than the action level had elevated blood lead, but it failed to mention that most of those people were drinking bottled or filtered water, not tap water, before their blood was tested—a fact Brown and her co-authors were well aware of."

" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Congressional review of the 2004 CDC paper ,"According to the UAS, Tommy Thompson, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, took the unprecedented step of rejecting a number of nominees to the committee selected by staff scientists. Instead, the group claims, Thompson appointed at least two appointees with financial ties to the lead industry. A 2010 Washington Post editorial cited the group's statement as a reason why the District's lead contamination ""was practically inevitable"" due to politicization of the CDC.Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Delegate to Congress representing the District, accused the CDC of a coverup."

A 2010 study by Brown at the CDC essentially confirmed Edwards's findings. It also found that the 15,000 ""partial pipe replacements"" performed by WASA—where lead service lines were replaced up to a homeowner's property line, but no further—may not have effectively reduced lead levels, and may have made the problem worse."

A Post article about the report lead to jammed phone lines at WASA and increased demand for bottled-water delivery. The study indicated that there is no safe level of lead in drinking water, and that children in homes with even a partial lead service line are at a much higher risk of lead poisoning than those with no lead in the line."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", Congressional review of the 2004 CDC paper ,"WASA said the finding ""is not news"" to them; General Manager George Hawkins told WAMU that the utility had been acting as if the CDC's findings were fact for some time before the report was released.

Parkhurst, a 50-year-old single father and psychologist, prepared food and formula for the boys using tap water from the time they were 8 months old until 2002, when they were two years old."

The agency said that such claims would need to be substantiated on a case-by-case basis. WASA's motion to dismiss the complaint was denied in October 2009."

Within this new outlet, there are several articles that use incriminating and extreme headlines to grab the readers attention about the DC Water system. Many media outlets have compared the Flint Water Crisis to the decades old water issue in Washington, DC because both problems pertain to lead in drinking water."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", After Flint ,"In 2017, the DC Water Quality Report, Washington DC was found to be in compliance with the EPA's standards for lead within drinking water. However, there is no safe level of lead for children to consume. According to the EPA, lead at any level can be harmful. The EPA has a maximum contamination goal of zero; however, they have not stated how or when they are going to enforce the regulation if it is amended.During the summer of 2018, Washington DC issued a boil water advisory to all of its residents in the North East and North West areas."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", After Flint ,"This was done as a precaution to citizens since the water did test positive for many different harmful contaminants in the tested areas. In 2018, DC Water's Drinking Water Quality Report states that there is infrastructure in Washington, DC that contains lead that may impact the drinking water in certain areas. Tips for how to prevent contamination are provided on the report. All the lead pipes in Washington, DC have not been replaced and those that remain may cause problems for those consuming the water."
" 2006–10: EPA, CDC,  and other expert reports faulted ", After Flint ,"DC Water created an interactive map to show its residents which pipe lines are made out of lead or other dangerous metals. The information was gathered from historical data and inspections. An article published in 2018 by CNN states that the EPA gave the Virginia Tech researcher that found the lead within Flint, MI's and Washington, DC's water supplies a grant to search other major cities. The grant consists of $1.9 million dollars and will be used to help people where there is a suspicion of lead being in their drinking water but government officials aren't acting on it."

 History ,,"CERCLA was enacted by Congress in 1980 in response to the threat of hazardous waste sites, typified by the Love Canal disaster in New York, and the Valley of the Drums in Kentucky. It was recognized that funding would be difficult, since the responsible parties were not easily found, and so the Superfund was established to provide funding through a taxing mechanism on certain industries and to create a comprehensive liability framework to be able to hold a broader range of parties responsible."
 History ,,"The initial Superfund trust fund to clean up sites where a polluter could not be identified, could not or would not pay (bankruptcy or refusal), consisted of about $1.6 billion and then increased to $8.5 billion. Initially, the framework for implementing the program came from the oil and hazardous substances National Contingency Plan. The EPA published the first Hazard Ranking System in 1981, and the first National Priorities List in 1983."
 History ,,"Implementation of the program in early years, during the Ronald Reagan administration, was ineffective, with only 16 of the 799 Superfund sites cleaned up and only $40 million of $700 million in recoverable funds from responsible parties collected. The mismanagement of the program under Anne Gorsuch Burford, Reagan's first chosen Administrator of the agency, led to a congressional investigation and the reauthorization of the program in 1986 through an act amending CERCLA."
 History , 1986 amendments ,The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) added minimum cleanup requirements in Section 121 and required that most cleanup agreements with polluters be entered in federal court as a consent decree subject to public comment (section 122). This was to address sweetheart deals between industry and the Reagan-era EPA that Congress had discovered.
 History , Environmental justice initiative ,"In 1994 President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which called for federal agencies to make achieving environmental justice a requirement by addressing low income populations and minority populations that have experienced disproportionate adverse health and environmental effects as a result of their programs, policies, and activities. The EPA regional offices had to apply required guidelines for its Superfund managers to take into consideration data analysis, managed public participation, and economic opportunity when considering the geography of toxic waste site remediation."
 History , Environmental justice initiative ,"Some environmentalists and industry lobbyists saw the Clinton administration's environmental justice policy as an improvement, but the order did not receive bipartisan support. The newly elected Republican Congress made numerous unsuccessful efforts to significantly weaken the program. The Clinton administration then adopted some industry favored reforms as policy and blocked most major changes."
 History , Decline of excise tax ,"Until the mid-1990s, most of the funding came from an excise tax on the petroleum and chemical industries, reflecting the polluter pays principle. Even though by 1995 the Superfund balance had decreased to about $4 billion, Congress chose not to reauthorize collection of the tax, and by 2003 the fund was empty.: 1 Since 2001, most of the funding for cleanups of hazardous waste sites has come from taxpayers. State governments pay 10 percent of cleanup costs in general, and at least 50 percent of cleanup costs if the state operated the facility responsible for contamination."
 History , Decline of excise tax ,"By 2013 federal funding for the program had decreased from $2 billion in 1999 to less than $1.1 billion (in constant dollars).: 11 In 2001 EPA used funds from the Superfund program to institute the cleanup of anthrax on Capitol Hill after the 2001 Anthrax Attacks. It was the first time the agency dealt with a biological release rather than a chemical or oil spill. From 2000 to 2015, Congress allocated about $1.26 billion of general revenue to the Superfund program each year. Consequently, less than half the number of sites were cleaned up from 2001 to 2008, compared to before."
 History , Decline of excise tax ,"The decrease continued during the Obama administration, and since under the direction of EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy Superfund cleanups decreased even more from 20 in 2009 to a mere 8 in 2014.: 8"
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"In November 2021 Congress reauthorized an excise tax on chemical manufacturers, under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The new chemical excise tax is effective July 1, 2022, and is double the rate of the previous Superfund tax. The 2021 law also authorized $3.5 billion in emergency appropriations from the U.S. government general fund for hazardous site cleanups in the immediate future. CERCLA authorizes two kinds of response actions: Removal actions. These are typically short-term response actions, where actions may be taken to address releases or threatened releases requiring prompt response."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"Removal actions are classified as: (1) emergency; (2) time-critical; and (3) non-time critical. Removal responses are generally used to address localized risks such as abandoned drums containing hazardous substances, and contaminated surface soils posing acute risks to human health or the environment. Remedial actions. These are usually long-term response actions. Remedial actions seek to permanently and significantly reduce the risks associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances, and are generally larger, more expensive actions. They can include measures such as using containment to prevent pollutants from migrating, and combinations of removing, treating, or neutralizing toxic substances."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"These actions can be conducted with federal funding only at sites listed on the EPA National Priorities List (NPL) in the United States and the territories. Remedial action by responsible parties under consent decrees or unilateral administrative orders with EPA oversight may be performed at both NPL and non-NPL sites, commonly called Superfund Alternative Sites in published EPA guidance and policy documents.A potentially responsible party (PRP) is a possible polluter who may eventually be held liable under CERCLA for the contamination or misuse of a particular property or resource."

 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"Buyers also have to be aware of future liabilities.The CERCLA also required the revision of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan 9605(a)(NCP). The NCP guides how to respond to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. The NCP established the National Priorities List, which appears as Appendix B to the NCP, and serves as EPA's information and management tool."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"The NPL is updated periodically by federal rulemaking.The identification of a site for the NPL is intended primarily to guide the EPA in: Determining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the nature and extent of risks to human health and the environment Identifying what CERCLA-financed remedial actions may be appropriate Notifying the public of sites, the EPA believes warrant further investigation Notifying PRPs that the EPA may initiate CERCLA-financed remedial action.Despite the name, the Superfund trust fund has lacked sufficient funds to clean up even a small number of the sites on the NPL."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"As a result, the EPA typically negotiates consent orders with PRPs to study sites and develop cleanup alternatives, subject to EPA oversight and approval of all such activities. The EPA then issues a Proposed Plans for remedial action for a site on which it takes public comment, after which it makes a cleanup decision in a Record of Decision (ROD). RODs are typically implemented under consent decrees by PRPs or under unilateral orders if consent cannot be reached. If a party fails to comply with such an order, it may be fined up to $37,500 for each day that non-compliance continues."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"A party that spends money to clean up a site may sue other PRPs in a contribution action under the CERCLA. CERCLA liability has generally been judicially established as joint and several among PRPs to the government for cleanup costs (i.e., each PRP is hypothetically responsible for all costs subject to contribution), but CERCLA liability is allocable among PRPs in contribution based on comparative fault. An ""orphan share"" is the share of costs at a Superfund site that is attributable to a PRP that is either unidentifiable or insolvent. The EPA tries to treat all PRPs equitably and fairly."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"Budgetary cuts and constraints can make more equitable treatment of PRPs more difficult. Upon notification of a potentially hazardous waste site, the EPA conducts a Preliminary Assessment/Site Inspection (PA/SI), which involves records reviews, interviews, visual inspections, and limited field sampling. Information from the PA/SI is used by the EPA to develop a Hazard Ranking System (HRS) score to determine the CERCLA status of the site."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"Sites that score high enough to be listed typically proceed to a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS).The RI includes an extensive sampling program and risk assessment that defines the nature and extent of the site contamination and risks. The FS is used to develop and evaluate various remediation alternatives. The preferred alternative is presented in a Proposed Plan for public review and comment, followed by a selected alternative in a ROD. The site then enters into a Remedial Design phase and then the Remedial Action phase. Many sites include long-term monitoring."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"Once the Remedial Action has been completed, reviews are required every five years, whenever hazardous substances are left onsite above levels safe for unrestricted use. The CERCLA information system (CERCLIS) is a database maintained by the EPA and the states that lists sites where releases may have occurred, must be addressed, or have been addressed. CERCLIS consists of three inventories: the CERCLIS Removal Inventory, the CERCLIS Remedial Inventory, and the CERCLIS Enforcement Inventory. The Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation (SITE) program supports development of technologies for assessing and treating waste at Superfund sites."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"The EPA evaluates the technology and provides an assessment of its potential for future use in Superfund remediation actions. The SITE program consists of four related components: the Demonstration Program, the Emerging Technologies Program, the Monitoring and Measurement Technologies Program, and Technology Transfer activities. A reportable quantity (RQ) is the minimum quantity of a hazardous substance which, if released, must be reported."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"A source control action represents the construction or installation and start-up of those actions necessary to prevent the continued release of hazardous substances (primarily from a source on top of or within the ground, or in buildings or other structures) into the environment. A section 104(e) letter is a request by the government for information about a site. It may include general notice to a potentially responsible party that CERCLA-related action may be undertaken at a site for which the recipient may be responsible."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"This section also authorizes the EPA to enter facilities and obtain information relating to PRPs, hazardous substances releases, and liability, and to order access for CERCLA activities. The 104(e) letter information-gathering resembles written interrogatories in civil litigation."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"A section 106 order is a unilateral administrative order issued by EPA to PRP(s) to perform remedial actions at a Superfund site when the EPA determines there may be an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of a hazardous substance from a facility, subject to treble damages and daily fines if the order is not obeyed. A remedial response is a long-term action that stops or substantially reduces a release of a hazardous substance that could affect public health or the environment."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"The term remediation, or cleanup, is sometimes used interchangeably with the terms remedial action, removal action, response action, remedy, or corrective action.A nonbinding allocation of responsibility (NBAR) is a device, established in the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, that allows the EPA to make a nonbinding estimate of the proportional share that each of the various responsible parties at a Superfund site should pay toward the costs of cleanup."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"Relevant and appropriate requirements are those United States federal or state cleanup requirements that, while not ""applicable,"" address problems sufficiently similar to those encountered at the CERCLA site that their use is appropriate. Requirements may be relevant and appropriate if they would be ""applicable"" except for jurisdictional restrictions associated with the requirement. As of December 9, 2021, there were 1,322 sites listed; an additional 447 had been delisted, and 51 new sites have been proposed.Historically about 70 percent of Superfund cleanup activities have been paid for by potentially responsible party (PRPs)."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"When the party either cannot be found or is unable to pay for the cleanup, the Superfund law originally paid for site cleanups through an excise tax on petroleum and chemical manufacturers. The last full fiscal year (FY) in which the Department of the Treasury collected the excise tax was 1995.: 1 At the end of FY 1996, the invested trust fund balance was $6.0 billion. This fund was exhausted by the end of FY 2003."
 History , Reauthorization of excise tax ,"Since that time Superfund sites for which the PRPs could not pay have been paid for from the general fund.: 1, 3 Under the 2021 authorization by Congress, collection of excise taxes from chemical manufacturers will resume in 2022."
 Implementation , Hazard Ranking System ,"The Hazard Ranking System is a scoring system used to evaluate potential relative risks to public health and the environment from releases or threatened releases of hazardous wastes at uncontrolled waste sites. Under the Superfund program, the EPA and state agencies use the HRS to calculate a site score (ranging from 0 to 100) based on the actual or potential release of hazardous substances from a site through air, surface water or groundwater. A score of 28.5 places the site on the National Priorities List, making the site eligible for long-term remedial action (i.e., cleanup) under the Superfund program."
 Implementation , Hazard Ranking System ,"Federal actions to address the disproportionate health and environmental disparities that minority and low-income populations face through Executive Order 12898 required federal agencies to make environmental justice central to their programs and policies. Superfund sites have been shown to impact minority communities the most. Despite legislation specifically designed to ensure equity in Superfund listing, marginalized populations still experience a lesser chance of successful listing and cleanup than areas with higher income levels."
 Implementation , Hazard Ranking System ,"After the executive order had been put in place, there persisted a discrepancy between the demographics of the communities living near toxic waste sites and their listing as Superfund sites, which would otherwise grant them federally funded cleanup projects. Communities with both increased minority and low-income populations were found to have lowered their chances of site listing after the executive order, while on the other hand, increases in income led to greater chances of site listing."
 Implementation , Hazard Ranking System ,"Of the populations living within 1 mile radius of a Superfund site, 44% of those are minorities despite only being around 37% of the nation's population. As of January 2021, more than 9,000 federally subsidized properties, including ones with hundreds of dwellings, were less than a mile from a Superfund site."
 Environmental discrimination , Case studies in African American communities ,"In 1978, residents of the rural black community of Triana, Alabama were found to be contaminated with DDT and PCB, some of whom had the highest levels of DDT ever recorded in human history. The DDT was found in high levels in Indian Creek, which many residents relied on for sustenance fishing. Although this major health threat to residents of Triana was discovered in 1978, the federal government did not act until 5 years later after the mayor of Triana filed a class-action lawsuit in 1980."
 Environmental discrimination , Case studies in African American communities ,"In West Dallas, Texas, a mostly African American and Latino community, a lead smelter poisoned the surrounding neighborhood, elementary school, and day cares for more than five decades. Dallas city officials were informed in 1972 that children in the proximity of the smelter were being exposed to lead contamination. The city sued the lead smelters in 1974, then reduced its lead regulations in 1976. It wasn't until 1981 that the EPA commissioned a study on the lead contamination in this neighborhood and found the same results that had been found a decade earlier."
 Environmental discrimination , Case studies in African American communities ,"In 1983, the surrounding day cares had to close due to the lead exposure while the lead smelter remained operating. It was later revealed that EPA Deputy Administrator John Hernandez had deliberately stalled the cleanup of the lead-contaminated hot spots. It wasn't until 1993 that the site was declared a Superfund site, and at the time it was one of the largest ones. However, it was not until 2004 when the EPA completed the clean-up efforts and eliminated the lead pollutant sources from the site."
 Environmental discrimination , Case studies in African American communities ,"The Afton community of Warren County, North Carolina is one of the most prominent environmental injustice cases and is often pointed to as the roots of the environmental justice movement. PCBs were illegally dumped into the community and then it eventually became a PCB landfill. Community leaders pressed the state for the site to be cleaned up for an entire decade until it was finally detoxified. However, this decontamination did not return the site to its pre-1982 conditions. There has been a call for reparations to the community which has not yet been met."
 Environmental discrimination , Case studies in African American communities ,"Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco, a historically African American community, has faced persistent environmental discrimination due to the poor remediation efforts of the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, a federally declared Superfund site. The negligence of multiple agencies to adequately clean this site has led Bayview residents to be subject to high rates of pollution and has been tied to high rates of cancer, asthma, and overall higher health hazards than other regions of San Francisco."
 Environmental discrimination , Case studies in Native American communities ,"One example is the Church Rock uranium mill spill on the Navajo Nation. It was the largest radioactive spill in the US but received a long delay in government response and cleanup after being placed as a lower priority site. Two sets of five-year cleanup plans have been put in place by US Congress, but contamination from the Church Rock incident has still not been completely cleaned up. Today, uranium contamination from mining during the Cold War era remains throughout the Navajo Nation, posing health risks to the Navajo community. The data in the Superfund Program are available to the public."

Also, while the federal government has reserved funding for cleanup of federal facility sites, this clean-up is going much more slowly. The delay is due to a number of reasons, including EPA's limited ability to require performance, difficulty of dealing with Department of Energy radioactive wastes, and the sheer number of federal facility sites."

 History ,,"The Bluebelt program was initiated in the late 1980s by New York City’s Departments of Environmental Protection and City Planning, based on a suggestion made several decades earlier by Ian McHarg, a landscape architect. Acquisition of land began in 1991 for the project, one of the Northeast United States’ most ambitious stormwater management efforts. The overall goal is to provide the necessary stormwater drainage infrastructure for a 12,000-acre (49 km2) region on the southern end of the island while at the same time preserving the last freshwater wetlands in New York City."
 History ,,"The bluebelt uses a series of carefully placed BMPs at the storm sewer/wetland interface to reduce flooding and improve water quality. Creation of a self-regulating ecosystem that is native to the region is of primary importance to the program. BMPs used in the bluebelt include stormwater wetlands, stream restoration, outlet stilling basins, and sand filters. Ninety-two stormwater wetlands were included as part of the Staten Island project. In order to integrate the wetlands into the natural ecology, the construction process is advised by restoration specialists since general contractors are typically not trained in proper plant selection and installation."
 History ,,"The planting design focuses on quick establishment of the preferred successional communities that will complement the surrounding landscape, before invasive species take over the site. The performance of the Bluebelt during the storms that battered the city in the early 21st century – including Hurricane Sandy – has been described as ""brilliant"".

 Selenium contamination ,,"According to a March 8, 2021 article in The Narwhal, concerns have been raised about selenium pollution leaching from Teck Resources' Elk Valley open pit coal mines' waste rock, which is upstream from the lake system. A September 24, 2020 Montana Department of Environmental Quality presentation to the Board of Environmental Review Meeting, reported that the 95% of the selenium coming into Lake Koocanusa originates from the Elk River—""which has been contaminated by current and historic coal mining in the Elk Valley."" The average selenium levels in Lake Koocanusa were 1 part per billion."
 Selenium contamination ,,"Montana has established new standards for selenium—0.8 parts per billion. Because of the high bioaccumulation of selenium in fish, excessive levels of selenium in an aquatic ecosystem has implications for human health. In the spring of 2020, Teck Resources, had ""reported a dramatic decline in adult westslope cutthroat trout in Elk Valley waterways closest to its mines"". Since 2015, British Columbia and Montana have agreed to adopt aligned standards for selenium levels by 2020. Montana's has been in force since the fall of 2020, but British Columbia has not aligned their standards yet."

 NTSB ,,"The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found a gouge in the pipe, probably caused by excavation equipment years earlier which, in combination with brittle pipe material and excessive operating pressures, most likely led to the rupture. The NTSB also found fault with the use of manual shut-off valves, which were difficult to reach thus preventing operators from promptly cutting off gas that fueled the fire. NTSB cited that the pipeline had a lack of automatic or remotely-controlled shutoff valves. The NTSB also cited Texas Eastern for its failure to adequately monitor excavation activity on its right of way."
 NTSB ,,"In response to the fire, New Jersey passed regulations requiring excavators to call a telephone hotline prior to digging so that pipeline companies can mark the precise locations of their pipes on the dig site. Prior to 1996, the ""one call"" concept had become an accepted national practice. Subsequent to the accident, New Jersey lawmakers continued to call for tougher federal laws on pipeline safety. Following the fire, over 2,000 tenants of Durham Woods and nearby residences sued Texas Eastern and 29 other defendants, including the township, Durham Woods' landlord, and the excavator who cracked the pipeline."
 NTSB ,,"By 1997, over half of these suits had been settled, most for $25,000 or less, but with $585,000 going to Sandra Snyder's estate.

 Overview ,,"Regulated pollutants vary by industry category, with effluent limitations typically expressed as mass loadings or concentrations. The regulations cover pollutants for which there are approved analytical testing methods. EPA has published many methods in its regulations, and has approved the use of other methods published by peer-reviewed sources, such as Standard Methods. Although the effluent limitations are based on the performance of control and treatment technologies (and not the impacts to receiving waters), the regulations do not require discharging facilities to use specific technologies."
 Overview ,,"The facilities may choose any technologies to meet the numerical limitations.In the 1972 CWA Congress specified an initial list of categorical regulations that EPA was required to promulgate. The 1977 CWA amendments provided a list of pollutant and pollutant groups to be considered by the agency in developing regulations. EPA is also required to review and revise regulations as needed, and since 1972 it has promulgated ELGs for 59 industrial categories, with over 450 subcategories. Approximately 40,000 facilities that discharge directly to the nation's waters, 129,000 facilities that discharge to POTWs, and construction sites, are covered by the regulations."
 Overview ,,"The regulations annually prohibit the discharge of 700 billion pounds of pollutants into U.S. surface waters.In the early years of the program (1970s-1980s) the agency published analytical methods for a list of 126 ""priority pollutants,"" consisting of various toxic pollutants. Subsequently the agency has issued methods and regulated pollutants beyond those in the initial priority list.Facilities that directly discharge to ""waters of the United States"" are required to obtain NPDES permits, and effluent guideline requirements are incorporated into these permits. Indirect dischargers (i.e."
 Overview ,,"facilities discharging to POTWs) are subject to effluent guideline requirements called ""Pretreatment Standards."" This table lists the 59 Effluent Guidelines categories published by EPA. EPA periodically publishes a list of ongoing and new regulation projects, and a list of categories that it is considering for regulation, in its ""Effluent Guidelines Program Plan."" Program Plan 15, published in January 2023, announced several regulatory and research projects. According to the agency's ""PFAS Strategic Roadmap"", it is continuing to evaluate options to reduce discharges of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from a variety of industrial sectors."
 Overview ,,"In this regard EPA has decided that changes to the Landfills regulation (40 CFR part 445) are necessary, to address discharges of PFAS from landfill leachate.EPA will conduct research on the Textile Mills category (40 CFR part 410) to learn more about its PFAS usage and discharge characteristics. The agency will study PFAS discharged to POTWs by various industries, including categories that have recently been examined. EPA intends to confirm the origins of PFAS wastewater and assist POTWs in determining whether source-level controls are necessary. The Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations Category (40 CFR part 412) will also be investigated."
 Overview ,,"The POTW influent study will include monitoring of the Electrical and Electronic Components Category (40 CFR part 469) for PFAS discharge data even though EPA is not currently seeking additional action for this category. Additionally, EPA will keep an eye on PFAS use and emissions from airports and the Pulp, Paper, and Paperboard Category (40 CFR part 430).

 History ,,"The landfill accepts trash from New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. It will continue its operation through at least 2023.The site was first created in 1953 and owned by the Tantalo Construction. Tantalo Construction was later purchased and the corporation's name was changed to Seneca Meadows Inc. Seneca Meadows Inc. was later purchased by Canadian company IESI. Seneca Meadows recycles about two million tires a year, making it one of the largest tire recyclers in the country."
 History ,,"The tires are chopped up and the chips used in place of stone for drainage.In 2007, a 181-acre (0.73 km2) expansion was added that was estimated to provide 14 years of landfilling.In 2009, Seneca Meadows opened its Environmental Education Center, a LEED Gold Certified building, which uses geothermal heat. Environmental related courses and labs for area schools are held there by the Audubon Society staff. The building was part of a wetland creation project which the landfill was required to do because natural wetland was taken by the landfill during expansion."
 History ,,"The amount and extensiveness of the wetland created, however, was far beyond the minimum requirement, exceeding 1,000 acres in total.In a pre-election event in 2010, New York State Senate challenger Edward O'Shea questioned his Republican opponent Mike Nozzolio for accepting a $4,000 campaign donation from Seneca Meadows. Nozzolio won re-election.In 2015, a US$3.3 billion, 20-year contract to haul trash to Seneca Meadows from New York City by train moved towards approval. A railyard would be built adjacent the landfill to replace many of the current 50 trucks a day, carrying 1,415 tons, with approximately 30-car trains. Official website"
 History , Company ,"In the 1930s, Barney and Bill Rumpke collected garbage from their neighbors without charge in the neighborhood of Carthage in Cincinnati. Most of the waste was food scraps, which they fed to their hogs on their hog farm. Eventually, officials told them that it was unsanitary, so they stopped feeding the garbage to the pigs although their neighbors wanted them to continue to remove their garbage. Therefore, they sold their hogs and charged money to take the garbage away, creating their trash business."
 History , Company ,"The Rumpke Landfill was started in 1945 and has expanded today to occupy over 230 acres (0.93 km2) of land. As of 2010, Rumpke may still be considered a family operation with over 70 employees being part of the family."
 History , Landslide and fire ,"On March 9, 1996, a massive landslide occurred on the north side of the landfill. The north face of the mound cracked and fell forward, exposing 15 acres (6.1 ha) of buried waste. A few months after the landslide, on May 23, 1996, lightning struck near the location of the landslide, causing a fire that lasted for six days. The crack was filled in and Rumpke paid one million dollars as a fine. Attorney General Betty Montgomery called the incident ""the largest trash landslide in Ohio history""."
 History , Expansion ,"In 2005, Rumpke was permitted to expand Rumpke Sanitary Landfill by 300 acres (120 ha), and it is expected to be below maximum capacity until 2022. Rumpke planned to nearly double the size of the landfill to produce a 785-acre landfill. Local zoning stymied this expansion, so Rumpke sued the township and obtained a ruling in 2010 that the dump was a public utility and therefore not subject to zoning. The township appealed to the Ohio State Supreme Court who, in September 2012, ruled in favor of the township."
 History , Expansion ,The decision states that Rumpke cannot proceed without approval of the Colerain Township Zoning Commission.
 History , Elevated temperatures ,"On August 31, 2009, Rumpke reported elevated temperatures and poor gas quality at some of their methane recovery wells. This increased rate of oxidation has increased citizen complaints of odors in the area. Montauk Energy, Rumpke, Ohio EPA, U.S. EPA, Hamilton County Department of Environmental Services (HCDOES), Hamilton County Public Health (HCPH), and Colerain Township Fire have been involved in trying to resolve the issue."
 History , Miscellany ,"A 14-year-old circus elephant and the world's largest Hershey's bar are some of the items buried in the landfill. Three methane gas recovery facilities, owned by Montauk Energy Capital, operate on the landfill. The first plant opened in 1986, then the second opened in 1995, and the third opened in 2007. These facilities convert the methane gas into natural gas. The plants can recover about 15 million cubic feet per day (420×10^3 m3/d) of landfill gas, making it the largest recovery operation of its kind in the world."
 History , Miscellany ,"Distributed by Duke Energy Corporation, the natural gas energy from the natural gas from the three facilities combined is enough to power 25,000 homes and businesses. Hamilton County Department of Environmental Services (HCDOES), U.S. EPA, and Ohio EPA have been involved in monitoring the air onsite and surrounding the landfill for air pollutants. Levels of hydrogen sulfide, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and methane are included in the measurements. Landfills in the United States Rumpke Sanitary Landfill"

 Lawsuit ,,"In 2016, a Utah advocacy group called Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment filed a civil lawsuit against the Diesel Brothers, alleging they engaged in ""significant, repeated and ongoing violations of federal law"" by modifying vehicles to create black smoke from the exhaust systems, which the group characterizes as ""one of the most toxic types of pollution there is"". The physicians group bought a modified truck from Sparks Motors, and independent testing confirmed that without required emissions features, the truck produced 36 times the pollutants and 21 times the particulate matter compared to a stock truck."
 Lawsuit ,,"In June 2018, after hearing testimony from an emissions inspector based in Davis County, Utah that a Diesel Brothers truck had been illegally modified, a judge issued an injunction prohibiting any similar modifications in the future. Sparks stated he was modifying trucks only for off-road use under the belief it was legal and was working with the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure compliance.In March 2020, three of the Diesel Brothers (Sparks, Keaton Hoskins and Joshua Stuart) and their various companies were fined a total of $850,000 after Federal Judge Robert J."
 Lawsuit ,,"Shelby determined they had violated the Clean Air Act on hundreds of occasions and also had violated the earlier injunction. The fine was less than the maximum possible, as Judge Shelby recognized various mitigating factors.The Diesel Brothers filed an appeal in April 2020, with their attorney arguing the case fell under a split circuit with contradictory Federal rulings."

 International laws and regulations ,,"MARPOL 73/78 (the ""International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships"") is one of the most important treaties regulating pollution from ships. Six Annexes of the Convention cover the various sources of pollution from ships and provide an overarching framework for international objectives. In the U.S., the Convention is implemented through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS). Under the provisions of the Convention, the United States can take direct enforcement action under U.S. laws against foreign-flagged ships when pollution discharge incidents occur within U.S. jurisdiction. When incidents occur outside U.S."
 International laws and regulations ,,"jurisdiction or jurisdiction cannot be determined, the United States refers cases to flag states, in accordance with MARPOL. These procedures require substantial coordination between the Coast Guard, the State Department, and other flag states, and the response rate from flag states has been poor.: 19–21 Different regulations apply to vessels, depending on the individual state. In the United States, several federal agencies have some jurisdiction over ships in U.S. waters, but no one agency is responsible for or coordinates all of the relevant government functions. The U.S."
 International laws and regulations ,,"Coast Guard and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have principal regulatory and standard-setting responsibilities, and the Department of Justice prosecutes violations of federal laws. EPA and the Department of Defense (DOD) began jointly issuing Uniform National Discharge Standards (""UNDS"") for armed forces vessels in 2017.In addition, the Department of State represents the United States at meetings of the IMO and in international treaty negotiations and is responsible for pursuing foreign-flag violations. Other federal agencies have limited roles and responsibilities."
 International laws and regulations ,,"For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, Department of Commerce) works with the Coast Guard and EPA to report on the effects of marine debris. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is responsible for ensuring quarantine inspection and disposal of food-contaminated garbage. In some cases, states and localities have responsibilities as well."

 Federal laws and regulations , Vessels General Permit ,"In 2018 Congress repealed the sVGP under the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act. As of 2023 small vessels are subject to the ballast water requirements of the VGP, Coast Guard regulations, and applicable state and local government requirements."
 Federal laws and regulations , Vessel Incidental Discharge Act ,"The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (VIDA), approved in 2018, requires EPA to develop new performance standards for vessel discharges, and generally requires that the new standards be at least as stringent as the 2013 VGP. On October 26, 2020 EPA published proposed VIDA implementation regulations. Until this proposal is finalized, the existing EPA discharge permits and Coast Guard regulations remain in effect."
 Federal laws and regulations , Sewage ,"Commercial vessels discharging sewage, except fishing vessels, are subject to the VGP or SVGP requirements. Recreational vessels are exempt from the permit requirements, but vessel operators must implement Best Management Practices to control their discharges."
 Federal laws and regulations , Marine sanitation devices ,"Section 312 of the CWA prohibits the dumping of untreated or inadequately treated sewage from vessels into the navigable waters of the United States (defined as within 3 miles (4.8 km) of shore). It is implemented jointly by EPA and the Coast Guard. Under commercial and recreational vessels with installed toilets are required to have marine sanitation devices (MSDs), which are designed to prevent the discharge of untreated sewage. EPA is responsible for developing performance standards for MSDs, and the Coast Guard is responsible for MSD design and operation regulations and for certifying MSD compliance with the EPA rules."
 Federal laws and regulations , Marine sanitation devices ,"MSDs are designed either to hold sewage for shore-based disposal or to treat sewage prior to discharge. The Coast Guard regulations cover three types of MSDs. Large vessels use either Type II or Type III MSDs. In Type II MSDs, the waste is either chemically or biologically treated prior to discharge and must meet limits of no more than 200 fecal coliforms per 100 milliliters and no more than 150 milligrams per liter of suspended solids."
 Federal laws and regulations , Marine sanitation devices ,"Type III MSDs store wastes and do not treat them; the waste is pumped out later and treated in an onshore system or discharged outside U.S. waters. Type I MSDs use chemicals to disinfect the raw sewage prior to discharge and must meet a performance standard for fecal coliform bacteria of not greater than 1,000 per 100 milliliters and no visible floating solids. Type I MSDs are generally only found on recreational vessels or others under 65 feet (20 m) in length."
 Federal laws and regulations , Marine sanitation devices ,"The regulations, which have not been revised since 1976, do not require ship operators to sample, monitor, or report on their effluent discharges. Critics point out a number of deficiencies with this regulatory structure as it affects large vessels. First, the MSD regulations only cover discharges of bacterial contaminants and suspended solids, while the NPDES permit program for other point sources typically regulates many more pollutants such as chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, oil, and grease that may be released by large vessels as well as land-based sources."
 Federal laws and regulations , Marine sanitation devices ,"Second, sources subject to NPDES permits must comply with sampling, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, which do not exist in the MSD rules. In addition, the Coast Guard, responsible for inspecting vessels for compliance with the MSD rules, has been heavily criticized for poor enforcement of Section 312 requirements."
 Federal laws and regulations , Marine sanitation devices ,"In its 2000 report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said that Coast Guard inspectors ""rarely have time during scheduled ship examinations to inspect sewage treatment equipment or filter systems to see if they are working properly and filtering out potentially harmful contaminants."": 34–5 GAO reported that a number of factors limit the ability of Coast Guard inspectors to detect violations of environmental law and rules, including the inspectors' focus on safety, the large size some ships, limited time and staff for inspections, and the lack of an element of surprise concerning inspections."
 Federal laws and regulations , Marine sanitation devices ,"The Coast Guard carries out a wide range of responsibilities that encompass both homeland security (ports, waterways, and coastal security, defense readiness, drug and migrant interdiction) and non-homeland security (search and rescue, marine environmental protection, fisheries enforcement, aids to navigation). Since the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, the Coast Guard has focused more of its resources on homeland security activities. One likely result is that less of the Coast Guard's time and attention are available for vessel inspections for MSD or other environmental compliance.Annex IV of MARPOL was drafted to regulate sewage discharges from vessels."
 Federal laws and regulations , Marine sanitation devices ,"It has entered into force internationally and would apply to ships that are flagged in ratifying countries, but because the United States has not ratified Annex IV, it is not mandatory that ships follow it when in U.S. waters. However, its requirements are minimal, even compared with U.S. rules for MSDs. Annex IV requires that vessels be equipped with a certified sewage treatment system or holding tank, but it prescribes no specific performance standards. Within three miles (5 km) of shore, Annex IV requires that sewage discharges be treated by a certified MSD prior to discharge."
 Federal laws and regulations , Marine sanitation devices ,"Between three and 12 miles (19 km) from shore, sewage discharges must be treated by no less than maceration or chlorination; sewage discharges beyond 12 miles (19 km) from shore are unrestricted. Vessels are permitted to meet alternative, less stringent requirements when they are in the jurisdiction of countries where less stringent requirements apply. In U.S. waters, vessels must comply with the regulations implementing Section 312 of the Clean Water Act."
 Federal laws and regulations , Marine sanitation devices ,"On some ships, especially many of those that travel in Alaskan waters, sewage is treated using Advanced Wastewater Treatment (AWT) systems that generally provide improved screening, treatment, disinfection, and sludge processing as compared with traditional Type II MSDs. AWTs are believed to be very effective in removing pathogens, oxygen demanding substances, suspended solids, oil and grease, and particulate metals from sewage, but only moderately effective in removing dissolved metals and nutrients (ammonia, nitrogen and phosphorus)."
 Federal laws and regulations , No-discharge zones ,"Section 312 has another means of addressing sewage discharges, through establishment of no-discharge zones (NDZs) for vessel sewage. A state may completely prohibit the discharge of both treated and untreated sewage from all vessels with installed toilets into some or all waters over which it has jurisdiction (up to 3 miles (4.8 km) from land). To create a no-discharge zone to protect waters from sewage discharges by vessels, the state must apply to EPA under one of three categories."
 Federal laws and regulations , No-discharge zones ,"NDZ based on the need for greater environmental protection, and the state demonstrates that adequate pumpout facilities for safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available. As of 2017, this category of designation has been used for 72 areas representing part or all of the waters of 26 states, including a number of inland states. NDZ for special waters found to have a particular environmental importance (e.g., to protect environmentally sensitive areas such as shellfish beds or coral reefs); it is not necessary for the state to show pumpout availability."
 Federal laws and regulations , No-discharge zones ,This category of designation has been used twice (state waters within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the Boundary Waters Canoe area of Minnesota). NDZ to prohibit the discharge of sewage into waters that are drinking water intake zones; it is not necessary for the state to show pumpout availability. This category of designation has been used to protect part of the Hudson River in New York.
 Federal laws and regulations , Solid waste ,"Ship discharges of solid waste are governed by two laws. Title I of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) applies to cruise ships and other vessels and makes it illegal to transport garbage from the United States for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters without a permit or to dump any material transported from a location outside the United States into U.S. territorial seas or the contiguous zone (within 12 nautical miles (22 km) from shore) or ocean waters."
 Federal laws and regulations , Solid waste ,"EPA is responsible for issuing permits that regulate the disposal of materials at sea (except for dredged material disposal, for which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible). Beyond waters that are under U.S. jurisdiction, no MPRSA permit is required for a ship to discharge solid waste. The routine discharge of effluent incidental to the propulsion of vessels is explicitly exempted from the definition of dumping in the MPRSA. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) and its regulations, which implement U.S.-ratified provisions of MARPOL, also apply to ships."
 Federal laws and regulations , Solid waste ,"APPS prohibits the discharge of all garbage within 3 nautical miles (5.6 km) of shore, certain types of garbage within 12 nautical miles (22 km) offshore, and plastic anywhere. It applies to all vessels, whether seagoing or not, regardless of flag, operating in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). It is administered by the Coast Guard, which carries out inspection programs to insure the adequacy of port facilities to receive offloaded solid waste."
 Federal laws and regulations , Hazardous waste ,"The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is the primary federal law that governs hazardous waste management through a ""cradle-to-grave"" program that controls hazardous waste from the point of generation until ultimate disposal. The act imposes management requirements on generators, transporters, and persons who treat or dispose of hazardous waste. Under this act, a waste is hazardous if it is ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic, or appears on a list of about 100 industrial process waste streams and more than 500 discarded commercial products and chemicals."
 Federal laws and regulations , Hazardous waste ,"Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities are required to have permits and comply with operating standards and other EPA regulations. The owner or operator of a ship may be a generator and/or a transporter of hazardous waste, and thus subject to RCRA rules. Issues that the ship industry may face relating to RCRA include ensuring that hazardous waste is identified at the point at which it is considered generated; ensuring that parties are properly identified as generators, storers, treaters, or disposers; and determining the applicability of RCRA requirements to each."
 Federal laws and regulations , Hazardous waste ,Hazardous waste generated on board ships is stored onboard until the wastes can be offloaded for recycling or disposal in accordance with RCRA. A range of activities on board cruise generate hazardous wastes and toxic substances that would ordinarily be presumed to be subject to RCRA. Ships are potentially subject to RCRA requirements to the extent that chemicals used for operations such as ship maintenance and passenger services result in the generation of hazardous wastes.
 Federal laws and regulations , Hazardous waste ,"However, it is not entirely clear what regulations apply to the management and disposal of these wastes.30 RCRA rules that cover small-quantity generators (those that generate more than 100 kilograms but less than 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste per month) are less stringent than those for large-quantity generators (generating more than 1,000 kilograms per month), and it is unclear whether ships are classified as large or small generators of hazardous waste."
 Federal laws and regulations , Hazardous waste ,"Moreover, some ship companies argue that they generate less than 100 kilograms per month and therefore should be classified in a third category, as ""conditionally exempt small-quantity generators,"" a categorization that allows for less rigorous requirements for notification, recordkeeping, and the like."
 Federal laws and regulations , Hazardous waste ,"A release of hazardous substances by a vessel could also theoretically trigger coverage under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA; also known as ""Superfund."").In addition to RCRA, hazardous waste discharges from ships are subject to Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of hazardous substances in harmful quantities into or upon the navigable waters of the United States, adjoining shorelines, or into or upon the waters of the contiguous zone."
 Federal laws and regulations , Bilge water ,"Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, applies to ships and prohibits discharge of oil or hazardous substances in harmful quantities into or upon U.S. navigable waters, or into or upon the waters of the contiguous zone, or which may affect natural resources in the U.S. EEZ (extending 200 miles (320 km) offshore). Coast Guard regulations prohibit discharge of oil within 12 miles (19 km) from shore, unless passed through a 15-ppm oil water separator, and unless the discharge does not cause a visible sheen."
 Federal laws and regulations , Bilge water ,"Beyond 12 miles (19 km), oil or oily mixtures can be discharged while a vessel is proceeding en route and if the oil content without dilution is less than 100 ppm. Vessels are required to maintain an Oil Record Book to record disposal of oily residues and discharges overboard or disposal of bilge water. In addition to Section 311 requirements, APPS implements MARPOL Annex I concerning oil pollution. APPS applies to all U.S. flagged ships anywhere in the world and to all foreign flagged vessels operating in the navigable waters of the United States, or while at a port under U.S."
 Federal laws and regulations , Bilge water ,"jurisdiction. To implement APPS, the Coast Guard has promulgated regulations prohibiting the discharge of oil or oily mixtures into the sea within 12 nautical miles (22 km) of the nearest land, except under limited conditions. However, because many ships are foreign registered and because APPS only applies to foreign ships within U.S. navigable waters, the APPS regulations have limited applicability to ship operations."
 Federal laws and regulations , Ballast water discharge limitations ,The VGP sets numeric ballast water discharge limits for large commercial vessels. The limits are expressed as the maximum acceptable concentration of living organisms per cubic meter of ballast water. The Coast Guard worked with EPA in developing the scientific basis and the regulatory requirements in the VGP.
 Federal laws and regulations , Uniform National Discharge Standards for armed forces vessels ,"Congress amended the CWA in 1996 to require development of uniform national discharge standards (""UNDS"") for military vessels. The standards are being developed jointly by EPA and DOD. Initial regulations were published in 1999, to identify and characterize a wide variety of discharge types from ships and boats. A final rule setting specific standards for 11 discharge types was published in 2017. A final rule covering 11 additional discharge categories was published in 2020. The majority of vessels covered belong to the U.S."
 Federal laws and regulations , Uniform National Discharge Standards for armed forces vessels ,"Navy, but the regulations also cover vessels of the Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Army, Military Sealift Command, and Air Force, totalling over 7,000 vessels."
 Federal laws and regulations , Enforcement ,"In April 2021 a ship engineer on the Zao Galaxy, an oil tanker, was convicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for intentionally dumping oily bilge water in February 2019 and submitting false paperwork in an attempt to conceal the crime. The engineer may receive a substantial prison sentence and fine. The ship operator pleaded guilty to violating APPS and was fined $1.65 million US and ordered to ""implement a comprehensive Environmental Compliance Plan.""

 Background ,,"Congress passed the BEACH Act based on the concern for public health and water quality. It was originally known as Beach Bill (H.R. 999) when it was presented to the House of Representatives on March 4, 1999. It was proposed a second time to the House on April 19, 1999 as the Beaches Environmental Assessment, Cleanup, and Health Act of 1999; the BEACH Act was amended and passed through the House on April 22, 1999."
 Background ,,"Numerous changes were made to the draft before being passed through the Senate, including deadlines on publications and studies for the EPA, the clarification of waters covered, the inclusion of territories and Indian Tribes, and implementation of monitoring programs. The Senate passed the act on September 21, 2000 and President Clinton signed the act into law on October 10, 2000.The BEACH Act covers 35 coastal recreational waters near coastal states and territories."
 Background ,,"Supporters of the BEACH Act argue that without the support of environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), Center for Marine Conservation, and American Oceans Campaigns, the BEACH Act would not exist."
 Background , Surfrider Foundation Involvement ,"Members of the Surfrider Foundation and other activists carried a Sign-the-Surfboard petition in support of the BEACH Act through Congress when the act was proposed to President Clinton; they gained over 100 signatures from members of the House of Representatives and Senate. The Surfrider Foundation continues to fight for the implementation and funding of the BEACH Act by emphasizing the importance of public health. Surfrider also has many alliances with other organizations and programs, such as the Clean Ocean Action, Riverkeeper, NRDC, Waterkeeper Alliance, Heal the Bay, and Alliance for the Great Lakes."
 Background , Surfrider Foundation Involvement ,These organizations have been active in supporting federal funding for the BEACH Act grant program.
 Background , Water Quality Criteria ,"Initially, the coastal recreation water quality criteria stated that every state adjacent to coastal recreational waters must submit their pathogen and pathogen indicator criteria no later than 42 months after the enactment of section 303(i) and section 304(a). The revised standards of coastal recreation water quality criteria under section 304(a)(9) states that every state adjacent to coastal recreational waters must submit to the revised water quality criteria of pathogen and pathogen indicators set by the Administrator no later than 36 months after the Administrator's publications. The BEACH Act added numerous amendments to the Clean Water Act."
 Background , Water Quality Criteria ,"For example, section 303(i) requires that states, territories, and tribes along the coasts implement new water quality standards for pathogens and pathogen indicators. The addition of Section 303(i) also authorizes the EPA to regulate states to abide by health standards.Under the addition of Section 104(v) and 304(a), the EPA must perform studies on the effects pathogens and pathogen indicators have on human health, and publish new or revised pathogen indicator criteria based on prior studies."
 Background , Water Quality Criteria ,"Section 303(i)(1)(B) requires that states, territories, or tribes along coastal recreational waters must adopt any new, or revised, EPA water quality standards based on Section 304(a) criteria within three years of publication. Section 502 defines key terms in the BEACH Act."
 Background , Water Quality Criteria ,"For example, coastal recreation waters are defined as ""Great Lakes, marine coastal waters, coastal estuaries designated under the Clean Water Act Section 303[c] by a State for swimming, bathing, surfing, and any other water contact activities,"" and exclude waters, waters upstream of a river, or stream's mouth which have access to the open sea.Section 406 of the Clean Water Act had the largest revisions."
 Background , Water Quality Criteria ,"Under this provision, the EPA is required to: Publish a document containing performance criteria within 18 months from the date of enactment for the following: Monitoring program and assessment of the coastal recreation waters, and water quality standards of the pathogens and pathogen indicators. Process of notifying the public, local government, and federal government on any possibility of water levels exceeding quality standards. The EPA also has authority to award grants to state and local governments for the implementation of their beach monitoring and assessment programs."
 Background , Water Quality Criteria ,"Grant recipients must submit a report to the EPA that outlines their water quality monitoring methodologies, data recorded, and actions taken to notify the public about the water quality standards. Grants for any state or local government are expected to be used for establishing a monitoring and notification program that meets the following EPA criteria: Identifies all coastal recreation waters in the states and territories. Outlines methodologies for implementing the monitoring program. Outlines procedures for detecting the ecological effects of pathogen and pathogen indicator levels."
 Background , Water Quality Criteria ,"Describes how frequent monitoring and assessments should be performed, (factors for this are based on the periods of recreational use of the waters, the nature and extent of use during these periods, the proximity of the water to point sources and nonpoint sources of pollution, and any effects storms have on the water)."
 Background , Water Quality Criteria ,"Communication measures that will be taken to inform the EPA, local government and public of ""the occurrence, nature, location, pollutants involved, and extent of any exceeding of, or likelihood of exceeding, applicable water quality standards for pathogens and pathogen indicators"" Procedures for distributing public notices with information about the safety of coastal recreation waters and if they are not meeting (or are not expected to meet) water quality standards for pathogens and pathogen indicators. Measures to inform the public of the potential health risks of exposure to pathogens and pathogen indicators."
 Background , Water Quality Criteria ,"The grants for the federal programs follow the same guidelines above, except the federal programs aim to protect overall public health and safety and have a deadline of three years from the date of enactment. Establish a public database that provides all available data on pathogen and pathogen indicators in any coastal recreation water. When the BEACH Act became federal law, the federal government had to step in and take responsibility of providing funds to individual states and governments. Congress was provided $30 million for the BEACH Act, but Congress did not use nearly the amount of money for its programs."
 Background , Water Quality Criteria ,"In 2007, Congress funded $9.9 million for water quality monitoring. In 2008, however, funding decreased to $9.75 million. Difficulties within the economy have led to stringent budgets for the BEACH Act funds. There has been a $10 million cut in grants for testing, which has led local governments to fund pollution monitoring activities. The decrease of federal funds caused testing to become less frequent. In 2007, U.S Representatives gathered to discuss the issue of the undercut of funding. They proposed a $60 million fund for water testings at a national pollution level."
 Background , Water Quality Criteria ,"In conjunction to the BEACH Protection Act of 2007, most of the water quality testings may could have been put into play. However, Congress never passed the BEACH Protection Act, leaving beach testings extremely under-funded. In 2015, federal funds of $9.5 million have to be distributed among 35 coastal states. These funds have to protect the lives of 100 million people who are active beach-goers. Beach programs help protect public confidence in pristine beaches, eventually attracting tourists and jobs."
 Funding , The BEACH Act Grant Program ,"Coastal and Great Lake states are eligible for funding if they fall under the requirements of CWA section 406 (b)(2)(A). Eligible ""states"" include the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. In order for tribes to be eligible for grants, they must be nearby coastal recreational waters that are accessible to the public."
 Funding , The BEACH Act Grant Program ,"The tribe must also show that it abides by the ""treatment in the same manner as a state."" Once granted funds, states and tribes must use these funds for programs for comprehensive monitoring or notifying. EPA has set aside approximately $149 million in grants for implementation of beach programs. When allocating grants, EPA considers several factors such as the length of the beach season, shoreline miles, and coastal county population. The EPA wants Great Lakes and coastal states to apply for the 2011 BEACH grant. The first grant allocation was issued on March 31, 2003."
 Funding , The BEACH Act Grant Program ,"To apply for a grant, applicants must report an outline of methodologies, data, and steps taken to notify the public about water quality standards. The state and local government must abide by different steps. These steps include identifying all coastal recreation waters, methodologies implementing programs, outlining steps for how to move forward. Once a state is granted funds for the BEACH Act, they must comply to the EPA Administrator(s) and what they deem appropriate. The Administrator writes up a report that describes two aspects. One, the report must consist of data collected as part of the program for monitoring and notifying."
 Funding , The BEACH Act Grant Program ,"Second, the report must address the actions needed to alert the public when water quality levels exceed national levels. If states do not adopt the water quality criteria of pathogen and pathogen indicators that the Administrator has proposed, the Administrator will immediately propose new, revised regulations that allow state to better meet its standards. Indiana implemented grant funds for the Lake Michigan Beaches Program. The funding increased monitoring of the bacteria, E.coli, at Indiana's Lake Michigan Beaches. The presence of E.coli is potent, because the bacteria symbolizes sewage or waste contamination."
 Funding , The BEACH Act Grant Program ,"To comply with the BEACH Act, the state of Indiana developed a Beach Monitoring and Notification Plan (BMNP). Prior to Indiana's BMNP, Indiana's coastal beaches were overseen once or twice a week. After supplying funds for the BMNP, communities came together to monitor pollution levels five to seven days out of the week. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management also allocated its resources to share the importance of beach monitoring. Beach managers and park departments developed a system of kiosks to inform the public when there are signs of E.coli contamination in recreational waters."
 Funding , The BEACH Act Grant Program ,"Under the BEACH Act, the EPA is required to publish a report every four years that outlines recommendations for water quality improvement, the actions that have been taken to enhance the quality of coastal recreation waters, an evaluation of the efforts taken to implement the BEACH Act at the federal, state, and local level; and the recommendations to improve monitoring systems for coastal recreation waters. To meet this requirement, the EPA created the Beach Advisory and Closing Online Notification (BEACON) system. The BEACON system is a public database that shows the pollution within coastal recreational waters."
 Funding , The BEACH Act Grant Program ,"Recently, it has been upgraded to BEACON 2.0 with a new mapping interface, report creation wizard, and RSS feed generator. The EPA databases are the data sources for the BEACON 2.0 system. Data is gathered from all states, tribes, and territories that receive grants from the BEACH Act. There are four main databases that BEACON 2.0 supplements its information from. The Reach Address Database (RAD) provides geographic data, defining a beaches location and the locations of water monitoring stations. The STOrage and RETrieval (STORET) database and Water Quality Exchange (WQX) provides updated data from the monitoring stations."
 Funding , The BEACH Act Grant Program ,"The PRogram tracking, beach Advisories, Water quality standards, and Nutrients (PRAWN) database provides information on any beach closings or advisories. The BEACH Act jumpstarted numerous water related, health-based movements such as the Beach Protection Act of 2007, Clean Coastal Environment and Public Health Act of 2009, and the EPA's 2012 Recreational Water Quality Criteria. EDC vs. EPA (2003)Following the passing of the BEACH Act, the EPA failed to comply to the provisions made to section 104 and section 304(a) by the specified deadline, and the NRDC sued for inaction."
 Funding , The BEACH Act Grant Program ,"EPA has made promises to update their storm water protections, but they have not acted upon this. The EPA settled to publish a new standard in 2012. EPA Beach Monitoring Program"
 Background ,,"On Cape Cod, small, inland ponds known as Kettle ponds and the surrounding waters of the Atlantic Ocean have become increasingly polluted over the years. The main pollutant considered to be problematic in these waters is nitrogen. The large amount of nitrogen in the water stems from the widespread use of private septic tanks in homes instead of the use of a town-owned sewer. Many towns around Cape Cod opted out of purchasing sewer systems when the federal government subsidized them in the 1960s and 70s to avoid the influx of new homeowners to the communities."
 Background ,,"However, Cape Cod's communities still grew despite the lack of public sewage systems, which resulted in the installation of many septic tanks in new homes.The increased nitrogen levels in the waters of Cape Cod has resulted in greater amounts of algae blooming in the spring and summer months as it is a key nutrient. When the algae die, they leave a thick coat of slime on the bottom of the bays and ponds, which severely reduces the amount of shellfish and crabs able to survive on the seafloor."
 Background ,,"The algae also limit the amount of oxygen available in the water, which kills the fish living there. The algae are also the source of red tides, which have been occurring more frequently with the heightened levels of nitrogen.To counter the problem, towns are trying to institute new programs and procedures to reduce the levels of nitrogen present in the waters of Cape Cod. The common solution that has been brought up is installing new town-wide sewer systems to prevent runoff from septic tanks reaching the waters, since sewer systems release less nitrogen into the environment than private septic tanks."

 Basic information ,,"According to the EPA in a 2007 survey, 10% of California's groundwater has a Nitrogen level greater than 5 mg/L. This equates to around 7% of the population that is drinking contaminated groundwater. Five mg/L is half of the EPA limit of allowed nitrogen in water. There are two primary sources of pollution for nitrogen: agriculture and septic systems. Agriculture can contribute from heavy use of fertilizer as well as animal agriculture waste. Over 68 published and peer-reviewed studies have been conducted since 2002, out of these studies 15 found direct links to groundwater pollution from animals' waste at CAFOs."
 Basic information ,,"Twelve of the studies made indirect links to water pollution and human health while seven found no link at all Due to factory farming practices and the use of nitrogen-rich fertilizers and animals waste in 1994 over 800 wells were closed in southern California, 130 of those well in the San Joaquin Valley. A study conducted in 1996 by the University of California, in which they monitored and surveyed 5 dairies in a high- risk groundwater area, higher levels of nitrates and salts were present under main milking areas, wastewater retention ponds and other land use areas."
 Basic information ,,"According to the Central Valley Dairy Representative Monitoring Program, some practices that are now implemented may not be represented in this data as some provisions of the 2007 General Order was only fully enforced and complete in 2012, when monitoring began. Please See Central Valley groundwater pollution In the United States, there are roughly 450,000 concentrated animal feed operations (CAFO) where cows are held for at least 45 days over a 1-year period, in which a single cow can defecate up to 120 lb of manure a day, which is the equivalent of 20-40 people."
 Basic information ,,"Under the Clean Water Act Section 502(14) a CAFO is considered a point source of pollution. With the federal law on the side of the EPA, EPA has the authority to specifically regulate CAFO's as a polluter. According to the Clean Water Act, CAFO's are considered like other polluting industry in which the business must acquire a permit to pollute and they must have several controls in place."
 Basic information ,,"CAFO's are defined under the EPA as three distinct sizes that are based on the number of animals housed are as follows: ""A Large CAFO confines at least the number of animals described in the table below. A Medium CAFO falls within the size range in the table below and either: • has a manmade ditch or pipe that carries manure or wastewater to surface water; or • the animals come into contact with surface water that passes through the area where they’re confined."
 Basic information ,,"If an operation is found to be a significant contributor of pollutants, the permitting authority may designate a medium-sized facility as a CAFO. A Small CAFO confines fewer than the number of animals listed in the table and has been designated as a CAFO by the permitting authority as a significant contributor of pollutants.

 Overview ,,"The film focuses on the Frank Kaler family of South Brunswick, New Jersey. Kaler is a housepainter and the family gets their water from their own well, as do their neighbors. The Kalers realize that their water is being contaminated from a nearby landfill and seek to get government to acknowledge and fix the problem. Their attempts to contact local and then the state Department of Environmental Protection are rebuffed. Mr. Kaler eventually goes to Washington DC to testify at Congressional hearings. The film follows the five-year radicalization of Kaler as he realizes what is happening to groundwater and why."
 Overview ,,"In a positive review for The Nation, Greg Mitchell wrote ""In Our Water is instructive, and it is depressing, but it is also inspiring"". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote: ""Miss Switzgable's film, in addition to providing a swift and distressing lesson about environmental pollution, ably chronicles the ways in which Mr. Kaler's crusade have strengthened his resolve."" It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. After airing on PBS' Frontline, it was nominated for an Emmy Award. Movie website In Our Water at Frontline In Our Water at IMDb"
 Background ,,"The Kingston Fossil Plant is located on a peninsula at the junction of the Emory River (to the north) and Clinch River (to the south and east), just over 4 miles (6.4 km) upstream from the latter's mouth along the Tennessee River."
 Background ,,"Watts Bar Dam, located along the Tennessee 38 miles (61 km) downstream from the mouth of the Clinch, impounds a reservoir (Watts Bar Lake) that spans a 72-mile (116 km) stretch of the Tennessee (to Fort Loudoun Dam), the lower 23 miles (37 km) of the Clinch (to Melton Hill Dam), and the lower 12 miles (19 km) of the Emory. The plant, originally known as the Kingston Steam Plant, began operations in 1954, primarily to provide electricity to atomic energy installations at nearby Oak Ridge."
 Background ,,"The plant contains nine units with a combined generating capacity of 1,398 megawatts, and burns about 14,000 tonnes (14,000,000 kg) of coal every day. It was the largest coal-fired power plant in the world when it was completed.The plant's ash pond disposal area is located immediately north of the plant along the Emory River shore, and was subdivided into three separate sections, the main ash pond, stilling pond, and dewatering pond, each for the different steps of the disposal process."
 Background ,,"The entire ash pond was impounded by a dike that rose 60 feet (18 m) above the winter level and 741 feet (226 m) above sea level. Fly ash is the fine particulate matter produced by the combustion of coal, which is collected rather than allowing it to escape into the atmosphere. Once this is complete in the wet disposal method, it is mixed with water and pumped into a retaining pond, known as the main ash pond at the Kingston Plant, where the ash gradually settled to the bottom."
 Background ,,"Once the particulate matter settled out, the water was pumped to the stilling pond, where the remaining solids settled, and the ash was dredged and moved to drying cells in the 84-acre (0.34 km2) unlined above-ground dewatering pond, also known as the solid waste containment pond, where the spill took place."
 Background ,,"At the time of the spill, the dredge cells contained a watery slurry of fly ash generated by the burning of finely ground coal at the power plant.TVA had reportedly known about the dangers of using wet storage ponds for coal ash since a 1969 spill in Virginia in which coal ash seeped into the Clinch River and killed large numbers of fish. TVA officials were also confirmed to have been aware of the toxicity of coal ash as early as 1981. In the 1980s, TVA engineers raised concerns about the stability of ash ponds."
 Background ,,"The utility repeatedly found leaks in levees and seepage in the soil at many of their ash ponds, including the ones at Kingston. However, TVA continued to make small repairs instead of switch to dry storage systems in an effort to reduce costs. At the time of the disaster, TVA was using wet storage at six of their 11 coal-fired power plants.Leaks at the Kingston ash ponds had reportedly been taking place since the early 1980s, and local residents said that the spill was not a unique occurrence."
 Background ,,"The 1960s-era pond had been observed leaking and being repaired nearly every year since 2001. The two worst leaks occurred in 2003 and 2006 in which TVA suspended all ash deposits in the ponds to allow the dredge cells to dry out and stabilize. An October 2008 inspection report had identified a small leak in the faulty wall, but the report was not yet complete at the time of the spill."
 Event , Dike breach and spill ,"The spill began sometime between midnight and 1 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on December 22, 2008, when the dike surrounding the ash containment dewatering pond broke. The breach occurred at the northwest corner of the dewatering pond, overlooking the Swan Pond Creek spillway."
 Event , Dike breach and spill ,"The spill consisted of an initial large wave which lasted for approximately one minute, followed by a series of smaller consecutive waves of breaking away and sliding that occurred over a period of approximately one hour.TVA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initially estimated that the spill released 1.7 million cubic yards (1.3 million m³) of sludge, which is gray in color. After an aerial survey, the official estimate was more than tripled to 5.4 million cubic yards (4 million m³) on December 25, 2008."
 Event , Effects ,"The spill covered surrounding land with up to six feet (1.8 m) of sludge. Although the land surrounding the power plant is largely rural rather than residential, the spill caused a mudflow wave of water and ash that covered 12 homes, pushing one entirely off its foundation, rendering three uninhabitable, and caused some damage to 42 residential properties. It also washed out a road, ruptured a major gas line, obstructed a rail line, preventing a train delivering coal from reaching the plant, downed trees, broke a water main, and destroyed power lines."
 Event , Effects ,"Though 22 residences were evacuated, nobody was reported to be injured or in need of hospitalization. However, research shows that the event had significant negative effects on mental health for people affected and in the area. It was the largest industrial spill in United States history, more than three times the size of the Martin County sludge spill of 2000, which spilled 306 million US gallons (1,160,000 m3) of liquid coal waste."
 Event , Effects ,"The 1.1 billion US gallons (4,200,000 m3) of sludge were enough to fill 1,660 Olympic-size swimming pools, and the volume released was about 100 times larger than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill and about 10 times greater than the volume released in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, the largest oil spill in history.The next day, TVA spokesman Gil Francis Jr."
 Event , Effects ,"stated that, at the time of the spill, the area contained about 2.6 million cubic yards (2.2 million m³) of ash, and that two-thirds of that had been released, which would later be found to cover an area of 300 acres (1.2 km2). The New York Times noted that the amount spilled was larger than the amount stated to have been in the pond before the spill, a discrepancy the TVA was unable to explain."
 Event , Effects ,"The spill did not affect the adjacent retaining and stilling ponds; the other two stayed intact, while only the retaining wall for the 84-acre (0.34 km2) solid waste containment area was affected. The spill was reported to have killed and buried multiple deer and at least one dog, and ejected fish from the Emory River onto the river bank as far as 40 feet (12 m) from the shore. The contamination effects in the rivers killed an extremely large number of fish and other marine life."
 Event , Effects ,Large numbers of dead fish were reported as far as the Tennessee River and other area tributaries in the aftermath of the spill.
 Event , Cause ,"Engineering firm AECOM was hired by TVA to investigate the cause of the spill. A report released in June 2009 identified the main cause of the spill as the result of slippage of an unstable layer of fine wet coal ash underneath the pond. The report also identified other factors including the terraced retaining walls on top of the wet ash, which narrowed the area for storing the ash and in turn increased the pressure exerted on the dike by the rising stacks."
 Event , Cause ,"The Kingston Fossil Plant received a total of 6.48 inches (16.46 cm) of rain between December 1 and December 22, plus 1.16 inches (2.95 cm) on November 29 and 30. This rain combined with 12 °F (−11 °C) temperatures were identified by TVA as factors that contributed to the failure of the earthen embankment."
 Response , Response from TVA and government officials ,"The day after the spill, TVA released a statement acknowledging the spill and apologizing for its damage to nearby homes. TVA spokesman Gil Francis Jr. said that the TVA was ""taking steps to stabilize runoff from this incident."" Residents and environmental groups expressed concern that the fly ash slurry could become more dangerous once it dried out. On January 1, 2009, the TVA disseminated a fact sheet stating that the ash is ""not hazardous.""Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen toured the spill site on December 31, 2008. The U.S."
 Response , Response from TVA and government officials ,"Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees the TVA, held a hearing on January 8 to examine the disaster. Environmental activist Erin Brockovich visited the site on January 8, 2009, and spoke with residents affected by the spill."
 Response , Water quality and efforts to stop the spill ,"Immediately after the spill, the EPA and Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) began testing the water quality of the area affected by the spill. Although residents feared water contamination, early tests of water six miles (10 km) upstream of the ash flow showed that the public water supply met drinking water standards. A test of river water near the spill showed elevated levels of lead and thallium, and ""barely detectable"" levels of mercury and arsenic."
 Response , Water quality and efforts to stop the spill ,"On January 1, 2009, the first independent test results, conducted at the Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry laboratories at Appalachian State University, showed significantly elevated levels of toxic metals, including arsenic, copper, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, and thallium in samples of slurry and river water.The day after the spill Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) indicated that barriers would be constructed to stop the ash from reaching the Tennessee River."
 Response , Water quality and efforts to stop the spill ,"By early on December 24, 2008, a flyover by The New York Times did note repair work being done on the nearby railroad, which had been obstructed when 78,000 cubic yards (60,000 m3) of sludge covered tracks. By the afternoon of that day, dump trucks were being used to deposit rock into the Clinch River to prevent the further downstream contamination. The TVA also slowed the river flow, for the same purpose. The slurry that was cleared from Swan Pond Road was brought back to one of the plant's intact containment ponds."
 Response , Water quality and efforts to stop the spill ,"By December 30, 2008, the TVA had announced it was requesting the assistance of the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the ash-filled Emory River to restore navigation."
 Response , Water quality and efforts to stop the spill ,"On January 1, 2009, the TVA announced that rather than attempting to clear away all of the slurry, they would be spraying seed, straw, and mulch on top of much of it to prevent dust scattering and erosion.In response to independent attempts at sampling of the water quality and the taking of photos, the TVA illegally detained, for approximately one hour, two members of the Knoxville-based environmental organization United Mountain Defense who were traversing public land in the area of the spill and warned three other individuals that any attempt to enter the public waterway would lead to prosecution."
 Response , Water quality and efforts to stop the spill ,"On December 26, 2008, TDEC stated that it was satisfied with the water quality in the wake of the spill but that it would continue to examine and deal with the potential for chronic health effects."
 Response , Coal ash issues ,"The spill immediately reignited the debate about the regulation of coal ash. In response to a video that showed dead fish on the Clinch River, which had received runoff from the spill, TVA spokesman Gil Francis Jr. stated ""in terms of toxicity, until an analysis comes in, you can't call it toxic."" He continued by saying that ""it does have some heavy metals within it, but it's not toxic or anything."" Chandra Taylor, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, called this statement irresponsible, and stated that coal fly ash contains concentrated amounts of mercury, arsenic, and benzene."
 Response , Coal ash issues ,"She added, ""These things are naturally occurring, but they concentrate in the burning process and the residual is more toxic than it starts."" Nevertheless, due to pressure exerted in 2000 by utilities, the coal industry, and Clinton administration officials, fly ash is not strictly regulated as a hazardous waste by the EPA.Lisa Evans, an attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice, spoke out against the government, accusing them of lax regulations on the issue."
 Response , Coal ash issues ,"She also blamed the electric power and coal industries for ineffective safeguards, citing other similar cases, and stated the issue of proper disposal of coal ash is not an extremely complicated problem, and that utilities know how to solve it. Thomas J."
 Response , Coal ash issues ,"FitzGerald, the director of the environmental group Kentucky Resources Council and an expert on coal waste, reported that the ash should have been buried in lined landfills to prevent toxins leaching into the soil and groundwater, as recommended in a 2006 EPA report, and stated that he found it hard to believe that the State of Tennessee would have approved the ash disposal sites at the plant as a permanent disposal site."
 Response , Coal ash issues ,"Governor Phil Bredesen acknowledged that TDEC, which regulates coal disposal, may have relied too much on TVA's own inspections and engineering studies about the ash ponds and dredge cells, and promised that there would be an extensive investigation into the cause of the spill in order to prevent similar disasters.Concern was also expressed by environmental groups and local residents that no warnings were issued to residents living in the area about the potential dangers of the site after the spill."
 Response , Coal ash issues ,"On December 27, 2008, TVA issued a list of precautions to residents, but did not provide information about specific levels of toxic materials in the ash, although multiple environmental activists reported that they believed that TVA knew about the contents of the ash, due to the fact that they had tested it prior to the spill. The TVA released an inventory of the plant's byproducts on December 29, 2008; it included arsenic, lead, barium, chromium, and manganese."
 Response , Coal ash issues ,"Because the pond contained decades worth of ash from coal of several different types, it was believed that the area of the spill may have contained isolated patches of higher toxicity.At her Senate confirmation hearing on January 14, 2009, Lisa P. Jackson, then president-elect Barack Obama's choice to head the EPA under his administration, stated her intention to immediately review coal ash disposal sites across the country. Also on January 14, 2009, Nick J. Rahall, a U.S."
 Response , Coal ash issues ,"Representative from West Virginia and the chairman of the United States House Committee on Natural Resources, introduced a bill to regulate coal ash disposal sites across the United States. That year, TVA committed to switching all of the ash storage facilities at their coal fired plants over to dry byproduct methods, which would reduce the chances of another spill. This was completed by 2022 at a cost of $2 billion. At the time of the spill, five TVA-operated plants used this method, while Kingston and another five used a wet process with ponds."
 Response , Regulation development ,"Following the Kingston Fossil Plant spill, the EPA began developing regulations that would apply to all ash ponds in the US. The EPA published a Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) regulation in 2015. The agency continued to classify coal ash as non-hazardous, thereby avoiding strict permitting requirements under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), but with new restrictions: Existing ash ponds that are contaminating groundwater must stop receiving CCR, and close or retrofit with a liner. Existing ash ponds and landfills must comply with structural and location restrictions, where applicable, or close."
 Response , Regulation development ,"A pond no longer receiving CCR is still subject to all regulations unless it is dewatered and covered by 2018. New ponds and landfills must include a geomembrane liner over a layer of compacted soil.Some of the provisions in the 2015 CCR regulation were challenged in litigation, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded certain portions of the regulation to EPA for further rulemaking.The EPA published a final RCRA regulation on August 28, 2020, requiring all unlined ash ponds to retrofit with liners or close by April 11, 2021."
 Response , Regulation development ,"Some facilities may apply to obtain additional time—up to 2028—to find alternatives for managing ash wastes before closing their surface impoundments. EPA published its ""CCR Part B"" rule on November 12, 2020, which allows certain facilities to use an alternative liner, based on a demonstration that human health and the environment will not be affected. These facilities were to submit their demonstration data by November 30, 2021."
 Response , Regulation development ,"The EPA first estimated that the spill would take four to six weeks to clean up; however, Chandra Taylor, the staff attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the cleanup could take months and possibly years. As of June 2009, six months following the spill, only 3% of the spill had been cleaned and was estimated to cost between $675 and $975 million to clean, according to the TVA. TVA hired California-based Jacobs Engineering to clean up the spill. The cleanup was accomplished under guidelines set by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)."
 Response , Regulation development ,"However, the workers were not provided with personal protective equipment necessary to prevent exposure to hazardous chemicals contained within the coal ash. On May 11, 2009, TVA and the EPA announced an order and agreement that documents the relationship between TVA and EPA in managing the clean-up of the Kingston ash spill, further ensuring that TVA would meet all federal and state environmental requirements in restoring affected areas.During the first phase of the cleanup, known as the time-critical phase, over 3.5 million cubic yards were removed within a year of the spill."
 Response , Regulation development ,"This phase allowed the removal of ash from the river to be accelerated by 75% over original expectations. During this phase, the ash was safely transported to a permanent, lined, and leachate collecting facility in Perry County, Alabama called Arrowhead landfill. The Emory River was reopened in late spring 2010. The time-critical phase removed 90% of the ash located in the Emory River. The next phase, which began in August 2010, removed the remaining ash from the Swan Pond Embayment of Watts Bar Reservoir."
 Response , Regulation development ,"About 500,000 cubic yards of material, which mixed with the remains of leaked material from atomic energy production operations at Oak Ridge National Laboratory during the Cold War, was left in the rivers. The final phase of the cleanup consisted of assessments on the health and environmental effects of leaving this ash in the waterways. The cleanup was completed in 2015, and cost approximately $1.134 billion."
 Response , Regulation development ,"In January 2017, the EPA announced that the ecosystems impacted by the spill had returned to conditions prior to the spill.During the cleanup TVA built a new protective levee around the pond, covered the ash pond with a 2 feet (0.61 m) earthquake-proof clay layer, and replanted the areas damaged by the spill. They also purchased 180 properties and 960 acres from landowners affected by the spill, and built a park on the former site of homes damaged by the spill."
 Response , Regulation development ,"They also made more than $43 million in-lieu-of-tax payments to the local governments to compensate for lost property and sales tax revenue. Shortly after the cleanup was complete, TVA began selling off some of the land that they had acquired around the spill. On December 23, 2008, the environmental group Greenpeace asked for a criminal investigation into the incident, focusing on whether the TVA could have prevented the spill. On December 30, 2008, a group of landowners filed suit against the TVA for $165 million in Tennessee state court."
 Response , Regulation development ,"Also on December 30, 2008, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy announced its intention to sue the TVA under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and RCRA. On February 4, 2009, the EPA and TDEC issued a letter to TVA in which the EPA provided notice to TVA that they consider the release to be an unpermitted discharge of a pollutant in violation of the CWA.On August 23, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, representing more than 800 plaintiffs, found TVA liable for the spill. Judge Thomas A."
 Response , Regulation development ,"Varlan, issued an opinion stating that ""TVA is liable for the ultimate failure of North Dike which flowed, in part, from TVA's negligent nondiscretionary conduct."" The ruling ultimately found that TVA did not build the holding ponds according to the initial plan and failed to train its employees on how to properly inspect the dikes surrounding the ash ponds, leading ultimately to a failure to maintain the facility to prevent a rupture of the dikes.Some critics of the EPA's response claim that the choice of how to deal with the spilled coal ash was an act of environmental racism."
 Response , Regulation development ,"Roane County's population is more than 94% White, and the EPA shipped the toxic coal ash 300 miles south to Uniontown, Alabama, which has a population that is more than 90% African American. Robert D. Bullard, a champion for the victims of environmental racism, claimed that the EPA's response was a prioritization of the health of Caucasian Americans over the health of African Americans."
 Response , Regulation development ,"In 2018, the EPA dismissed a complaint by the residents of Uniontown that charged that the landfill was in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.A number of workers suffered health effects in the years following the spill at the cleanup site. As early as 2012, workers began to report illnesses that they believed were caused by the cleanup, and by the ten year anniversary of the event, hundreds of workers had been sickened and more than 30 had died. In 2013, 50 workers and their families filed a lawsuit against contractor Jacobs Engineering."
 Response , Regulation development ,"They were represented by Knoxville lawyer James K. Scott. This lawsuit was dismissed by judge Thomas A. Varlan, chief justice for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee the following year. This ruling was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit after evidence was discovered that Jacobs Engineering had misled the workers about the dangers of coal ash. A federal jury ruled in favor of the workers seeking compensation in November 2018."
 Response , Regulation development ,"The ruling held that Jacobs Engineering had failed to keep the workers safe from environmental hazards, and had misled them about the dangers of coal ash, mainly by claiming that extra protective equipment, such as masks and protective clothing, was unnecessary.Despite the ruling, Jacobs Engineering has maintained that it acted appropriately. Tom Bock, the top Jacobs safety officer on-site, claimed that many of the accusations about the cleanup effort and safety of the workers were false or contained misinformation. An attorney for Jacobs Engineering also claimed that the company had not been found liable for the illnesses contracted by the workers."
 Response , Regulation development ,"TVA has also denied wrongdoing in the case, but in September 2019 a TVA board member was reported to have told a U.S. Senate committee that he would not allow a member of his family to clean up coal ash without a dust mask.In a phase two of the trial, the Kingston clean-up workers will be able to seek damages. In April 2020, 52 workers rejected a $10 million settlement offered by Jacobs Engineering."

 Effect ,,"The intended objective of the Act was a reduction of heavy metals in municipal waste and in streams and ground water that resulted from the disposal of: Mercury in single-use (primary cell) batteries Toxic metal content such as lead from lead-acid batteries and the cadmium in rechargeable batteries, namely Ni-CadsThe sale of the first of these was banned (with the exception of the allowance of up to 25 mg of mercury per button cell) and the second family of products was given specific labeling and disposal requirements."
 Effect ,,"As a result, most retailers who sell rechargeable and other special batteries will take the old ones back for free recycling and safe disposal. The not-for-profit Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation (RBRC), used by most retailers, reclaims the metals within the old batteries to make new products such as batteries (mercury, cadmium, lead) and stainless steel (nickel)."

 History ,,"The Krejci family owned a parcel exceeding 234 acres (95 ha) and opened a junkyard for burning trash and dumping scrap metal in 1940. At some point, the dump began accepting industrial and municipal waste, much of it toxic. This activity continued until 1980, when it closed, but the salvage business operated until 1985."
 History ,,"The property was bisected by the 1972 construction of Interstate 271, which left 42 acres (17 ha) on the north side, and 192 acres (78 ha) on the south side.The Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area was created in 1974, and the National Park Service acquired the Krejci property in 1985, thinking they had an old junkyard. The Krejcis vacated the property, and the following year, a person collecting bottles on the site became ill. Park rangers would complain of headaches, rashes, and odors. The National Park Service requested a thorough analysis of the site's contents from the Environmental Protection Agency."
 History ,,"It was closed to the public in 1986 after toxic chemicals were found at 14 separate locations on 19 acres (7.7 ha) north of I-271 and 28 acres (11 ha) south. Upon investigation and testing of the site between 1986 and 1987, many toxic substances were found at the site, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), arsenic, dioxin, heavy metals, and other carcinogens. Thousands of leaking drums were found on the property. These drums contained waste from industrial processes, including paint, ink, herbicides, pesticides, solvents, and industrial sludge."
 History ,,"Ford Motor Co, General Motors, Federal Metal Co, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M), Chrysler, Kewanee Industries (a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation USA), and Waste Management of Ohio were found to be potentially responsible parties (PRPs) in contributing and transporting toxic waste to the Krejci dump. The PRPs had manufacturing facilities in the general vicinity of the Krejci site; Waste Management of Ohio, who had acquired all of the smaller, local refuse hauling companies, had been held ultimately responsible for transporting the wastes."
 History ,,"All of these companies were sued in 1997 by the US government through CERCLA (Superfund) to recoup the cost of the cleanup, and all of the PRPs agreed to settle out of court with the exception of 3M, who went to trial and lost. The cost of the entire project to the US government is $50 million. However, money recovered through the CERCLA lawsuits resulted in a $21 million judgment against the PRPs. The cleanup project, at a cost of $29 million, was paid for by Ford Motor Co. with help from General Motors."
 History ,,"The lawsuits, combined with Ford and GM covering the cost of the cleanup accounted for the entire cost of the project. In 2001 a National Park Service attorney said that the cleanup was the most expensive in the National Parks system. Cleanup of the site consisted of removal of the drums themselves, along with the rest of the dump's non-hazardous contents. At one point in the cleanup, thousands of multicolored flags covered the former dump's property, identifying multi-increment sub-sample locations."
 History ,,"Since soil had been contaminated by chemicals leaking from drums, dirt had to be removed from depths ranging from 12 inches (30 cm) to 25 feet (7.6 m). In the first 12 months of cleanup alone, 108,000 cubic feet (3,100 m3) of contaminated soil had been trucked out of the site. Most of the non-hazardous soil went to two licensed landfills in Ohio, and the contaminated soil went to a licensed facility outside of Detroit. By August 2012, 371,000 short tons (337,000 t) of contaminated material had been removed from the site."
 History ,,"Because of the extensive contamination, and its on-going identification as the cleanup proceeded, the NPS has made numerous predictions about the end-date for cleanup and remediation of the areas. For example, in July 2011 it was predicted that the Krejci dump site would be in the final stages of revegetation in the spring of 2012."
 History ,,But
 History ,,it
 History ,,wasn't
 History ,,"until August 2012 that the NPS declared ""comprehensive post-excavation soil sampling effort establishes that remediation goals for the 46-acre former dump site have been met,"" and, ""The final steps necessary to restore the Site may now begin, including final grading; re-vegetation using native meadow grasses, forbs and shrubs; and restoration of 3 acres of wetland and wet meadow habitats."" The Ohio Division of Environmental Response and Revitalization (DERR) also had a projected end-date of sometime in 2012.The ultimate goal of the NPS was to have the site appear as it originally would have, with native plants and wetlands covering the area."
 History ,,"""Upon completion of the cleanup, the site will be restored to natural conditions consistent with surrounding Park habitat, and restrictions on public access will be removed.""The most recent update from the NPS is dated February 3, 2015: The remediation of the Krejci Dump Site has benefitted the Park and the public."
 History ,,"This has become a model remediation in the NPS; by taking a contaminated former industrial site, restoring the ecology to its native condition (including three acres of wetland and wet meadow habitats) for unrestricted use by Park visitors, animals and plants alike, and transforming the additional open space that can be used for recreation [n]ear a very urban environment.

 History ,,"Metech History Timeline1875 The Wildberg Brothers facility, (aka Boliden Metech) was a metal reclamation plant which operated in San Francisco between 1907 and 1986. The site was approximately 5 1/2 acres in size. This facility was used as an antimony smelting plant which operated for an unknown duration beginning in 1875. 1907 The Site was purchased in 1907 by the Wildberg Brothers Company who operated a metal reclamation facility. The operations included milling, sampling, assaying of scrap materials, electrolytic deposition of silver, stripping of gold, and copper concentration. Gold, platinum, palladium, silver and copper were recovered as finished products."
 History ,,"1968 RMI traces its origin back to 1968 in Woonsocket, R.I. At that time, Refinemet focused on precious metals and tantalum recovery. Refinemet expanded into electronics recycling by “default” in the late ’70s and early ’80s because customers like AT&T, Burroughs, DEC and IBM had large pieces of equipment that they were retiring. 1980 Wildberg Brothers sold the facility to Refinemet International (RMI) in 1980. RMI primarily used the facility for precious metal scrap processing and refining."
 History ,,"1983 In 1983, shortly after expanding into processing end-of-life electronics, Boliden, a smelting and mining company based in Stockholm, Sweden, purchased RMI and renamed it Boliden Metech. It was during this time that Metech moved the East Coast operation from Woonsocket, RI to Mapleville, RI. Boliden used the San Francisco facility primarily for precious metal scrap processing but did not engage in refining operations at the Site. Operations conducted onsite consisted of material sorting, sampling, and assaying before the materials were containerized for shipment to Boliden facilities overseas for processing."
 History ,,"1986 Boliden discontinued all operations at the San Francisco site in May 1986. All buildings at the site, with the exception of Building 1, the Office Building, Building 2, the Laboratory; and Buildings 11-12, the Melt Shop, and Mechanical Processing area, were demolished and the business was moved to our current location in Gilroy, CA. Trelleborg, (the parent company of Boliden), later spun off the smelting operations under the name Boliden but retained Metech as a recycling and processing operation. In 2002 Viking Investment and Asset Management, based in Johannesburg, South Africa, bought Metech."
 History ,,"2005 In 2005 Metech was acquired by MTI Corp and relocated the corporate offices from Mapleville, RI to Worcester, Mass. The company designed a processing line to include shredders and downstream separation equipment. At this time, Metech also discontinued receiving precious-metals-containing hazardous waste and scaled back its other local precious metals refining businesses that were not adding value to the company’s focus on integrated electronics recycling. 2007 In 2007 Metech was acquired by “Centillion Environment and Recycling Ltd” of Singapore. In 2008 Centillion purchases “Guaranteed Recycling Xperts” (GRX) with locations in Denver, CO, Salt Lake City, UT and Omaha, NE."
 History ,,"2009 2009 Centillion merges Metech and GRX under the Metech Recycling banner. In 2012 Centillion was renamed Metech International 2016 In 2016 the Worcester facility was relocated once more to its current location in nearby Clinton, MA. At this time, corporate operations were permanently transferred to the Gilroy, CA facility. 2018 In 2018 Metech Recycling was purchased from METech International Pte by First America Management Group and taken Private. 2021 The METech Creedmoor location relocates to Roxboro, NC."

 Controversies , Cleanup of the Copper Basin ,"In 1982, the company acquired land in the Copper Basin in Tennessee, formerly the site of the Burra Burra Mine, where copper and sulfur had been mined in the 1800s. In 2016, Occidental agreed to spend $50 million to clean up the Copper Basin and restore the water quality of its creeks."
 Controversies , Love Canal ,"Since the 1920s, several companies and the United States Armed Forces used the Love Canal as a chemical disposal site. In 1942, Occidental predecessor Hooker Chemical Company began disposing of chemical waste at the site and, in 1947, it became the sole owner and user of the land. In 1952, the site was filled to capacity and closed off. The company leased the land to the local school board in 1953. Later in the 1950s, the school board requested that the company sell the land, and threatened to use eminent domain."
 Controversies , Love Canal ,"The school board intended to build a school on an unused area of the dump.A school was built on the site, and later a middle-class residential district was built on land adjacent to the site. The construction broke through the 4-foot (1.2 m) clay seal containing the waste. In 1968, Hooker Chemical was purchased by Occidental. In 1978, residents became concerned about unusual health issues in the region, including high rates of cancer and birth defects.

 Controversies , Oleum spill ,"On Saturday, October 11, 2008, oleum was accidentally spilled at a facility in Petrolia, Pennsylvania which belonged to Indspec, an affiliate of Occidental Chemical Corporation. Oleum is a chemical mixture of sulfuric acid and sulfur trioxide. The accident contaminated the ventilation system and caused a cloud of toxic gas. Over 2,000 residents had to be evacuated for the day. The spill was caused by an auxiliary pump power supply which lacked safety interlocks to prevent tank overfilling."
 Controversies , Colombia ,"From 1992 to 2001, the company tried to drill for oil in the territory of the U'wa people, in northeast Colombia. The locals resisted, concerned about environmental degradation and fears that development would bring strangers and be a target for guerrilla warfare. There also were tribal beliefs that oil is the ""blood of the earth"" and should not be removed. In 2002, after years of shareholder resolutions, legal battles, protests, and a failed test well, the company abandoned the project. Repsol took over the project."
 Controversies , Caño Limón ,"On December 13, 1998, 17 civilians, including 7 children, were killed when the Colombian Air Force (CAF) dropped a cluster bomb in the hamlet of Santo Domingo, Colombia, after AirScan, Occidental's security contractor, misidentified it as a hostile guerrilla target. Groups such as FARC and the National Liberation Army were active in the area. Three employees of AirScan were flying the Skymaster plane from which they provided the Colombian military with the coordinates to drop the bombs. The operation had been planned by the CAF and AirScan at Occidental's complex in Caño Limón."
 Controversies , Caño Limón ,"In April 2003, Luis Alberto Galvis Mujica, a witness and survivor of the accident, sued Occidental. The courts ruled that Occidental was not liable for the incident."
 Controversies , Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum ,"On May 10, 2007, a group of 25 Achuar Peruvians, a group of Indigenous peoples, filed suit against the company, demanding environmental remediation and reparations for environmental degradation allegedly caused by the company between 1971 and 2000, when it drilled in Block 1-AB in Peru. The plaintiffs claimed that the company violated technical standards and environmental law when it dumped a total of 9 billion barrels (1.4×10^9 m3) of toxic oil by-products, such as cadmium, lead, and arsenic, in drainage basins used by the Achuar people to fish, drink, and bathe."
 Controversies , Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum ,"This environmental damage was alleged to have caused premature deaths and birth defects. A 2006 study by the Ministry of Health of Peru, found that all but 2 of the 199 people tested had levels of cadmium in their blood above safe levels.The Achuar were represented by EarthRights International and the law firm Schonbrun DeSimone Seplow Harris & Hoffman LLP.On March 3, 2010, EarthRights International argued to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the case should be litigated in Los Angeles, where the company was headquartered."
 Controversies , Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum ,"The court agreed with a trial in the United States, overturning the decision of the lower courts, and, in 2013, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the company's appeal. In March 2015, the company made a settlement for an undisclosed amount, with the funds to be used for health, education, and nutrition projects in five Achuar communities in the Corrientes River basin."
 Controversies , Anadarko Petroleum ,"In 2019, Occidental Petroleum acquired Anadarko Petroleum, inheriting a significant legacy of environmental infractions including the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history, involvement with the Deepwater Horizon BP disaster and fines under the Clean Water Act.The deal was clinched as investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett pledged $10 billion to finance the deal in exchange for 100,000 shares of cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a value of $100,000 per share. Buffett and Berkshire also received a warrant to purchase up to 80 million more shares at an exercise price of $62.50 a share."

 Controversies , Gore family ,"Former CEO Armand Hammer was a long time friend of former U.S. Senator Albert Gore, Sr. and Gore was a member of the board of directors of the company. In September 1972, after he lost an election for the United States Senate in 1970, Gore became the head of Island Creek Coal Company, an Occidental subsidiary. Much of the company's coal and phosphate production was in Tennessee, the state Gore represented in the Senate, and Gore owned shares in the company."
 Controversies , Gore family ,"The company liquidated its coal assets in 1993 after Hammer died.Former Vice President of the United States Al Gore was criticized by environmentalists when he inherited shares in the company after the death of his father in 1998; however, the shares were immediately sold.In 1998, the U.S. government sold the Elk Hills Oil Field to Occidental for $3.65 billion after an auction process that involved selling the field in segments and offering it to multiple bidders. However, critics cited the Gore family's involvement with the company as evidence of graft."
 Controversies , Safety record ,"In 1999, OxyChem achieved Star Status under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Programs as being among the safest work sites in the U.S."
 Controversies , Piper Alpha ,"On July 6, 1988, the company's Piper Alpha offshore production platform in the North Sea was destroyed when an out of service gas condensate pump was started with its pressure safety valve removed. The subsequent gas leak, explosion and fire resulted in the deaths of 167 workers in what remains the world's deadliest offshore disaster. The subsequent inquiry blamed the accident on inadequate maintenance and safety procedures by Occidental, though no charges were brought."

 Provisions of the Act ,,The 1924 environmental law provided seven codified sections defining territorial jurisdiction for the United States inland navigable waters. 33 U.S.C. § 431 ~ Title of Act 33 U.S.C. § 432 ~ Meaning of terms 33 U.S.C. § 433 ~ Unlawful discharge of oil in navigable waters 33 U.S.C. § 434 ~ Punishment for violation of oil discharge and liability of vessel 33 U.S.C. § 435 ~ Revocation of officers licenses for violations 33 U.S.C. § 436 ~ Administration by harbor and river officers for arrest of offenders and enforcement 33 U.S.C.
 Provisions of the Act ,,§ 437 ~ Act is an addition and not a repeal of existing navigable water laws The Clean Water Restoration Act of 1966 amended the 1924 public law requiring vessel ownerships to recover oil discharges in relationship to the adjoining shorelines and navigable waters of the United States. The 1966 amendment designated the authority of the Act to the U.S. Department of the Interior with a provision allowing enforcement activities by the United States Armed Forces.
 Provisions of the Act ,,"The federal statute was passed by the United States 89th Congressional session and enacted into law by the 36th President of the United States Lyndon Johnson on November 3, 1966.The Oil Pollution Act of 1924 was repealed by the United States 91st Congressional session enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1970. The United States statute was confirmed as a federal law by the 37th President of the United States Richard Nixon on April 3, 1970."
 Provisions of the Act ,,"Inland waterways of the United States Intracoastal Waterway Oil discharge monitoring equipment Oil Pollution Act of 1961 Oil Pollution Act of 1973 Oil Pollution Act of 1990 Refuse Act of 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act ""Automatic Identification System Marine Tracking"". MarineTraffic.com. ""Automatic Identification System Vessel Tracking"". VesselFinder.com."
 Background ,,"Laws governing oil spills in the United States began in 1851 with the Limitation of Liability Act. This statue, in an attempt to protect the shipping industry, stated that vessel owners were liable for incident-related costs up to the post-incident value of their vessel. The shortcomings of this law were revealed in 1967 with the release of over 100,000 tons of crude oil into the English Channel from the Torrey Canyon. Of the $8 million of cleanup-related costs, the owners of the Torrey Canyon were held liable for only $50—the value of the only remaining Torrey Canyon lifeboat."
 Background ,,"In the meantime, the Oil Pollution Act of 1924 had passed, but this statue only limited liability for deliberate discharge of oil into marine waters.Two years following the Torrey Canyon spill, an oil platform eruption in the Santa Barbara Channel made national headlines and thrust oil pollution into the public spot light. As a result, in 1970, Congress placed oil pollution under the authority of the Federal Water Pollution Act (FWPA) of 1965, which later became the Clean Water Act of 1972 and had previously only covered sewage and Industrial discharge. The FWPA set specific liability limitations."
 Background ,,"For example, vessels transporting oil were liable only up to $250,000 or $150 per gross ton. These limitations rarely covered the cost of removal and cleanup, let alone damages.In the decades to follow, several other laws that dealt with oil spill liability and compensation were passed. These statues include: the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act of 1973, the Deep Water Port Act of 1974, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1978, and the Alaska Oil Spill Commission of 1990."
 Background ,,"However, this fragmented collection of federal and state laws provided only limited safeguards against the hazards of oils spills. In 1976, a bill to create a cohesive safe measure for oil pollution was introduced to Congress. Neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate could agree on a single statue and the bill fell out of consideration numerous times.On March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez hit aground in the Prince Williams Sound and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil—the largest marine oil spill in recorded history up to that point."
 Background ,,"Soon afterward, in June 1989, three smaller spills occurred within coastal waters of the United States. This was timely evidence that oil spills were not uncommon.Alaska Governor Steve Cowper authorized the creation of the Alaska Oil Spill Commission in 1989 to examine the causes of the Exxon Valdez oil spill and issue recommendations on potential policy changes. Cowper appointed Walter B. Parker, a longtime transportation consultant and public official, as the chairman of the commission. Under Parker, the Commission issued 52 recommendations for improvements to industry, state, and federal regulations."
 Background ,,"50 of these recommendations were worked into the Oil Pollution Act bill that was introduced into legislation on March 16, 1989 by Walter B. Jones, Sr., a Democratic Party congressman from North Carolina's 1st congressional district. March 16, 1989: the Oil Pollution Act was introduced into the legislative process for enactment. June 21, 1989: a committee reported and recommended that both chambers of Congress should consider the bill further. Only about 1 in 4 bills are reported out of committee. November 9, 1989: the bill was passed by a vote in the House of Representatives."
 Background ,,"November 19, 1989: the bill was passed by the Senate, with revisions. The bill was sent back to the House of Representatives for approval of the changes added by the Senate. However, the House of Representatives did not agree to the revisions. August 2, 1990: a conference committee was created, including members of both the House of Representatives and Senate, in order to resolve differences and propose a final bill for approval. Initially, the Senate agreed to the committee's final proposed report. August 4, 1990: both chambers of Congress had passed the bill in identical form."
 Background ,,"The final step in the legislative process was for the bill to go to the President to either approve and sign or veto it. August 18, 1990: the bill was signed by the President and the Oil Pollution Act was officially enacted. A responsible party under the Oil Pollution Act is one who is found accountable for the discharge or substantial threat of discharge of oil from a vessel or facility into navigable waters, exclusive economic zones, or the shorelines of such covered waters."
 Background ,,"Responsible parties are strictly, jointly, and severally liable for the cost of removing the oil in addition to any damages linked to the discharge. Unlike the liability for removal costs which are uncapped, liability for damages is limited as discussed in further detail below."
 Background ,,"Furthermore, the Oil Pollution Act allows for additional liability enacted by other relevant state laws.Under the Oil Pollution Act, federal, tribal, state, and any other person can recover removal costs from a responsible party so long as such entity has incurred costs from carrying out oil removal activities in accordance with the Clean Water Act National Contingency Plan. Reimbursement claims must first be made to the responsible party."
 Background ,,"If the potentially responsible party refutes liability or fails to distribute the reimbursement within 90 days of the claim, the claimant may file suit in court or bring the claim to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund described below. In some instances, claims for removal cost reimbursement can be initially brought to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund thus sidestepping the responsible party. For example, claimants advised by the EPA, governors of affected states, and American claimants for incidents involving foreign vessels or facilities may initially present their claims to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund."
 Background ,,"When claims for removal cost reimbursement are brought to the fund, the claimant must prove that removal costs were sustained from activities required to avoid or alleviate effects of the incident and that such actions were approved or directed by the federal on-scene coordinator.In a manner similar to that described above, costs for damages can be recovered from a responsible party. However, the Oil Pollution Act only covers certain categories of damages."
 Background ,,"These categories include: natural resource damages, damages to real or personal property, loss of subsistence use, loss of government revenues, loss of profits or impaired earning capacity, damaged public services, and damage assessment costs. Additionally, some categories are recoverable for any person impacted by the incident while others are only recoverable by federal, tribal, and state governments."
 Background ,,"Furthermore, the Oil Pollution Act proscribes limits to liability for damages based on the responsible party, the particular incident, and the type of vessel or facility from which the discharge occurred.The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund is a trust fund managed by the federal government and financed by a per-barrel tax on crude oil produced domestically in the United States and on petroleum products imported to the United States for consumption. The fund was created in 1986, but use of the fund was not authorized until the Oil Pollution Act's passage in 1990."
 Background ,,"The funds may be called upon to cover the cost of federal, tribal, state, and claimant oil spill removal actions and damage assessments as well as unpaid liability and damages claims. No more than one billion dollars may be withdrawn from the fund per spill incident. Over two decades of court cases have demonstrated that obtaining funding from the Oil Pollution Spill Liability Fund can be a difficult task. President Bush acknowledged the changes the world would have to endure when signing the Oil Pollution Act and as a result, he pushed the Senate to quickly ratify the new international protocols."
 Background ,,"The reactions from industries were negative. Industry objected that the Oil Pollution Act would hinder the free flow in the trade of imported oil in the Waters of the United States. Not only does the OPA impose restrictions on trading imported oil overseas, but it also implements the state oil liability and compensation statutes, which they view as further restricting free trade. After OPA was enacted, the shipping industry threatened to boycott the ports of the United States to protest this new industry liability in both federal and state laws."
 Background ,,"In particular, the oil and shipping industries objected to the inconsistency between the OPA and the international, federal and state laws that are impacted. As a result of the OPA enactment, certain insurance companies refused to issue certifications of financial liability under the Oil Pollution Act to avoid potential responsibility and compensation in the case of a disaster.President Bush also predicted that the enactment of the OPA could lead to larger oil shipping companies being replaced by the smaller shipping companies to avoid liability. In particular, smaller companies with limited resources would lack the finances to remediate oil spill disasters."
 Background ,,"Not just the oil industry, but also the vessel owners and operators would be held liable for an oil spill, facing a significant increase in financial responsibility. The OPA's liability increase for vessel owners raised fears and concerns from the vast majority of the shipping industry. Vessel owners objected that additional oil spill penalties imposed by the states are free from OPA limitations of the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851."
 Background ,,"Ultimately, the threat of unlimited liability under the OPA and other state statutes has led countless oil shipping companies to reduce oil trade to and from the ports of the United States.However, there were positive reactions from the oil industries despite the newly enforced codes and regulations. In 1990, the oil industry united to form the Marine Spill Response Corporation (MRSC), a non-profit corporation whose expenses would be compensated by the oil producers and transporters. The major MRSC responsibility was to develop new response plans for oil spills cleanups and for the OPA-required remediation."
 Background ,,"Shipping companies like the Exxon Shipping reacted positively to OPA's efforts to reduce their risk of liability for oil spill disasters. To help ensure OPA compliance, Exxon Shipping compiled all state and federal regulations to which they must abide. Several independent and non-U.S. companies and operators, however, may avoid operations in the United States ports due to the OPA liability. Though the majority of elicited reactions and criticism from the enactment of OPA has been negative, it has nevertheless led to founding and designing safer requirements for ships and global oil trade."
 Background ,,"The Oil Pollution act imposes long term impacts due to the potential for unlimited liability and the statute's that hold insurers to serve as guarantors, which has ultimately resulted in the refusal of insurance companies to issue agreements of financial liability to vessel operators and owners. Thus, the inability to acquire proof of financial liability results in vessels not being able to legally enter waters of the United States. Since OPA does not exempt vessel creditors to enter U.S. waters, there is a disincentive for any lender to finance fleet modernization and or replacement."
 Background ,,"Lastly, OPA has the ability to directly impact the domestic oil production industry due to the rigorous offshore facility provisions. Financial responsibility: The U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for the implementation of the vessel provisions mandated by the Oil Pollutions Act. According to OPA, vessel owners need evidence of financial liability that covers complete responsibility of a disaster if their vessel weighs more than 300 gross tons."
 Background ,,"Vessel owners are required by OPA to apply to the Coast Guard to acquire a ""Certificate of Financial Responsibility"" that serves as proof of their ability to financially responsible for cleanup and damages of an oil spill. In the case of an uncertified vessel entering the waters of the United States, the vessel will have to be forfeited to the United States. This is not a new protocol because vessel owners were always mandated to acquire certificates under the FWPCA 74 and Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA)."
 Background ,,"Since 2011, over 23,000 vessels have obtained the Coast Guard Certificates to allow access to waters of the U.S. Disincentives for fleet replacement and modernization: Since the Oil Pollution Act holds the vessel owners fully liable, it has created a disincentive for oil companies to transport crude oil in their vessels and for charterers to transport their oil on the most suitable vessels. Many financially successful oil companies select the highest quality of ships to transport their products, however, other companies continue to transport their product on the lower quality, older vessels due to the cheaper costs."
 Background ,,"The majority of charterers refuse to pay more for higher grade vessels despite the liability and compensation regulations enforced by OPA. The new and safer double hull tanker vessels are approximately 15-20% more costly to operate. In 1992, approximately 60% of global vessels was at least fifteen years old or older. The major oil companies are still delaying the fleet replacement requirement of retiring single hull vessels mandated by OPA. For example, Exxon and Texaco have delayed the replacement of their single hull vessels for new double-hulled ships. However, companies like Chevron and Mobil have ordered two new double hull tankers."
 Background ,,"Leading by example, other independent shipping companies to invest in new double hull tankers as well. Despite the change from single to double tanker vessels, it is still not sufficient enough to accommodate the needs of the oil industry. It is expected that over the next decade there will be a serious lack of suitable tonnage to meet the expected demand for newer vessels. It is estimated that the global oil industry must invest approximately 200-350 billion dollars to meet global demands for new and environmentally sound vessels. Domestic production: In the Oil Pollution Act, the U.S."
 Background ,,"Coast Guard is in charge of screening the application process for vessels, however, the Department of Interior's Bureau of Ocean energy Management (BOEM) implements and enforces all of the Oil Pollution Act's regulations for offshore oil facilities. Under OPA, the responsible parties are mandated to provide evidence declaring financial responsibility of $150 million for potential liability."
 Background ,,"If a party is unable to provide evidence declaring financial responsibility of $150 million, they will be subject to pay a penalty of $25,000 per day in violation of OPA and may also be subject to judicial decision of terminating all operations.Before the Oil Pollution was enacted, offshore facilities were required to provide evidence that declared financial responsibility of $35 million. After OPA, these offshore facilities had to increase their proof of financial responsibility by 4 times and OPA's requirement of financial responsibility expanded to include facilities in state waters as well."
 Background ,,"Facilities in state waters that are subject to the $150 million requirement includes pipelines, marina fuel docks, tanks, and oil production facilities that are located in, on, or under state coastal waters, and are adjacent to inland channels, lakes, and wetlands. The most evident impact of the enactment of OPA, is on the oil producers within the Gulf of Mexico. Many offshore facilities are located in the Gulf of Mexico and in the marshes and wetlands of Louisiana."
 Background ,,"Major producers are most likely able to meet OPA's requirement of financial responsibility, however, the major oil companies within the Gulf of Mexico have largely withdrawn the operation of their offshore facilities.Due to environmental pressures and the restrictive governmental regulations enforced by OPA, substantial proposals of exploration and production in the United States have been withdrawn. As a result of major companies withdrawing their plans to drill, many smaller, independent producers had entered to make a profit. By October 1993, 93% of all oil and natural gas exploration and drilling were from independents producers."
 Background ,,"Of these new exploration projects, approximately 85% of drilling operations were in the Gulf of Mexico. The independent oil producers generated nearly 40% of the crude oil in the United States and 60% of domestic natural gas. In the case of oil pollution caused by other nations (especially ships), International treaties such as the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage and International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage which have a similar intention as the Act, have not been signed by the United States, as it was deemed the Oil Pollution Act provided sufficient coverage."

 History ,,"NextWorth was founded by David Chen, Andrew Walsh and Scott Richardson while they were students at Babson College. The company was selected for Babson College's 2005 Business Hatcheries program, which provides free resources to student-led startups. NextWorth Inc. began operations the following year. It was originally a service that helped businesses and non-profits prepare luxury items for online auctions in exchange for a 20-33 percent commission. In the spring of 2006, NextWorth changed its business model and services to focus on electronics trade-ins. In January 2007, NextWorth raised $1.5 million in its first round of funding."
 History ,,"NextWorth purchases used electronics and resells about 80-85 percent of them, while the remainder are sent to a network of partners for recycling. Many used iPhones are resold in countries where new ones are more expensive. Sellers can fill out an online form to describe the used products they want to sell, then get a quote through the website. After receiving the quote, sellers have thirty days to ship the product using a pre-paid shipping label provided by NextWorth."
 History ,,"The company wipes the device's memory and inspects the item before sending the seller reimbursement in 3–15 days depending on the payment method. If NextWorth appraises a product at a lower condition than the seller expected, they can get an explanation from NextWorth, challenge the quote, or reject it and get the product back.Sellers can also do trade-ins in-person and get reimbursed immediately at partnered retailers like Target. The Target trade-in program began as a pilot project in 2009, and expanded to 190 locations by 2010 and almost 1,500 stores by 2011."
 History ,,"Their partnership with Target ended in late 2016 when Target selected CExchange as their new partner. A similar partnership was in place with Circuit City before it went out of business in 2009. A company spokesperson stated in 2009 that the company was also partnered with 15 smaller retailers for in-person trade-ins. NextWorth sets its prices through an algorithm developed by MBA students and a professor at Babson College. Sellers can obtain better prices by reselling their electronics directly through services like eBay or Craigslist, but services like NextWorth are more convenient and have predictable pricing."
 History ,,"A CNET editor found most of the trade-in prices at NextWorth to be ""pretty fair"", though he was expecting higher prices for some items."

 Contamination , Early reports ,"From August 1, 1953 through December 31, 1987 (sometimes from January 1, 1950 through December 31, 1985), Marines and personnel of any branch of the armed forces and their families stationed at Camp Lejeune's main base, barracks, family, temporary housing, Tarawa Terrace and Hadnot Point may have consumed or bathed in water contaminated with hazardous toxins at concentrations from 240 to 3400 times levels permitted by safety standards. As a result, at least 850 former residents filed claims for nearly $4 billion from the military."
 Contamination , Early reports ,"The contamination appears to have affected the water from two of the eight water wells on the base. The main chemicals involved were volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as perchloroethylene (PCE), a dry cleaning solvent, and trichloroethylene (TCE), a degreaser; however, more than 70 chemicals have been identified as contaminants at Lejeune. The base's wells were shut off in the mid-1980s, after which the water met federal standards, then they were placed back online in violation of the law."
 Contamination , Early reports ,"The National Research Council of the National Academies released a report based upon a literature review of PCE and TCE in July 2009. The report failed to assess other contaminants, such as benzene and vinyl chloride, and concluded that the water at the base was tainted between 1950 and 1985, but that the contamination could not be linked to any health problems."
 Contamination , Early reports ,"However, on October 22, 2010, a letter from the Director of the government agency tasked to study health effects at Superfund sites, such as Camp Lejeune, illustrated the limitations of the 2009 literature review and advised that there ""was undoubtedly a hazard associated with drinking the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune"".In 1980, the base began testing the water for trihalomethanes in response to new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). That same year, a laboratory from the U.S. Army Environmental Hygiene Agency began finding halogenated hydrocarbons in the water."
 Contamination , Early reports ,"In March 1981, one of the lab's reports, which was delivered to U.S. Marine officials, stated, ""Water is highly contaminated with other chlorinated hydrocarbons (solvents)!""Possible sources of the contamination include solvents from a nearby, off-base dry cleaning company, from on-base units using chemicals to clean military equipment, and leaks from underground fuel storage tanks. In 1982, a private company, Grainger Laboratories, contracted by the USMC to examine the problem provided the base commander with a report showing that the wells supplying water for the base were contaminated with trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene (also known as perchlorethylene)."
 Contamination , Early reports ,"The contractor delivered repeated warnings to base officials, including base chemist Elizabeth Betz, that the water was contaminated. A representative from Grainger, Mike Hargett, stated that he went with Betz in July 1982 to inform an unnamed Marine lieutenant colonel who was deputy director of base utilities about the problems with the water. According to Hargett, the Marine was unwilling to discuss Hargett's concerns. In August 1982, a Grainger chemist, Bruce Babson, sent a letter to the base commander, Marine Major General D. J. Fulham, warning him that the base wells appeared to be poisoned."
 Contamination , Early reports ,"The water from the contaminated wells, however, continued in use at the base.Grainger continued to warn Marine officials of problems with the water in December 1982, March 1983, and September 1983. In a spring 1983 report to the EPA, Lejeune officials stated that there were no environmental problems at the base. In June 1983, North Carolina's water supply agency asked Lejeune officials for Grainger's lab reports on the water testing. Marine officials declined to provide the reports to the state agency. In December 1983 Lejeune officials scaled back the water testing performed by Grainger."
 Contamination , Further reports ,"In July 1984, a different company contracted under the EPA's Superfund review of Lejeune and other sites found benzene in the base's water, along with PCE and TCE. At this point, chemists were testing individual wells. In one case, a well was found to have a dangerously high concentration of a chemical normally found in gasoline, which should have mandated the well's immediate closure. Marine officials shut down one of the contaminated wells in November 1984 and the others in early 1985. The Marines notified North Carolina of the contamination in December 1984."
 Contamination , Further reports ,"At this time the Marines did not disclose that benzene had been discovered in the water and stated to the media that the EPA did not mandate unacceptable levels of PCE and TCE.In 1997 the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) investigated the well water and concluded that cancer derived from exposure to the water was unlikely. According to a federal investigation, ATSDR investigators overlooked evidence of benzene in the water when preparing the report.On April 28, 2009, the ATSDR admitted that the water had been contaminated with benzene and withdrew the 1997 report."
 Contamination , Further reports ,"The benzene most likely occurred as a result of 800,000 gallons of fuel that leaked from the base fuel farm during the years in question. The fuel leaks occurred near the main well that serves Hadnot Point, location of enlisted and officer's quarters and the base hospital. For unknown reasons, the presence of benzene in the water had been omitted from the USMC report submitted for federal health review in 1992, in spite of the USMC being aware of its presence. The report had been prepared by a contractor, Baker Corp."
 Contamination , Further reports ,State officials had also reportedly informed the ATSDR in 1994 about the presence of benzene in the water.
 Responses and actions , Notifications and responses to initial investigations ,"In 1999 the USMC began to notify former base residents that they might have consumed contaminated water. The notifications were directed by a federal health study examining possible birth defects among children born at the base during the contamination years. Up to this point, many families potentially affected by the water contamination attributed rare illnesses and cancers in their families to bad luck.In 2005 the US Department of Justice and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigated the USMC's handling of the issue, and reported that they found no criminal conduct by USMC officials."
 Responses and actions , Notifications and responses to initial investigations ,"In 2007, however, one of the EPA investigators told Congress that he had recommended obstruction of justice charges against some Camp Lejeune officials, but had been overruled by Justice department prosecutors.In 2007, Jerry Ensminger, a retired Marine master sergeant, found a document dated 1981 that described a radioactive dump site near a rifle range at the camp. According to the report, the waste was laced with strontium-90, an isotope known to cause leukemia and other cancers. According to Camp Lejeune's installation restoration program manager, base officials learned in 2004 about the 1981 document."
 Responses and actions , Notifications and responses to initial investigations ,"Ensminger served in the Marine Corps for 24 and a half years, and lived for part of that time at Camp Lejeune. In 1985 his 9-year-old daughter, Janey, died of cancer.An advocacy group called The Few, The Proud, The Forgotten was created to inform possible victims of the contamination at Lejeune. The group's website includes an introduction with some basic information about the contamination at Lejeune, including that many health problems, such as various types of cancer, miscarriages, and birth defects, have been noted in people who drank the contaminated water."
 Responses and actions , Notifications and responses to initial investigations ,"According to their site, numerous base housing areas were affected by the contamination, including Tarawa Terrace, Midway Park, Berkeley Manor, Paradise Point, Hadnot Point, Hospital Point, and Watkins Village and Knox Trailer Park (Frenchman's Point).In 2008, the USMC began a Congressionally required notification campaign to notify former base residents of the issue. An online health registry now contains more than 135,000 names.United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has determined that a former servicemember's cancer was caused by his exposure to the contaminated water."
 Responses and actions , Notifications and responses to initial investigations ,"Paul Buckley, a USMC veteran who was diagnosed with incurable hematological malignancy, was stationed at Camp Lejeune in the 1980s. In March 2010 the VA decided that Buckley's cancer was directly linked to his ingestion of contaminated water at Camp Lejeune and awarded him 100% disability benefits. This is believed to be the first time the government has admitted liability. On February 22, 2012, the VA agreed that retired Marine Frank Rachowicz' terminal cancer was caused by exposure to the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune."
 Responses and actions , Laura Jones ,"On July 6, 2009, Laura Jones filed a suit against the U.S. government over the contaminated water at the base. Jones previously lived at the base where her husband, a Marine, was stationed.The U.S. Navy requested a dismissal of the case, stating that the statute of limitations had expired and that regulations at the time did not include contaminants such as trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, vinyl chloride and benzene. U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle, however, rejected the Navy's arguments and ruled that the suit could go forward."
 Responses and actions , Laura Jones ,"Said Boyle, ""The Department of the Navy's unwillingness to release information regarding contamination at Camp Lejeune or to provide notice to former residents remains relevant in that such conduct limited the information available to potential clients."" Boyle dismissed a claim by the Navy in November 2010 that Jones had violated the 10-year statute of repose. Said Boyle, ""To summarily bar such claims from entering the courthouse would be a profound miscarriage of justice."""
 Responses and actions , Joel Shriberg ,"In January 2011, retired Marine Joel P. Shriberg filed suit against the US Government, claiming that Lejeune's contaminated water caused his breast cancer. Shriberg was stationed at Lejeune from September 1957 through April 1959."
 Responses and actions ," Litigation, 2011–present ","In 2011, 10 lawsuits were consolidated in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Georgia. In October 2014, a federal appeals court rejected the North Carolina legislature's attempt to extend a time limit for filing pollution-related lawsuits. On October 14, 2014, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court ruled that CERCLA did not preempt North Carolina's statutory limits. A multi-district litigation, MDL-2218, was dismissed on North Carolina statute of repose grounds on December 5, 2016, and the appeal to the 11th Circuit failed (Straw, et. al. v. United States, 16-17573). The U.S. Supreme Court refused certiorari."
 Responses and actions ," Litigation, 2011–present ","The Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022, Section 804 of the PACT Act, S. 3373, now provides an extended period for filing. In 2022, as part of the Honoring Our PACT Act, Congress introduced the Camp Lejeune Justice Act. The Camp Lejeune Justice Act would allow those exposed to the contaminated drinking water at the Marine Corps Base to file a Camp Lejeune water contamination lawsuit and recover compensation for their injuries."
 Responses and actions , 2009–2010 ,"In October 2009 North Carolina Congressman Brad Miller announced his intention to add a companion bill to Richard Burr's ""Caring for Camp Lejeune Veterans Act of 2009"" to provide assistance to possible victims of the Lejeune water contamination."
 Responses and actions , 2009–2010 ,"The proposed bills would authorize treatment at a US Veterans Administration facility to any veteran or family member who was based at Camp Lejeune during the time the water was contaminated and suffers from adverse health effects.Miller and Burr's proposed bill, ""Caring for Camp Lejeune Veterans Act of 2011"", was approved by the Veteran's Affairs Committee on 29 June 2011 and was sent to the full House and Senate for approval."
 Responses and actions , 2009–2010 ,The
 Responses and actions , 2009–2010 ,"bill was expected to cost $3.9 billion over 10 years and directed the Department of Defense to pay, and the VA to provide the care, for victims of the water contamination.In February 2010, Senator Richard Burr stated that he would hold the nominations of two top Navy civilian officials- Paul Luis Oostburg Sanz as Navy general counsel and Jackalyne Pfannenstiel as assistant Navy secretary for installations and the environment, until the Navy confirmed that it had funded and initiated programs to study the mortality rate of possible victims of the contamination and a plan to compensate any victims for their injuries."
 Responses and actions , 2009–2010 ,"The Navy notified Burr the week of March 1, 2010, that it had released $8.8 million to fund the requested study and Burr allowed the nominations of Sanz and Pfannenstiel to go forward. The study will be conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).In March 2010 a congressional investigation led by Miller asked the Navy and a contractor, Baker Environmental Inc., for documents related to the contamination issue. Miller also asked for access to the Navy's electronic database of documents related to the contamination, which heretofore had not been made publicly accessible."
 Responses and actions , 2009–2010 ,"""On March 22, 2010, the ATSDR formally complained to the USMC for withholding details of and access to databases containing more than 700,000 electronic documents related to the water contamination. Said ATSDR Deputy Director Thomas Sinks, ""It's interesting that there is information that we continue to discover that we need to go through."" The Navy/USMC responded by providing access to ATSDR to the databases and denied that there was any intent to withhold documents from the investigation, saying that all of the documents had already been provided in hard copy."
 Responses and actions , 2009–2010 ,"Access to the databases, however, was not provided to two panels advising the US Government on the contamination issue, with the USMC saying that the panel members must use the Freedom of Information Act to obtain access to the documents.In September 2010 Miller and the oversight subcommittee of the United States House Committee on Science and Technology held hearings into the contamination."
 Responses and actions , 2009–2010 ,"The committee focused in part on the 1997 ATSDR report and on a booklet the USMC released in July 2010 about the contamination which Miller described as ""more public relations than public health."" Congressional investigators and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry have asked the Marine Corps to retract the booklet, which contains information its critics have called ""misleading""."
 Responses and actions , 2011–present ,"In April 2011, five members of Congress sent the Navy a letter criticizing its continued behavior regarding the issue. They accused the Navy of continuing to mischaracterize the 2009 report by the National Academy of the Sciences' National Research Council, which concluded there was no concrete link between the chemicals trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene and the ailments suffered by veterans and family. The Navy states that the report also assessed benzene exposure, which is false, according to the members' letter."
 Responses and actions , 2011–present ,"In June 2011 the Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry began sending a survey to approximately 350,000 former employees or residents of Camp Lejeune. The purpose of the survey was to determine what diseases may be linked to the water contamination. The agency's report was expected to be completed in 2014.In 2011 a documentary film on the water contamination was produced and released by Wider Film Projects/Tracks Films called Semper Fi: Always Faithful."
 Responses and actions , 2011–present ,"The film, directed by Tony Hardmon and Rachel Libert, made the 15-film short list for consideration for a 2012 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature FilmOn April 20, 2012, members of the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees signed a letter to President Obama asking that health care for Camp Lejeune contamination victims be expedited. Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki responded that providing healthcare to Camp Lejeune veterans was ""premature"". The Government Accountability Office, on May 2, 2012, issued a report recommending that the DoD update its processes for addressing possible health effects from toxic exposure."
 Responses and actions , 2011–present ,"Retired Marine drill instructor Jerry Ensminger started a petition requesting that the US government begin providing healthcare to Camp Lejeune veterans exposed to the toxic water. More than 136,000 people signed the Change.org petition. In February 2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its report on the effects of the water contamination. The report found that Lejeune Marines had about a 10 percent higher risk of dying from any type of cancer compared to the Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton."
 Responses and actions , 2011–present ,"Lejeune Marines had a 35 percent higher risk of kidney cancer, a 42 percent higher risk of liver cancer, a 47 percent higher risk of Hodgkin lymphoma, a 68 percent higher risk of multiple myeloma, and double the risk of ALS."
 Responses and actions , Janey Ensminger Act ,"On July 18, 2012, the US Senate passed the Janey Ensminger Act authorizing medical care to military and family members who had resided at the base between 1957 and 1987 and developed conditions linked to the water contamination. The measure applies to up to 750,000 people. The House approved the bill on July 31, 2012. President Obama signed the bill into law on August 6, 2012.The bill applies to 15 specific ailments believed to be linked to the contamination, The Department of Veterans Affairs is assigned to provide the medical care."

 Responses and actions , Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022 ,"Efforts to create a Camp Lejeune Justice Act were renewed in 2022 and the Camp Lejeune Justice Act became Section 706 of the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act, H.R. 3967. This Act was packaged as S. 3373 with the Camp Lejeune Justice Act and finally passed by a vote of 86–11 on August 2, 2022."
 Responses and actions , Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022 ,"President Biden was scheduled to sign this bill on August 8, 2022, in a White House Rose Garden ceremony.The language of Section 804 provides for monetary relief for those injured by exposure to the Camp Lejeune base and its toxic water by 30 days of ""living"" or ""working"" or ""otherwise"" being exposed between 1953 and 1987 is the prerequisite for compensation. This includes in-utero exposure. There is a jury trial right that is not present in the Federal Tort Claims Act."
 Responses and actions , Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022 ,"Also, there is no requirement to prove negligence, making this what is known in tort law as a strict liability relief. All immunities that were used in the Multi-District Litigation are stripped by this new law, making it much easier for veterans, their family members, and others poisoned and injured to get relief. Many mass tort law firms have begun advertising for Camp Lejeune clients and there are conferences being held on this subject."

 Background ,,"The area was one of the earliest locations in California developed for offshore oil and gas production. Crude oil and natural gas produced by offshore platforms is processed at onshore receiving plants before being transported to distant refineries. The source of the spill was Line 901, a 10.6-mile pipeline (17.1 km) owned by Plains All American Pipeline. The 24-inch buried line (610 mm) was constructed in 1987 along the Gaviota coast to service the crude oil produced by offshore drilling. The pipeline can transport 48,000 barrels (2,000,000 U.S."
 Background ,,"gal; 7,600 m3) a day and the contents are heated to as high as 120 °F (49 °C). Santa Barbara area pipelines are typically not heated but they are insulated to retain the oil's heat during transit. The viscous oil is also blended with natural gas liquids to allow it to flow more readily through the pipeline. Truck transportation of oil was phased out in Santa Barbara County in the 1970s because pipelines were considered a safer option."
 Background , Pipeline corrosion ,"Before the spill, an inspection of the 28-year-old Line 901 pipeline found extensive corrosion problems resulting in thinning pipeline walls. The pipeline did not have an automatic shut-off valve that would have been required on an intrastate pipeline as Line 901 is categorized as an interstate pipeline. Officials from Plains All American Pipeline claimed that installing a new valve would present other potential dangers. The line underwent a comprehensive internal inspection in July 2012 and since then the area where the pipe broke had been repaired at least three times."
 Background , Pipeline corrosion ,Line 903 is a much longer pipeline that transports the oil from Line 901 inland to gathering facilities and refineries. Line 903 was also found to be corroded though not as seriously.
 Background , Offshore oil production ,"Of the seven offshore platforms that used the line, ExxonMobil owns three: Hondo, Harmony and Heritage. After delivering their oil to onshore tanks at its Santa Ynez Unit in Las Flores Canyon, they depended on Line 901 to transport the oil from Las Flores to a pump station in a coastal canyon near Gaviota. The crude oil, known as Las Flores Canyon OCS (Outer Continental Shelf), then flowed into Line 903 as it was transported inland 128 miles (206 km) to gathering facilities in Kern County and on to refineries throughout Southern California."
 Background , Offshore oil production ,"Venoco’s Platform Holly located in the South Ellwood Offshore Oil Field also depended on Lines 901 and 903. The Holly platform is about two miles (3 km) offshore from the Coal Oil Point where about 4,000 U.S. gal (95 bbl; 15 m3) a day comes from natural seeps. Line 903 was also used to move the production from platforms Hidalgo, Harvest and Hermosa of Point Arguello Unit owned by Freeport-McMoRan to the ConocoPhillips refinery in Santa Maria."
 Background , Gaviota Coast ,"The narrow coastal terrace where the spill took place is primarily used for recreation and cattle grazing. Local land use agencies have kept oil processing facilities to a minimum along the lightly populated Gaviota Coast where much of the land is held in agricultural preserves under the Williamson Act and used for avocado and lemon tree orchards. The parks and agricultural areas on this narrow coastal terrace are situated between a rugged coastline and the Santa Ynez Mountains of the Los Padres National Forest. The nearest city is Goleta, about eleven miles (18 km) down the coast."
 Background , Gaviota Coast ,"US 101 and the main coastal railroad line both parallel the coastline and the Hondo and Harmony oil rigs can be easily seen offshore in the Santa Barbara Channel from the highway or railroad.The Gaviota coast with its Mediterranean climate is considered unique for the biodiversity of ocean life. The unusual species found here are the result of the cold water from the north meeting the warm water from the south. The annual migration of about 19,000 Gray whales through the Santa Barbara Channel was in progress at the time of the spill."
 Background , Gaviota Coast ,They may come as close as 100-foot (30 m) from the shoreline.
 Oil spill , Detection and response ,"On May 19, 2015, the pipeline operators in Midland, Texas remotely detected pressure anomalies and shut down Line 901 at 11:30 am. The Santa Barbara County Fire Department initially responded around 11:40 am to a report of a strong smell coming from the area. Fire crews found the crude oil flowing from a drainage culvert that passed under U.S. 101, and into the Pacific Ocean and reported the leak to authorities. Local pipeline workers did not know about the leak until they were notified by the state parks staff around noon that there was oil in the water."
 Oil spill , Detection and response ,"After struggling to find the leaking pipeline, workers located Line 901 where it had leaked and flowed into the storm culvert around 1:30 pm. Clean-up efforts didn't begin for 16 to 18 hours.Company officials in Bakersfield who were responsible for notifying the National Response Center did not do so until 2:56 pm. The Center, staffed by United States Coast Guard officers and marine science technicians, is the sole federal point of contact for reporting all hazardous substances releases and oil spills."
 Oil spill , Detection and response ,"An oil spill triggers mandatory federal notification requirements in a timely manner but company officials said they were unable to contact employees on site as the employees were busy dealing with the immediate demands and distractions of the situation.By the next day, the state parks agency closed Refugio State Beach and El Capitán State Beach. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency. Santa Barbara County also declared a state of emergency. The Santa Barbara emergency management team eventually recommended that the Board of Supervisors keep the proclamation of local emergency intact till until May 2016."
 Oil spill , Detection and response ,They anticipated that a significant winter storm could bring up submerged oil and the situation could be reassessed in the spring.
 Oil spill , Ecologically sensitive area ,"The oil quickly spread along 7 miles (11 km) of the coastline from Arroyo Hondo Creek to the west to El Capitán State Beach on the east. The slick reached four marine protected areas that have ecological or cultural significance: Naples, Kashtayit, Campus Point and Goleta Slough. Culturally significant land and artifacts to the Chumash people are also found in this area.An immediate concern of environmentalists was the potential use of chemical dispersants. To keep big slicks from washing ashore, dispersants can be used to break the oil into small droplets that disperse throughout the water column."
 Oil spill , Ecologically sensitive area ,There are significant concerns about the health effects of the dispersants and the effects on aquatic life. Coast Guard officials overseeing the cleanup indicated that no chemical dispersants were being used but did not immediately rule the use of them out.
 Oil spill , Size of spill and cleanup efforts ,"Plains All American Pipeline stated on May 20, 2015 that at the time of the spill the pipeline was operating at maximum capacity of 84,000 US gallons; 320 cubic metres (2,000 bbl) per hour. They reported on August 14, 2015 that a total of 142,800 U.S. gallons (3,400 barrels; 541 cubic meters) crude oil had leaked from the pipeline.Preliminary reports estimated that 20,000 U.S. gallons (480 bbl; 76 m3) to 21,000 U.S. gallons (500 bbl; 79 m3) of oil was spilled into the ocean through a highway drainage culvert adjacent to the broken pipeline."
 Oil spill , Size of spill and cleanup efforts ,"The amount of oil leaked was later revised to over 105,000 U.S. gallons (2,500 barrels; 400 cubic meters). A Unified Command (ICS) was established consisting of local, state and federal agencies. This included the United States Coast Guard, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, California Department of Fish and Wildlife including the Office of Spill Prevention and Response, and the Santa Barbara Office of Emergency Management together with the responsible party, Plains All American Pipeline."
 Oil spill , Size of spill and cleanup efforts ,"The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ordered the pipeline operator to provide them with the ruptured pipe for metallurgical testing in order to establish the condition of the pipe when it failed. All the oil in the pipeline had to be cleaned out before the section could be removed to determine if corrosion, pressure or a series of failures led to the rupture in the pipeline. Scientists from multiple disciplines at the University of California, Santa Barbara and elsewhere began collaborating immediately after the spill."
 Oil spill , Size of spill and cleanup efforts ,"Based on lessons learned from studies of earlier spills, and using refined computer models, they predicted the spill spread and dispersion, including impacts on Los Angeles area beaches. They used this information to provide guidance to cleanup agencies and to monitor the effects on the ecosystem.Some 3,000 feet (900 m) of floating containment boom had been deployed to contain the oil by the next day. Boats and helicopters identified patches of slick in the ocean so cleanup vessels could mop up the oil."
 Oil spill , Size of spill and cleanup efforts ,"More than a dozen vessels corralling and skimming the oil from the water were working in the days immediately following the spill. Three days after the spill more than 650 workers and 17 boats were cleaning the shoreline, gathering up an oily water mixture from the ocean, and hauling away more than 5,000 cubic yards (3,800 m3) of oil-contaminated soil, sand and vegetation from the coastal bluff. A month after the spill, efforts continued to clean the 8-mile-long (13 km) portion of shoreline that was most heavily damaged."
 Oil spill , Size of spill and cleanup efforts ,"The sandstone cliff face along with large boulders that were splashed by the oil coming out of the culvert were difficult to clean. While sandy beaches farther south were inundated with tar balls, the beaches and rocky shoreline south of the spill had been drenched with a slick of fresh crude oil that had not been in the ocean long enough to be altered into tar balls by the wind and waves."
 Oil spill , Tar balls ,"Days after the spill, tar balls began washing ashore on beaches down the coast in nearby Summerland and then farther down the coast in Ventura county. Although the source of these tar balls could not be immediately confirmed, the pipeline company sent workers to clean them up. Crews cleaned up coin-sized clumps of oil along the Rincon shoreline such as Faria, the beaches in the City of Ventura including San Buenaventura State Beach, and the extensive oceanfront of the Oxnard Plain.Many officials and scientists said at first the tar balls appearance might be a coincidence unrelated to the spill."
 Oil spill , Tar balls ,"Coal Oil Point is very close and well known for the offshore seepage of oil at about 4,000 U.S. gallons (95 barrels) a day. Tar balls continued to show up on beaches farther down the coast in Los Angeles County including Malibu and the South Bay beaches on Santa Monica Bay. When tested, a tar ball recovered in the South Bay at Manhattan Beach matched the chemical signature of the spilled oil."
 Oil spill , Tar balls ,"Cleanup crews responded even farther south to beaches in Orange County.By a month after the spill, 93% of the approximately 100 miles (160 km) of beaches damaged after the spill had been cleaned. The remaining 8 miles (13 km) was the area at the spill site near Refugio State Beach and the rest of the Refugio coastline south of the spill."
 Aftermath , Environmental effect ,"The spill was much smaller than the nearby 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill on January 28, 1969 in which an oil rig blow-out spilled an estimated 3.4 to 4.2 million US gallons (81,000 to 100,000 bbl; 13,000 to 16,000 m3) of crude oil over a ten-day period.The thick crude oil damaged the coats, skin, beaks, and appendages of hundreds of animals. Workers eventually collected 202 dead birds and 99 dead mammals which included at least 46 sea lions and 12 dolphins. The full impact will never be known since animals may travel a distance before succumbing to their injuries."
 Aftermath , Environmental effect ,"Sixty-five live birds and sixty-three live mammals were rescued.Of the 69 animals freed after being cleaned and nursed back to health, 10 were adult Brown pelicans that were released at Goleta Beach after spending three weeks in San Pedro with a team of scientists from the Oiled Wildlife Care Network that is administered by the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. In September 2015, SeaWorld San Diego released the last three sea lions affected by the oil spill at Border Field State Park."
 Aftermath , Environmental effect ,Scientists will monitor the movements of some of the sea lions and at least five of the pelicans with satellite transmitters.The spill cleanup occurred during the nesting season for snowy plovers so special precautions were necessary while cleaning up tar balls. The birds are often found on the beaches along the coast of the Oxnard plain. Their nests are hard to see in the open sand and the birds are easily frightened away by human activity leaving the eggs to fast-moving predators such as sea gulls.
 Aftermath , Environmental effect ,"Least terns were another endangered species of bird that was a concern during the cleanup efforts.Marine researchers note that mammals and birds get the most attention but smaller creatures at the base of the ocean food chain are also harmed by the oil. Life on the sea floor and near the shore such as mussels, barnacles, and other shellfish are unable to move out of the way. When exposed to oil, these organisms suffer 90%-plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades."
 Aftermath , Environmental effect ,"Researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara began collecting samples within hours of the spill to monitor the impact on the marine environment. Researchers and volunteers returned to the area many times to collect additional samples. Since students and researchers had previously used this area for study purposes, baseline data was available. David Valentine, a professor in the university's Department of Earth Science said, “The discharge of heavy oil at Refugio presents a unique opportunity to discover novel metabolic, genomic and ecological feedbacks among marine microbial communities, heavy oil and ecosystem response."
 Aftermath , Environmental effect ,We have the opportunity to study ecosystem changes and microbial reactions from the very early stages through an entire year. It’s really rare for scientists to get day zero access to any sort of event like this.”
 Aftermath , Economic impact ,"Plains All American Pipeline estimated that the cleanup had cost $96 million during a joint oversight hearing of the State Assembly Natural Resources Committee and Senate Select Committee on June 26, 2015. Overall expenses related to the spill were estimated to be $257 million in an earnings report for Plains All American Pipeline issued around the same time. This included the emergency response and cleanup efforts along with the expected legal claims and potential settlements."
 Aftermath , Economic impact ,The CEO stated in the report that all but $65 million would be covered by insurance and that the figure did not include lost revenue from the pipelines that have been shut down. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires whoever spills the oil to pay for the cleanup.The economic consequences for the county were more difficult to quantify. The financial impact on the county was estimated by the California Economic Forecast Director at $74 million if Line 901 remains dormant for three years because of the dependence of the region's oil and gas industry to move product through this line.
 Aftermath , Economic impact ,"Workers' income, property taxes, and federal royalties are reduced while the line is out of service. The impact on tourism was not as bad as predicted and thousands of workers involved in the cleanup appear to have benefited some hotels.In response to the spill, 138 square miles (360 km2) of fisheries were closed. The order was lifted after six weeks when the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment determined that the area's seafood was safe to eat and posed “no significant health threat.” The closure impacted commercial fishermen and fishing charters."
 Aftermath , Economic impact ,Local commercial fishermen reported that it was tough to sell the fish caught outside of the closed area because of the impression that all of the region's seafood was tainted from the oil spill. There is also a long term concern that the oil may have wiped out the main food source for some sea life in the area. The predominant products from the Santa Barbara region are red sea urchin and red rock crab with an average of $11 million in sales revenue per year
 Aftermath , Recreation impacts ,"Although lightly populated, recreation brings outdoor enthusiasts to the Gaviota Coast. The spill affected visitors to both public and private facilities in the area. The state closed heavily used El Capitán State Beach for a month, which was finally reopened on June 26 for camping and day use. Refugio State Beach was more heavily damaged and did not reopen until July 17, 2015. These two popular parks quickly filled up with summer crowds when they reopened. Eric Hjelstrom, California State Parks sector superintendent said, “We were booked full the day we opened."
 Aftermath , Recreation impacts ,"Half of the people didn’t know we had been closed, which is a good testament to how clean the park was.”"
 Aftermath , Litigation ,"Almost a year after the spill, the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury handed down 46 criminal indictments against Plains. The Santa Barbara County District Attorney also announced a misdemeanor count against one of the company's employees. California state Attorney General Kamala Harris, who had also opened a criminal investigation right after spill, said this prosecution will send a message to Plains and to the oil and gas industry in California.The profound economic impacts on local fishermen, who couldn't fish during the fishery closures, led to the filing of several lawsuits."
 Aftermath , Litigation ,"These suits, along with those by homeowners who are alleging losses in property value, were consolidated into a class-action lawsuit against Plains. An additional class-action suit was filed by stockholders claiming Plains provided “false and misleading statements” regarding pipeline maintenance and monitoring.Plains All American Pipeline was ordered in March 2016 to stop misleading claimants who sought interim damages. A U.S."
 Aftermath , Litigation ,"District Court issued an order that stated that Plains was misleading ""victims towards unwittingly waiving their rights to full recovery"" through the class-action lawsuit where they could obtain further compensation.The city of Santa Barbara filed a lawsuit in May 2016 seeking $2.1 million in compensation from Plains. The media coverage of the spill had created the perception that the oil spill was in the city of Santa Barbara rather than 20 miles (32 km) away in Santa Barbara County according to the city officials."
 Aftermath , Litigation ,"This discouraged visitors during the peak tourism season, losing the city millions of dollars in tax revenue.The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration was requested to provide all records regarding the internal inspection of Line 901 conducted in 2012 and details of all other inspections since 2013 such as maintenance data, monitoring information, incident reports and repair logs."
 Aftermath , Litigation ,"The Environmental Defense Center of Santa Barbara (EDC), who had requested the release of the records along with the Santa Barbara Channelkeepers, filed a lawsuit against the agency in December 2015 since it had been over six months and they had not received any of the requested documents.After a jury found that their negligent practices contributed to the spill, Plains agreed in March 2020 to pay $60 million for penalties and damages."
 Aftermath , Litigation ,"While admitting no guilt for their role leading up to the spill, the settlement by the Plains All American Pipeline Company included a consent decree with a multitude of federal regulatory and environmental agencies which includes various conditions."
 Aftermath , Oil and gas industry ,"The estimate of $74 million financial impact over three years to the county includes approximately $37 million in lost property taxes, $32 million in lessened worker income and $5 million in reduced federal royalties. This is the result of the region's oil and gas industry being heavily dependent on Lines 901 and 903. Prior to the spill, ExxonMobil, which was the region's biggest oil operator at the time, was on pace to generate approximately $636 million in revenue in Santa Barbara County during 2015 but as of November 5, 2015 had only generated an estimated $216.6 million."
 Aftermath , Oil and gas industry ,"The seven offshore oil platforms that rely on the lines were forced to shut down when onshore storage tanks were filled. With the bankruptcy of Veneco, the state is looking at spending $58 million to begin dismantling Platform Holly. Truck transport of continuing production from the offshore platforms was not allowed by local agencies. Exceptions have been closely scrutinized by local officials such as allowing Venoco in August 2015 to transport crude oil that was already onshore by truck for a limited period."
 Aftermath , Oil and gas industry ,"The oil had been evacuated from tanks and pipelines to allow maintenance of the onshore Ellwood facility in Goleta that serves Platform Holly.On August 15, 2017, Plains submitted an application to the Energy and Minerals Division of Santa Barbara County Planning and Development for the replacement of Lines 901 and 903. The replacement pipeline would restore crude oil pipeline transportation service in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Kern Counties as the old pipelines can not be used.ExxonMobil finished the environmental impact report in 2020 of a plan to truck oil."
 Aftermath , Oil and gas industry ,"Phillips 66 Santa Barbara County refinery was the primary destination for the trucked oil but after the release of the report it was announced that it would be closing. The Planning Commission of Santa Barbara County rejected the proposal for 78 additional truck trips a day over the steep, narrow, and winding Highway 166 to the Pentland processing plant in the San Joaquin Valley. Being unable to restart production, ExxonMobil decided in 2022 to sell the poor performing business assets consisting of the three platforms, a pipeline and the Santa Ynez Unit in Las Flores Canyon."
 Aftermath , Legislation ,"Three bills were signed into law in response to the spill. Under a new law, the California Fire Marshal will be required to review the oil pipelines conditions every year while federal regulations only mandate a review every five years. Another new law provides for making oil spill response times faster and more effective. Finally, a new law will force intrastate pipelines to use the best-known technology such as automatic shut-off valves. Another bill was signed into law in 2020 by Governor Gavin Newsom that increased the state’s oil spill penalties for the first time in 30 years."
 Aftermath , Regulations ,"The Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) is responsible for developing and enforcing regulations for pipeline operation transportation having been created in 2004 within the United States Department of Transportation. In the months following the spill, they found that the in-line inspection tool used by Plains in Line 901 and Line 903 had miscalculated the degree of corrosion. The company also withheld in-line inspection data so “it could enhance its interpretation of the data,” according to a corrective order issued by PHMSA. In October, PHMSA proposed new rules to assist in preventing such inspection discrepancies."

 Implementation history ,,The Army Corps of Engineers administered the Act and initially focused on controlling debris that obstructed navigation.: 3
 Implementation history , Pollution control litigation in the 1960s ,"In the 1960s, due to increasing public and governmental concern about water pollution, the federal government began to use the Act to control pollution. The government pursued court cases to prosecute dischargers of industrial waste to waterways. Notable cases include United States v. Republic Steel Corp. (1960) and U.S. v. Standard Oil Co. (1966)."
 Implementation history , 1970 Discharge permit program ,"Congress had enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) in 1948 to address water pollution problems, but this law gave the government limited enforcement authority. The Department of Interior, which administered the FWPCA (prior to 1972), developed a policy with the Department of Justice and the Army Corps of Engineers to use the Refuse Act as an enforcement tool, to complement the FWPCA. In 1970 President Richard Nixon issued an Executive Order creating a new permit program under the Refuse Act."
 Implementation history , 1970 Discharge permit program ,"The focus of the new permit program was on industrial pollution.: 3–6 The Corps of Engineers began to issue the new discharge permits, but in 1971 a legal challenge halted the program. Congress enacted major amendments to the FWPCA in 1972. (See Clean Water Act.) Included in the legislation was a new discharge permit program, called the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), which replaced the Refuse Act permit program. The amendments assigned lead responsibility for implementation of NPDES to the newly formed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Congress did not repeal the Refuse Act."
 Implementation history , 1970 Discharge permit program ,"The law is still used by the Corps of Engineers to prevent obstructions to navigation. In some pollution enforcement cases, the federal government has used it as a supplemental authority along with the FWPCA."
 History , Early years ,"In 1922, two former Tufts University School of Engineering, roommates Laurence K. Marshall and Vannevar Bush, along with scientist Charles G. Smith, founded the American Appliance Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Its focus, which was originally on new refrigeration technology, soon shifted to electronics. The company's first product was a gaseous (helium) voltage-regulator tube that was based on Charles Smith's earlier astronomical research of the star Zeta Puppis."
 History , Early years ,"The electron tube was christened with the name Raytheon (a compound of Old French and Greek meaning 'light from the gods') and was used in a battery eliminator, a type of radio-receiver power supply that plugged into the power grid in place of large batteries. This made it possible to convert household alternating current to a regulated, high voltage direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive, short-lived batteries. In 1925, the company changed its name to Raytheon Manufacturing Company and began marketing its rectifier, under the Raytheon brand name, with commercial success."
 History , Early years ,"In 1928 Raytheon merged with Q.R.S. Company, an American manufacturer of electron tubes and switches, to form the successor of the same name, Raytheon Manufacturing Company. By the 1930s, it had already grown to become one of the world's largest vacuum tube manufacturing companies. In 1933 it diversified by acquiring Acme-Delta Company, a producer of transformers, power equipment, and electronic auto parts."
 History , During World War II ,"Early in World War II, physicists in the United Kingdom invented the magnetron, a specialized microwave-generating electron tube that markedly improved the capability of radar to detect enemy aircraft. American companies were then sought by the US government to perfect and mass-produce the magnetron for ground-based, airborne, and shipborne radar systems, and, with support from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Radiation Laboratory (recently formed to investigate microwave radar), Raytheon received a contract to build the devices."
 History , During World War II ,"Within a few months of being awarded the contract, Raytheon had already begun to mass manufacture magnetron tubes for use in radar sets and then complete radar systems. At war's end in 1945 the company was responsible for about 80 percent of all magnetrons manufactured. During the war Raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems, particularly for submarine detection. Raytheon ranked 71st among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.Raytheon's research on the magnetron tube revealed the potential of microwaves to cook food."
 History , During World War II ,"In 1945, Raytheon's Percy Spencer invented the microwave oven by discovering that the magnetron could rapidly heat food. In 1947, the company demonstrated the Radarange microwave oven for commercial use.Raytheon was also a contractor for the mass-production of the newly invented miniature shock-resistant vacuum tubes used in proximity fuses. These tubes were difficult to manufacture and required rigorous attention to detail to avoid failure of the fuse."
 History , After World War II ,"In 1946, the company expanded its electronics capability through acquisitions that included the Submarine Signal Company (founded in 1901), a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment. With its broadened capabilities, Raytheon developed the first guidance system for a missile that could intercept a flying target. In 1948 Charles Francis Adams IV was appointed to be the new President of the company and served until 1960. In 1948, Raytheon began to manufacture guided missiles. In 1950, its Lark missile became the first such weapon to destroy a target aircraft in flight."
 History , After World War II ,"Raytheon then received military contracts to develop the air-to-air Sparrow and ground-to-air Hawk missiles, projects that received impetus from the Korean War. In later decades, it remained a major producer of missiles, such as the Patriot antimissile missile and the air-to-air Phoenix missile. Raytheon made a foray into computers, producing the RAYDAC computer for the U.S.Navy which became operational in 1953. ""Unfortunately, the machine was technically obsolete by the time it was operational."" Also in 1953 the company began work on a follow-on, the RAYCOM, which was never completed."
 History , After World War II ,"In 1954 it entered into a joint venture with Honeywell to form the Datamatic corporation. However it sold its interest to Honeywell a year later, before introduction of the DATAmatic 1000 system. In 1958, Raytheon acquired the marine electronics company Applied Electronics Company, which significantly increased its strength in commercial marine navigation and radio gear, as well as less-expensive Japanese suppliers of products such as marine/weather band radios and direction-finding gear. In the same year, it changed its name to Raytheon Company."
 History , After World War II ,"During the post-war years, Raytheon also made generally low- to medium-powered radio and television transmitters and related equipment for the commercial market, but the high-powered market was solidly in the hands of larger, better-financed competitors such as Continental Electronics, General Electric and Radio Corporation of America. In the 1950s, Raytheon began manufacturing transistors, including the CK722, priced and marketed to hobbyists. In 1961, the British electronics company A.C. Cossor merged with Raytheon, following its sale by Philips. The new Company's name was Raytheon Cossor. The Cossor side of the organisation is still current in the Raytheon group as of 2010."
 History , After World War II ,"In 1965, it acquired Amana Refrigeration, Inc., a manufacturer of refrigerators and air conditioners. Using the Amana brand name and its distribution channels, Raytheon began selling the first countertop household microwave oven in 1967 and became a dominant manufacturer in the microwave oven business. In 1966, the company entered the educational publishing business with the acquisition of D.C. Heath and Company, marketing an influential physics textbook developed by the Physical Science Study Committee. Raytheon also manufactured the Apollo Guidance Computer, which was introduced that year and flew aboard all NASA Project Apollo missions."
 History , After World War II ,"In the late 1970s, Raytheon acquired McGraw-Edison's appliances division notable for the Speed Queen line of washers and dryers."
 History , 1980s ,"In 1980, Raytheon acquired Beech Aircraft Corporation, a leading manufacturer of general aviation aircraft founded in 1932 by Walter H. Beech. In 1993 the company expanded its aircraft activities by adding the Hawker line of business jets by acquiring Corporate Jets Inc., the business jet product line of British Aerospace (now BAE Systems). These two entities were merged in 1994 to become the Raytheon Aircraft Company. In the first quarter of 2007 Raytheon sold its aircraft operations, which subsequently operated as Hawker Beechcraft, and since 2014 have been units of Textron Aviation."
 History , 1980s ,"The product line of Raytheon's aircraft subsidiary included business jets such as the Hawker 800XP and Hawker 4000, the Beechjet 400A, and the Premier I; the popular King Air series of twin turboprops; and piston-engine aircraft such as the Bonanza. Its special-mission aircraft included the single-turboprop T-6A Texan II, which the United States Air Force and United States Navy had chosen as their primary training aircraft."
 History , 1990s ,"In 1991, during the Persian Gulf War, Raytheon's Patriot missile received great international exposure, resulting in a substantial increase in sales for the company outside the United States. In an effort to establish leadership in the defense electronics business, Raytheon purchased in quick succession Dallas-based E-Systems (1995); Chrysler Corporation's defense electronics and aircraft-modification businesses, which had previously acquired companies such as Electrospace systems (1996) (portions of these businesses were later sold to L-3 Communications), and the defense unit of Texas Instruments, Defense Systems & Electronics Group (1997)."
 History , 1990s ,"Also in 1997, Raytheon acquired the aerospace and defense business of Hughes Aircraft Company from Hughes Electronics Corporation, a subsidiary of General Motors, which included a number of product lines previously purchased by Hughes Electronics, including the former General Dynamics missile business (Pomona facility), the defense portion of Delco Electronics (Delco Systems Operations), and Magnavox Electronic Systems.Raytheon also divested itself of several nondefense businesses in the 1990s, including Amana Refrigeration, Raytheon Commercial Laundry (purchased by Bain Capital's Alliance Laundry Systems), and Seismograph Service Ltd (sold to Schlumberger-Geco-Prakla)."
 History , 1990s ,"On October 12, 1999, Raytheon exited the personal rapid transit (PRT) business as it terminated its PRT 2000 system due to the high cost of development and the lack of interest."
 History , 2000s ,"In November 2007, Raytheon purchased Sarcos for an undisclosed sum, seeking to expand into robotics research and production.In September 2009, Raytheon entered into an agreement to acquire BBN Technologies. The acquisition was completed on October 29, 2009."
 History , 2010s ,"In December 2010, Applied Signal Technology agreed to be acquired by Raytheon for $490 million.In October 2014, Raytheon beat rivals Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for a contract to build 3DELRR, a next-generation long-range radar system, for the USAF worth an estimated $1 billion.The contract award was immediately protested by Raytheon's competitors, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. After re-evaluating the bids following the protests, the USAF decided to delay awarding the 3DELRR EMD contract until 2017 and was to issue an amended solicitation at the end of July 2016."
 History , 2010s ,"In 2017 the USAF again awarded the contract to Raytheon.In May 2015, Raytheon acquired cybersecurity firm Websense, Inc. from Vista Equity Partners for $1.9 billion and combined it with RCP, formerly part of its IIS segment to form Raytheon|Websense.

 Products and services , Training Services and Learning Outsourcing ,"It has gained US$3.8 billion in financial benefit and has set a common language and culture across the company. Two lawsuits were filed against a Raytheon Company plant in St. Petersburg, Florida, due to concern with health risks, property values, and contamination in April 2008. Raytheon was given until the end of the month to independently test whether or not the groundwater that originated from its area was contaminated. According to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the groundwater contained carcinogenic contaminants, including trichloroethylene, 1,4-dioxane, and vinyl chloride."
 Products and services , Training Services and Learning Outsourcing ,"The DEP also reported that the clouds contained other toxins, such as lead and toluene.In 1995, Raytheon acquired Dallas-based E-Systems, including a site in St. Petersburg, Florida. In November 1991, prior to Raytheon's acquisition, contamination had been discovered at the E-Systems site. Soil and groundwater had been contaminated with the volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene and 1,4-Dioxane. In 2005, groundwater monitoring indicated polluted groundwater was moving into areas outside the site."
 Products and services , Training Services and Learning Outsourcing ,"According to DEP documentation, Raytheon has tested wells on its site since 1996 but had not delivered a final report; therefore, it was given a deadline on May 31, 2008, to investigate its groundwater."

" ""Bushy Park"" and ""Carrs Mill"" ",,"The namesake millhouse was situated on the northern portion of an estate, near the intersection of modern Bushy Park Road and Carrs Mill Road. Carr's Mill is part of the original estate of Charles Alexander Warfield. Warfield married Elizebeth Ridgley of Laurel in 1771 and settled in a log home at ""Bushy Park"" in Glenwood, Maryland. The same year he started construction on his slave plantation manor home. The property later was owned by the ""Hammond"" family of the Major Charles Family line. The manor stood for over 150 years, burning in 1933 and demolished in 1947."
" ""Bushy Park"" and ""Carrs Mill"" ",,"A new house was built over the original foundation. In 1978 the property was purchased by the Clevenger family and had been subdivided down to 342 acres, but was still actively farmed. In 1983 it had been subdivided down to a 190-acre parcel named ""Bushy Park Farm"" and sold again. A portion of the original estate became the Carr's mill landfill. Warfield is buried at Bushy Park. The walled cemetery remains, but the majority of the 1300 acre farm has been redeveloped as the Western Regional Park, operated by Howard County."
" ""Bushy Park"" and ""Carrs Mill"" ",,"Both Carr's Mill and New Cut landfill were reaching capacity in the early 1970s. With the approval and construction of the Rouse Company development Columbia, the population of the county would quadruple while the landfill was in operation. County executive Edward L. Cochran was already starting the controversial process of selection of a new site, when Carr's Mill became a site of hazardous waste dumping by Western Electric in 1976. Howard County spent millions of dollars to cap the landfill and dispose of hazardous materials after contamination of groundwater on the site."
" ""Bushy Park"" and ""Carrs Mill"" ",,"In July 1976, an anonymous tip stated that Francis ""sonny"" Bohager was bribed $250 from F.P.R Bohager & Sons Inc of Fells Point to allow hazardous waste onsite. Police intercepted two Bohager trucks dumping 101 barrels hazardous materials from Farboil Paint Co. on Key Highway and Western Electric Company by the service road of Carr's Mill. Western Electric had contracted the company to haul 2,700 barrels of hazardous waste in 1976. In July 1976, police reported barrels of hazardous waste were reported to be found buried at the landfill, but were not investigated further."
" ""Bushy Park"" and ""Carrs Mill"" ",,"In December, a task force selecting new landfill sites offered Carrs Mill as a site for landfill consolidation for Western Howard County before shipment out of county which was only implemented at the historic Trinity Church property in Elkridge. Carrs Mill ceased operations in 1977.In 1991, contaminants were discovered in test wells at the landfill site. In 1993, 900 drums of waste were found at the same location where the uninvestigated barrels were reported."
" ""Bushy Park"" and ""Carrs Mill"" ",,"30 more were found in September in an overgrown area feeding into the Cattail creek by Geo-Trans, who was performing a $7.8 million contamination investigation at all three landfill sites. Metal detector tests found 100 more drums within 100 ft. John J. O'Hara, chief of the Howard County Bureau of Environmental Services announced to the press there was no way of finding who dumped the toxic waste, despite a police report, markings on the barrels, and a County effort to fine the companies. Ground water tests revealed Trichloroethylene and a form of dichlorothene level far higher than EPA limits."
" ""Bushy Park"" and ""Carrs Mill"" ",,"In 1994, the county held an evening meeting announced that day in the Baltimore Sun, to inform residents about the 840 drums found so far by posting a copy of the report in the Public works Building in Ellicott City. A $2.4 million mitigation plan removed 4,000 tons of soil, capped 8 acres of the landfill trenches, and drilled 14 pumping wells to clean ground water around the site."
" ""Bushy Park"" and ""Carrs Mill"" ",,"In 1997, Waste Management of Maryland (purchaser of F.P.R Bohager and Sons), The Beatrice Company (purchaser of Farboil Co), and Lucent Technologies paid $2.85 million toward cleanup of the site without admitting liability.Altogether, the Carrs Mill Landfill has been cited with seven EPA Clean Water Act Violations.

 Lowest achievable emissions rate ,,The Lowest achievable emissions rate (LAER) is used by the EPA to determine if emissions from a new or modified major stationary source are acceptable under SIP guidelines. LAER standards are required when a new stationary source is located in a non-attainment air-quality region. It is the most stringent air pollution standard above the best available control technology and reasonably available control technology standards.

It is the current EPA standard for all polluting sources that fall under the New Source Review guidelines and is determined on a case-by-case basis. The BACT standard is significantly more stringent than the reasonably available control technology standard but much less stringent than the lowest achievable emissions rate standard."
 Lowest achievable emissions rate ,,Reasonably available control technology (RACT) is a pollution control standard created by the EPA and is used to determine what air pollution control technology will be used to control a specific pollutant to a specified limit. RACT applies to existing sources in areas that are not meeting national ambient air quality standards on controlled air pollutants and is required on all sources that meet these criteria. The RACT standard is less stringent than either the BACT or the LAER standard set forth by the EPA.

 Introduction ,,"Some pollution control laws are organized with varying degrees of stringency. The different standards may be based on several factors, including whether the pollution source is an existing facility at the time the standard is published, or is constructed after publication. The standards for new sources may be more stringent than that for existing facilities, on the principle that a new plant can be designed with the latest and most advanced control technologies.: 82–83 The Clean Air Act NSPS dictate the level of pollution that a new stationary source may produce."
 Introduction ,,These standards are authorized by Section 111 of the CAA and the regulations are published in 40 CFR Part 60. NSPS have been established for a number of individual industrial or source categories. Examples: Air emissions from chemical manufacturing wastewater Boilers Landfills Petroleum refineries Stationary gas turbines.
 Clean Air Act , Basic process for establishing standards ,"Identify type of emitting facility. For each type of facility, identify the type of pollutant control technology that is appropriate. From a study of all the plants and all the information available about the plants and their technologies, establish an allowed concentration of the criteria pollutants that is the upper limit of what can be emitted.: 84–85 Under the Clean Water Act, NSPS set the level of allowable wastewater discharges from new industrial facilities. EPA issues NSPS for categories of industrial dischargers, typically in conjunction with the issuance of effluent guidelines for existing sources."
 Clean Air Act , Basic process for establishing standards ,"In developing NSPS, the CWA requires that EPA determine the ""best available demonstrated control technology"" (BADCT) for the particular industrial category. BADCT may be more stringent than the best available technology economically achievable standard used for existing dischargers. This consideration may include setting a ""no discharge of pollutants standard"" (also called a ""zero discharge"" standard) if practicable.NSPS regulations are published at 40 CFR Subchapter N (Parts 405-499)."
 Clean Air Act , Basic process for establishing standards ,"NSPS issued by EPA include the following categories: Coal Mining Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (including zero discharge requirements) Dairy Products Inorganic Chemicals Manufacturing (including a zero discharge requirement for several subcategories) Iron and Steel Manufacturing Oil and Gas Extraction Petroleum Refining Pulp, Paper and Paperboard Sugar Processing (including a zero discharge requirement for one subcategory) Textile Mills.EPA published a general definition of ""new source"" in its wastewater permit regulations. More specialized definitions of ""new source"" are included in some of the individual category regulations, e.g., the definition for the Pulp, Paper and Paperboard category."

 History ,,"The Newby Island landfill opened in 1938. It operated as an open burning dump until 1956 when it became a landfill. In 1956, the San Jose Scavenger Company started the landfill operations. In 1968, it was annexed into the city of San Jose as a non-conforming zone.In 1973, Browning-Ferris Industries (BFI) of Northern California began operation of this site late in 1973.In 1981, a 166-acre (67 ha) expansion was approved, making Newby Island Landfill the largest landfill in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1994, composting operations started on the Newby site."
 History ,,"Later a settlement agreement between the City of Milpitas, City of San Jose, Browning-Ferris Industries, and the International Disposal Company of California resulted in some odor mitigation strategies, such as relocation of the composting area to the westernmost section of the landfill to reduce the odor impact.In 1999, BFI was sold to Allied Industries. In 2007, a 95 feet (29 m) height expansion was proposed and approved by San Jose in 2012. In 2008, Allied Waste was acquired by Republic Services Group based in Florida."
 History ,,"In August 2012, Republic Services announced the Newby Island Resource Recovery Park located on the same site, the world's largest recycling operation. It processes up to 110 short tons (100,000 kg) per hour of multiple waste streams. The facility will process all of the commercial waste generated by businesses in San Jose. Newby Island houses the local hauling company, recyclery, composting facility and landfill.In 2014, Allied Waste submitted a permit to increase the capacity enough to hold 245 towering feet msl of trash from the current allowed height of 150 feet (46 m)."
 History ,,"The capacity would increase from 50.8 million cubic yards (38.8 million cubic meters) to 65.9 million cubic yards (50.38 million cubic meters). The new closure date would be 2041. Despite appeals and protests from the City of Milpitas and its citizens, the permit was approved by the San Jose Planning commission on December 7, 2016.In 2016, Republic Services settled a class-action lawsuit over the alleged landfill odor pollution. Republic will create a $1.2 million fund to be paid to households within a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) radius from the landfill."
 History ,,"In addition, Republic agreed to provide $2 million to mitigate odors over the next five years. Odor mitigation will include updating the gas collection system and also modifying the composting operation to use forced air static piles.Also in 2016, Newby Island landfill started the South Bay Odor Stakeholders Group to bring together various agencies and facilities producing odor. Although they are holding meetings, it is too early to see if they will be able to make a difference in the odor pollution issues in the area. Many agencies and facilities are refusing to attend the meeting."
 History ,,"Also the group doesn't have any enforcement powers. Also in 2016, the City of Milpitas decided against using Newby Island Landfill for solid waste disposal. Milpitas also decided not to select Republic Services (the owner of the Newby island facility) to do garbage collections. Residents worried that the Milpitas City Council might allow whoever was awarded the collection contract to take the city's garbage to Newby Island drafted Measure L for the Nov 2016 ballot. Mipitas voters overwhelmingly supported sending the city's garbage to a different landfill owned by Waste Management, Kirby Canyon Landfill."
 History ,,Garden City Sanitation was selected as the new waste collector. This ended Republic's long contract with the City of Milpitas for both garbage collections and disposal. CalRecycle Page on the Newby Island Site: Republic Services site about Newby Milpitas Odor Information
 State and federal agency responsibilities ,,"The Clean Water Act requires that state environmental agencies complete TMDLs for impaired waters and that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) review and approve / disapprove those TMDLs. Because both state and federal governments are involved in completing TMDLs, the TMDL program is an example of cooperative federalism. If a state doesn't take action to develop TMDLs, or if EPA disapproves state-developed TMDLs, the EPA is responsible for issuing TMDLs. EPA published regulations in 1992 establishing TMDL procedures. Application of TMDLs has broadened significantly in the last decade to include many watershed-scale efforts, including the Chesapeake Bay TMDL."
 State and federal agency responsibilities ,,"TMDLs identify all point source and nonpoint source pollutants within a watershed. The Clean Water Act requires states to compile lists of water bodies that do not fully support beneficial uses such as aquatic life, fisheries, drinking water, recreation, industry, or agriculture; and to prioritize those water bodies for TMDL development. These inventories are known as ""303(d) lists"" and characterize waters as fully supporting, impaired, or in some cases threatened for beneficial uses. Beneficial use determinations must have sufficient credible water quality data for TMDL planning."
 State and federal agency responsibilities ,,"Throughout the U.S., data are often lacking adequate spatial or temporal coverage to reliably establish the sources and magnitude of water quality degradation. TMDL planning in large watersheds is a process that typically involves the following steps: Watershed characterization—understanding the basic physical, environmental, and human elements of the watershed. Impairment status—analyzing existing data to determine if waters fully support beneficial uses Data gaps and monitoring report—identification of any additional data needs and monitoring recommendations Source assessment—identification of sources of pollutants, and magnitude of sources. Load allocation—determination of natural pollutant load, and load from human activities (i.e."
 State and federal agency responsibilities ,,diffuse nonpoint sources and point discharges). Set targets—establishment of water quality targets intended to restore or maintain beneficial uses. TMDL implementation plan—a watershed management strategy to attain established targets.
 Planning process , Water quality targets ,"The purpose of water quality targets is to protect or restore beneficial uses and protect human health. These targets may include state/federal numerical water quality standards or narrative standards, i.e. within the range of ""natural"" conditions. Establishing targets to restore beneficial uses is challenging and sometimes controversial. For example, the restoration of a fishery may require reducing temperatures, nutrients, sediments, and improving habitat.Necessary values for each pollutant target to restore fisheries can be uncertain. The potential for a water body to support a fishery even in a pristine state can be uncertain."
 Planning process , Background ,Calculating the TMDL for any given body of water involves the combination of factors that contribute to the problem of nutrient concentrated runoff. Bodies of water are tested for contaminants based on their intended use. Each body of water is tested similarly but designated with a different TMDL. Drinking water reservoirs are designated differently from areas for public swimming and water bodies intended for fishing are designated differently from water located in wildlife conservation areas. The size of the water body also is taken into consideration when TMDL calculating is undertaken.
 Planning process , Background ,"The larger the body of water, the greater the amounts of contaminants can be present and still maintain a margin of safety. The margin of safety (MOS) is numeric estimate included in the TMDL calculation, sometimes 10% of the TMDL, intended to allow a safety buffer between the calculated TMDL and the actual load that will allow the water body to meet its beneficial use (since the natural world is complex and several variables may alter future conditions). TMDL is the end product of all point and non-point source pollutants of a single contaminant."
 Planning process , Background ,Pollutants that originate from a point source are given allowable levels of contaminants to be discharged; this is the waste load allocation (WLA). Nonpoint source pollutants are also calculated into the TMDL equation with load allocation (LA).
 Planning process , Calculation ,"The calculation of a TMDL is as follows: T M D L = W L A + L A + M O S {\displaystyle TMDL=WLA+LA+MOS} where WLA is the waste load allocation for point sources, LA is the load allocation for nonpoint sources, and MOS is the margin of safety."
 Planning process , Load allocations ,"Load allocations are equally challenging as setting targets. Load allocations provide a framework for determining the relative share of natural sources and human sources of pollution. The natural background load for a pollutant may be imprecisely understood. Industrial dischargers, farmers, land developers, municipalities, natural resource agencies, and other watershed stakeholders each have a vested interest in the outcome. To implement TMDLs with point sources, wasteload allocations are incorporated into discharge permits for these sources. The permits are issued by EPA or delegated state agencies under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). Nonpoint source discharges (e.g."
 Planning process , Load allocations ,"agriculture) are generally in a voluntary compliance scenario. The TMDL implementation plan is intended to help bridge this divide and ensure that watershed beneficial uses are restored and maintained. Local watershed groups play a critical role in educating stakeholders, generating funding, and implementing projects to reduce nonpoint sources of pollution.

 Alternative to conventional stormwater management practices ,,"A concept that began in Prince George's County, Maryland in 1990, LID began as an alternative to traditional stormwater best management practices (BMPs) installed at construction projects. Officials found that the traditional practices such as detention ponds and retention basins were not cost-effective and the results did not meet water quality goals. The Low Impact Development Center, Inc., a non-profit water resources research organization, was formed in 1998 to work with government agencies and institutions to further the science, understanding, and implementation of LID and other sustainable environmental planning and design approaches, such as Green Infrastructure and the Green Highways Partnership."
 Alternative to conventional stormwater management practices ,,"The LID design approach has received support from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and is being promoted as a method to help meet goals of the Clean Water Act. Various local, state, and federal agency programs have adopted LID requirements in land development codes and implemented them in public works projects. LID techniques can also play an important role in Smart Growth and Green infrastructure land use planning."
 Alternative to conventional stormwater management practices ,,"The basic principle of LID to use nature as a model and manage rainfall at the source is accomplished through sequenced implementation of runoff prevention strategies, runoff mitigation strategies, and finally, treatment controls to remove pollutants. Although Integrated Management Practices (IMPs) — decentralized, microscale controls that infiltrate, store, evaporate, and detain runoff close to the source — get most of the attention by engineers, it is crucial to understand that LID is more than just implementing a new list of practices and products."
 Alternative to conventional stormwater management practices ,,"It is a strategic design process to create a sustainable site that mimics the undeveloped hydrologic properties of the site. It requires a prescriptive approach that is appropriate for the proposed land use. Design using LID principles follows four simple steps. Determine pre-developed conditions and identify the hydrologic goal (some jurisdictions suggest going to wooded conditions). Assess treatment goals, which depend on site use and local keystone pollutants. Identify a process that addresses the specific needs of the site."
 Alternative to conventional stormwater management practices ,,"Implement a practice that utilizes the chosen process and that fits within the site's constraints.The basic processes used to manage stormwater include pretreatment, filtration, infiltration, and storage and reuse."
 Designing for low-impact development , Pre-treatment ,"Pre-treatment is recommended to remove pollutants such as trash, debris, and larger sediments. Incorporation of a pretreatment system, such as a hydrodynamic separator, can prolong the longevity of the entire system by preventing the primary treatment practice from becoming prematurely clogged."
 Designing for low-impact development , Filtration ,"When stormwater is passed through a filter media, solids and other pollutants are removed. Most media remove solids by mechanical processes. The gradation of the media, irregularity of shape, porosity, and surface roughness characteristics all influence solids removal. Many other pollutants such as nutrients and metals can be removed through chemical and/or biological processes. Filtration is a key component to LID sites, especially when infiltration is not feasible. Filter systems can be designed to remove the primary pollutants of concern from runoff and can be configured in decentralized small-scale inlets."
 Designing for low-impact development , Filtration ,This allows for runoff to be treated close to its source without additional collection or conveyance infrastructure.
 Designing for low-impact development , Infiltration ,"Infiltration reclaims stormwater runoff and allows for groundwater recharge. Runoff enters the soil and percolates through to the subsurface. The rate of infiltration is affected by soil compaction and storage capacity, and will decrease as the soil becomes saturated. The soil texture and structure, vegetation types and cover, water content of the soil, soil temperature, and rainfall intensity all play a role in controlling infiltration rate and capacity. Infiltration plays a critical role in LID site design. Some of the benefits of infiltration include improved water quality (as water is filtered through the soil) and reduction in runoff."
 Designing for low-impact development , Infiltration ,"When distributed throughout a site, infiltration can significantly help maintain the site's natural hydrology."
 Designing for low-impact development , Storage and reuse ,Capturing and reusing stormwater as a resource helps maintain a site's predevelopment hydrology while creating an additional supply of water for irrigation or other purposes. Rainwater harvesting is an LID practice that facilitates the reuse of stormwater. There are 5 core requirements when it comes to designing for LID. Conserve natural areas wherever possible (don't pave over the whole site if you don't need to). Minimize the development impact on hydrology. Maintain runoff rate and duration from the site (don't let the water leave the site).
 Designing for low-impact development , Storage and reuse ,"Scatter integrated management practices (IMPs) throughout your site – IMPs are decentralized, microscale controls that infiltrate, store, evaporate, and/or detain runoff close to the source. Implement pollution prevention, proper maintenance and public education programs. Planning practices include several related approaches that were developed independently by various practitioners. These differently named approaches include similar concepts and share similar goals in protecting water quality. Conservation design, also called Conservation Development Better Site Design Green Infrastructure.Planners select structural LID practices for an individual site in consideration of the site's land use, hydrology, soil type, climate and rainfall patterns."
 Designing for low-impact development , Storage and reuse ,"There are many variations on these LID practices, and some practices may not be suitable for a given site. Many are practical for retrofit or site renovation projects, as well as for new construction. Optimal places for retrofitting LID are single houses, school/university areas, and parks. Frequently used practices include: Bioretention cells, also known as rain gardens Cisterns and rain barrels Green roofs Pervious concrete, also called ""porous pavement"", similar to Permeable paving Grassed swales, also known as bioswales. Commercially manufactured stormwater management devices that capture pollutants (e.g., media filters) and/or aid in on-site infiltration."
 Designing for low-impact development , Storage and reuse ,"Tree pits Urban areas are especially prone to create barriers for LID practices. The most common limits are: Lack of suitable places for LID facilities in existing complex infrastructure of urban areas Lack of design standards that can be applicable around the world Lack of knowledge about LID technology among local governments and residents Varied performance due to lack of understanding of climate difference False belief that LID practices are difficult to maintain and/or the maintenance cost is high. LID has multiple benefits, such as protecting animal habitats, improving management of runoff and flooding, and reducing impervious surfaces. For example, Dr."
 Designing for low-impact development , Storage and reuse ,"Allen Davis from the University of Maryland, College Park conducted research on the runoff management from LID rain gardens. His data indicated that LID rain gardens can hold up to 90% of water after a major rain event and release this water over a time scale of up to two weeks. LID also improves groundwater quality and increases its quantity, which increases aesthetics, therefore raising community value. LID can also be used to eliminate the need for stormwater ponds, which occupy expensive land."
 Designing for low-impact development , Storage and reuse ,"Incorporating LID into designs enables developers to build more homes on the same plot of land and maximize their profits. In some municipalities, LID can be a cost-effective way to reduce the incidence of combined sewer overflows (CSO).According to the co-benefits approach, LID is an opportunity to technically mitigate urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon with higher compatibilities in cool pavement and green infrastructures."
 Designing for low-impact development , Storage and reuse ,"Although there are some intrinsic discrepancies among understandings of LID and UHI mitigation towards blue infrastructure, the osmotic pool, wet pond, and regulating pond are essential supplements to urban water bodies, performing their roles in nourishing vegetation and evaporating for cooling in UHI mitigation. LID pilot projects have already provided the financial foundation for taking the UHI mitigation further. It is an attempt for people in different disciplines to synergistically think about how to mitigate UHI effects, which is conducive to the generation of holistic policies, guidelines and regulations."
 Designing for low-impact development , Storage and reuse ,"Furthermore, the inclusion of UHI mitigation can be a driver to public participation in SPC construction, which can consolidate the PPP model for more funds.

 Background ,,"The six criteria air pollutants were the first set of pollutants recognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as needing standards on a national level. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for the six CAPs. The NAAQS are health based and the EPA sets two types of standards: primary and secondary. The primary standards are designed to protect the health of 'sensitive' populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. The secondary standards are concerned with protecting the environment."
 Background ,,"They are designed to address visibility, damage to crops, vegetation, buildings, and animals.The EPA established the NAAQS according to Sections 108 and 109 of the U.S. Clean Air Act, which was last amended in 1990."

Ground level ozone (O3): Ozone found on the surface-level, also known as tropospheric ozone is also regulated by the NAAQS under the Clean Air Act."
 Background ,,"Ozone was originally found to be damaging to grapes in the 1950s. The US EPA set ""oxidants"" standards in 1971, which included ozone. These standards were created to reduce agricultural impacts and other related damages. Like lead, ozone requires a reexamination of new findings of health and vegetation effects periodically. This aspect necessitated the creation of a US EPA criteria document. Further analysis done in 1979 and 1997 made it necessary to significantly modify the pollution standards."
 Background ,,"Atmospheric particulate matter PM10, coarse particles: 2.5 micrometers (μm) to 10 μm in size (although current implementation includes all particles 10 μm or less in the standard) PM2.5, fine particles: 2.5 μm in size or less. Particulate Matter (PM) was listed in the 1996 Criteria document issued by the EPA. In April 2001, the EPA created a Second External Review Draft of the Air Quality Criteria for PM, which addressed updated studies done on particulate matter and the modified pollutant standards done since the First External Review Draft."
 Background ,,"In May 2002, a Third External Review Draft was made, and the EPA revised PM requirements again. After issuing a fourth version of the document, the EPA issued the final version in October 2004. Lead (Pb): In the mid-1970s, lead was listed as a criteria air pollutant that required NAAQS regulation. In 1977, the EPA published a document which detailed the Air Quality Criteria for lead. This document was based on the scientific assessments of lead at the time."
 Background ,,"Based on this report (1977 Lead AQCD), the EPA established a ""1.5 µg/m3 (maximum quarterly calendar average) Pb NAAQS in 1978."" The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of NAAQS, and new scientific data published after 1977 made it necessary to revise the standards previously established in the 1977 Lead AQCD document. An Addendum to the document was published in 1986 and then again as a Supplement to the 1986 AQCD/Addendum in 1990."
 Background ,,"In 1990, a Lead Staff Paper was prepared by the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OPQPS), which was based on information presented in the 1986 Lead/AQCD/Addendum and 1990 Supplement, in addition to other OAQPS sponsored lead exposure/risk analyses. In this paper, it was proposed that the Pb NAAQS be revised further and presented options for revision to the EPA. The EPA elected to not modify the Pb NAAQS further, but decided to instead focus on the 1991 U.S. EPA Strategy for Reducing Lead Exposure."
 Background ,,"The EPA concentrated on regulatory and remedial clean-up efforts to minimize Pb exposure from numerous non-air sources that caused more severe public health risks, and undertook actions to reduce air emissions. Carbon monoxide (CO): The EPA set the first NAAQS for carbon monoxide in 1971. The primary standard was set at 9 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period and 35 ppm over a 1-hour period. The majority of CO emitted into the ambient air is from mobile sources. The EPA has reviewed and assessed the current scientific literature with respect to CO in 1979, 1984, 1991, and 1994."
 Background ,,"After the review in 1984 the EPA decided to remove the secondary standard for CO due to lack of significant evidence of the adverse environmental impacts. On January 28, 2011 the EPA decided that the current NAAQS for CO were sufficient and proposed to keep the existing standards as they stood. The EPA is strengthening monitoring requirements for CO by calling for CO monitors to be placed in strategic locations near large urban areas."
 Background ,,"Specifically, the EPA has called for monitors to be placed and operational in CBSA's (core based statistical areas) with populations over 2.5 million by January 1, 2015; and in CBSA's with populations of 1 million or more by January 1, 2017. In addition they are requiring the collocation of CO monitors with NO2 monitors in urban areas having a population of 1 million for more. As of May 2011 there were approximately 328 operational CO monitors in place nationwide."
 Background ,,"The EPA has provided some authority to the EPA Regional Administrators to oversee case-by-case requested exceptions and in determining the need for additional monitoring systems above the minimum required. The EPA reports the national average concentration of CO has decreased by 82% since 1980. The last nonattainment designation was deemed in attainment on September 27, 2010. Currently all areas in the US are in attainment. Sulfur oxides (SOx): SOx refers to the oxides of sulfur, a highly reactive group of gases. SO2 is of greatest interest and is used as the indicator for the entire SOx family."
 Background ,,"The EPA first set primary and secondary standards in 1971. Dual primary standards were set at 140 ppb averaged over a 24-hour period, and at 30 ppb averaged annually. The secondary standard was set at 500 ppb averaged over a 3-hour period, not to be exceeded more than once a year. The most recent review took place in 1996 during which the EPA considered implementing a new NAAQS for 5-minute peaks of SO2 affecting sensitive populations such as asthmatics. The Agency did not establish this new NAAQS and kept the existing standards."
 Background ,,"In 2010 the EPA decided to replace the dual primary standards with a new 1-hour standard set at 75 ppb. On March 20, 2012, the EPA ""took final action"" to maintain the existing NAAQS as they stood. Only three monitoring sites have exceeded the current NAAQS for SO2, all of which are located in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The violations occurred between 2007–2008 and the state of Hawaii suggested these should be exempt from regulatory actions due to an 'exceptional event' (volcanic activity). Since 1980 the national concentration of SO2 in the ambient air has decreased by 83%."
 Background ,,"Annual average concentrations hover between 1–6 ppb. Currently all ACQR's are in attainment for SO2. Nitrogen oxides (NOx): The EPA first set primary and secondary standards for the oxides of nitrogen in 1971. Among these are nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), all of which are covered in the NAAQS. NO2 is the oxide measured and used as the indicator for the entire NOx family as it is of the most concern due to its quick formation and contribution to the formation of harmful ground level ozone."
 Background ,,"In 1971 the primary and secondary NAAQS for NO2 were both set at an annual average of 0.053 ppm. The EPA reviewed this NAAQS in 1985 and 1996, and in both cases concluded that the existing standard was sufficient. The most recent review by the EPA occurred in 2010, resulting in a new 1-hour NO2 primary standard set at 100 ppb; the annual average of 0.053 ppm remained the same. Also considered was a new 1-hour secondary standard of 100 ppb."
 Background ,,"This was the first time the EPA reviewed the environmental impacts separate from the health impacts for this group of criteria air pollutants. Also, in 2010, the EPA decided to ensure compliance by strengthening monitoring requirements, calling for increased numbers of monitoring systems near large urban areas and major roadways. On March 20, 2012, the EPA ""took final action"" to maintain the existing NAAQS as they stand. The national average of NOx concentrations has dropped by 52% since 1980."
 Background ,,"The annual concentration for NO2 is reported to be averaging around 10–20 ppb, and is expected to decrease further with new mobile source regulations. Currently all areas of the US are classified as in attainment.In April 2023, the EPA finalized its ""Good Neighbor Plan"", which phases in tighter standards for NOx, using a cap and trade system during the summer ""ozone season"". This is intended to reduce ground-level ozone in non-attainment areas downwind of industrial sources like power plants, incinerators, and industrial furnaces, often in other states. The standards are listed in 40 CFR 50."
 Background ,,"Primary standards are designed to protect human health, with an adequate margin of safety, including sensitive populations such as children, the elderly, and individuals suffering from respiratory diseases. Secondary standards are designed to protect public welfare, damage to property, transportation hazards, economic values, and personal comfort and well-being from any known or anticipated adverse effects of a pollutant."
 Background ,,"A district meeting a given standard is known as an ""attainment area"" for that standard, and otherwise a ""non-attainment area"".Standards are required to ""accurately reflect the latest scientific knowledge,"" and are reviewed every five years by a Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC), consisting of ""seven members appointed by the EPA administrator.""EPA has set NAAQS for six major pollutants listed as below. These six are also the criteria air pollutants."
 Background ,,"^a Each standard has its own criteria for how many times it may be exceeded ^b As of June 15, 2005, the 1-hour ozone standard no longer applies to areas designated with respect to the 8-hour ozone standard (which includes most of the United States, except for portions of 10 states). Source: USEPA The EPA National Exposure Research Laboratory can designate a measurement device using an established technological basis as a Federal Reference Method (FRM) to certify that the device has undergone a testing and analysis protocol, and can be used to monitor NAAQS compliance."
 Background ,,"Devices based on new technologies can be designated as a Federal Equivalent Method (FEM). FEMs are based on different sampling and/or analyzing technologies than FRMs, but are required to provide the same decision making quality when making NAAQS attainment determinations. Approved new methods are formally announced through publication in the Federal Register. A complete list of FRMs and FEMs is available. An air quality control region is an area, designated by the federal government, where communities share a common air pollution problem."

 Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards ,,"The standards for a particular source category require the maximum degree of emission reduction that the EPA determines to be achievable, which is known as the Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards. These standards are authorized by Section 112 of the 1970 Clean Air Act and the regulations are published in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)."
 Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards , Pollutants ,"EPA regulates the following hazardous air pollutants with the MACT standards. For all listings above which contain the word ""compounds"" and for glycol ethers, the following applies: Unless otherwise specified, these listings are defined as including any unique chemical substance that contains the named chemical (i.e., antimony, arsenic, etc.) as part of that chemical's infrastructure. ^1 X'CN where X = H' or any other group where a formal dissociation may occur."

 Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards , Pollutants ,"Most air toxics originate from human-made sources, including mobile sources (e.g., cars, trucks, buses) and stationary sources (e.g., factories, oil refineries, power plants), as well as indoor sources (e.g., building materials and activities such as cleaning). There are two types of stationary sources that generate routine emissions of air toxics: Major sources are defined as sources that emit 10 or more tons per year of any of the listed toxic air pollutants, or 25 or more tons per year of a mixture of air toxics."
 Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards , Pollutants ,"These sources may release air toxics from fugitive emissions (equipment leaks), when materials are transferred from one location to another, or during discharge through emission stacks or vents. Area sources consist of smaller facilities that release lesser quantities of toxic pollutants into the air. Area sources are defined as sources that do not emit more than 10 tons per year of a single air toxic or more than 25 tons per year of a combination of air toxics."
 Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards , Pollutants ,"Although the emissions from individual area sources are often relatively small, collectively their emissions can be of concern, particularly where large numbers of sources are located in heavily populated areas.EPA published its initial list of source categories in 1992. Subsequently the agency issued several revisions and updates to the list and the regulatory promulgation schedule. For each listed source category, EPA indicates whether the sources are considered to be major sources or area sources."
 Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards , Pollutants ,"The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments direct EPA to set standards for all major sources of air toxics, and for some area sources that are of particular concern.

 Background ,,"In 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, enough pharmaceuticals were prescribed to medicate every American adult around-the-clock for one month. Some of these prescriptions and over the counter drugs decay in the home and are highly susceptible to diversion, misuse, and abuse. Often, more Americans currently abuse prescription drugs than the number of those using cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, and inhalants combined, according to the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Studies show that the majority of teens who abuse prescription drugs obtain them from family or friends for free, including from the home medicine cabinet."
 Background ,,"Improper disposal methods can pose both safety and environmental hazards. Four days following the DEA’s first Take-Back Day on September 25, 2010, Congress approved and amendment to the Controlled Substances Act. This action provided the DEA with the option to develop a permanent process for people to safely and conveniently dispose of their prescription drugs."
 Background ,,"President Barack Obama signed the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010, and the DEA immediately began installing regulations for a more permanent solution.The DEA’s Take-Back events are also a reflection of the President's prescription drug abuse prevention strategy entitled ""Epidemic: Responding to America’s Prescription Drug Abuse Crisis"" developed and promoted by the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

 History ,,"The Site had been operating as a municipal landfill from the early 1940s until April 1981. The landfill accepted municipal waste, sewage, and a variety of solid and liquid hazardous wastes (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), products containing dioxin, paint solvents, and similar material). The original landfill was a section of the farm with no liner to prevent material from seeping into the soil. In the original landfill any waste was simply dumped and covered with dirt.In 1972 when the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) rules became more restrictive, the site was cited for violations."
 History ,,"To achieve compliance, pipes were added to drain leachate to two earthen basins which were pumped into trucks for treatment and disposal. Due to leakage from the basins, the system was modified to pump all the leachate to a concrete basin where it was sprayed over the top of the landfill.In the late 1970s, the landfill owners submitted a request to enlarge the landfill which was granted. Work started to enlarge the landfill in 1977, and included an asphalt liner to protect the soil from hazardous materials."
 History ,,"Dumping was reportedly limited to this new area from 1977 to early 1981.Before remediation, contaminants were spread by rain water soaking into the landfill, some of which may have reached the ground water. Run-off from the landfill also carried contaminates to local streams (Skippack Creek and Perkiomen Creek). Local residents tried for years to get the landfill closed. In the late 1970s 450 families united to try to close what they called ""Mount Trashmore"". They packed the local zoning board meetings, wrote letters to several environmental protection agencies, and had lawn signs printed up to close the dump."
 History ,,"In the lawsuit ""O'LEARY v. Moyer's Landfill, Inc., 523 F. Supp. 642 (E.D. Pa. 1981)"" it states ""this suit was brought in part because DER has, in plaintiffs' view, been ineffective in alleviating the dangers plaintiffs perceive at the landfill"".The site was finally closed by the PA DEP in early 1981. Analysis of the leachate dates back to 1972, this analysis was conducted to design an aerated lagoon to treat the liquid. After being designated a Superfund site, tests found heavy metals and organic chemicals. These chemicals included Benzene, toluene, Trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene and chlorobenzene."
 History ,,"All of which are associated with industrial solvents. Samples from the landfill had a total of 86 priority pollutants and 16 metals. Water samples were taken from the Skippack and Perkiomen Creeks and chemicals found in the landfill were also found in both streams. A remediation study was funded at a total cost of $681,000The result of the remediation survey in 1985 an estimate was made that the cost of a cleanup would be $15 million and an additional $340,000 a year for operation and maintenance. By 1994 the price tag has been increased to $45 million for the cleanup."
 History ,,"On May 27, 2014 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) region III removed Moyer's Landfill from the National Priorities List. The site is no longer considered a Superfund site. The site consists of open land surrounded by trees on steep slopes. The landfill is fenced off and has leachate collection tanks. There are no development plans. As of May 4th, 2022, the EPA has published its 4th five-year report on the Moyers Landfill Superfund. Contents include a history and overview of the site, a list of maintenance objectives, leachate discharge rates, leachate sample data, pictures, and a public notice. https://semspub.epa.gov/work/03/2329122.pdf"
 History ,,"The Everglades Forever Act was passed in 1994 as an effort to restore the state's struggling wetlands. In 1996, nearly 70% of Floridians voted to approve the polluter pays amendment to the Constitution. The amendment stated: ""Those in the Everglades Agricultural Area who cause water pollution within the Everglades Protection Area or the Everglades Agricultural Area shall be primarily responsible for paying the costs of the abatement of that pollution."" Sugar farming occurs on approximately 450,000 acres of the EAA.Florida's attorney general Robert A."
 History ,,"Butterworth stated in 1996 that ""while the Legislature may enact provisions implementing Amendment #5, the amendment itself establishes an obligation on polluters of the Everglades to pay the costs of abating such pollution irrespective of legislative action"". However, in 2003, the Supreme Court deemed the provision ""not self-executing and required implementing legislation"". No such legislation has been implemented."
 Overview ,,"Mr. Trash Wheel is a moored vessel that removes trash from the mouth of the Jones Falls river at Baltimore's Inner Harbor. Rubbish from the streets of Baltimore is flushed into storm drains that empty into the Jones Falls river. The floating rubbish is then carried by the river to its outlet into the Inner Harbor, where it is captured by Mr. Trash Wheel. Mr. Trash Wheel is powered by the current from the river, and backup power is provided by solar panels when the current is sluggish. These power a conveyor belt. Mr."
 Overview ,,"Trash Wheel removes floating debris using rotating forks that dip into and out of the water, and which then place the trash onto a conveyor belt which moves it into a dumpster. The water wheel can be controlled remotely on the Internet. Mr. Trash Wheel was constructed using $720,000 of public and private funding. Mr. Trash Wheel was invented by John Kellett, who developed the idea when observing trash in the harbor while passing Pier 6 on his walk to work."
 Overview ,,"A pilot trash wheel was built and launched in the harbor by Kellett in 2008, and after this, Kellett built a larger machine that was launched in May 2014, which was able to pick up larger matter and held two dumpsters onboard. The use of two dumpsters allows the vessel to operate longer, without having to go back to shore to empty the single dumpster that was used on the initial pilot vessel.On April 20, 2015, after the first significant rain storm of the season, Mr. Trash Wheel removed 19 tons of garbage from Baltimore's waterfront on that one day."
 Overview ,,"The previous record for debris removal occurred on May 16, 2014, when the machine removed 11 tons of refuse on that day. At the end of the third quarter in 2016, (which occurred on September 30, 2016), it was noted that Mr. Trash Wheel had collected over 1,000,000 pounds (500 short tons) of trash since its inception.Mr. Trash Wheel is part of the Waterfront Partnership of Baltimore's ""Healthy Harbor Plan"", which has a goal to clean up the harbor to the point of making it swimmable by the year 2020."
 Overview ,,"In 2015, the Waterfront Partnership of Baltimore began fundraising efforts to construct a second water wheel like Mr. Trash Wheel for use ""off the Boston Street Pier Park"" at the Harris Creek outfall in Canton, Baltimore. This second trash wheel has been given the nickname ""Professor Trash Wheel.""Adam Lindquist, director of the Healthy Harbor Initiative, approached What Works Studio to leverage the popularity of a video of the device in 2015. What Works Studio Creative Strategist Justin Allen was immediately struck with the organic look of the device and suggested personifying it with googly eyes and giving it a name."
 Overview ,,"Several names were suggested by the What Works Studio staff but Mr. Trash Wheel is the one that stuck. What Works Studio suggested using Twitter as its primary channel for communication where it started gaining a following under the management of multiple What Works Studio staff. At this point, the googly eyes only existed on images of the trash wheel. The first set of physical eyes, which Lindquist had handmade in his spare time, were removed after a brief period. In March 2016, Key Tech, a Baltimore-based technology solutions company donated a more robust pair of permanent eyes."
 Overview ,,"Several additional trash wheels have been produced after the success of the original. Four patrol the Inner Harbor and there are plans for one on the West Coast and one in Central America. Working with Kellett, Panamanian officials were able to secure a grant to place a trash wheel in Panama City.Like Mr."
 Overview ,,"Trash Wheel, the others deployed so far have also been anthropomorphised: the Canton-based, female-gendered Professor Trash Wheel, visually distinguishable from the other instances due to her green googly eyes with lashes, was commissioned in December 2016; the gender-neutral Captain Trash Wheel without lashes but with brown irises in June 2018 at Brooklyn. Another female-gendered wheel at the mouth of the Gwynns Falls named Gwynnda the Good Wheel of the West. Gwynnda has the same lashes as Professor Trash Wheel but with purple eyes."
 Overview ,,"The largest of the four wheels, Gwynnda picks up more trash and debris than the other three wheels combined. ""Solar-Powered Water Wheel is Cleaning Baltimore's Inner Harbor"". NBC News.

 Basis for controls and regulations ,,The basis for nonpoint source pollution regulation is the negative direct and indirect effects on both human health and the environment caused by the pollutants in NPS effluent.
 Basis for controls and regulations , Human health ,"Human health is most directly affected when polluted water is ingested into the body. Nonpoint source pollution can often have toxic contaminants and chemicals present in the water. Additionally, there can be both bacteria and viruses (aka pathogens) found in the water."
 Basis for controls and regulations , Toxic contaminants and chemicals ,"Effluent from nonpoint sources may include toxic contaminates and chemical compounds including heavy metals like lead, mercury, zinc, and cadmium, organics like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other substances resistant to breakdown. There are many health effects associated with many of these toxic substances. Lead – can cause damage to the nervous connections as well as blood and brain disorders. Specific diseases include nephropathy, colic-like abdominal pains, and anemia. Mercury – Studies have shown effects such as chronic effects including tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbances."
 Basis for controls and regulations , Toxic contaminants and chemicals ,"Acute exposure has shown to cause chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of damage to the lung tissue. Zinc – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose, which can cause loss of the sense of smell. Additionally, zinc toxicosis can occur in high doses of zinc. Cadmium – Exposure to cadmium-containing substances can result initially in metal fume fever but can progress to chemical lung damage, pulmonary edema, and even death."
 Basis for controls and regulations , Toxic contaminants and chemicals ,"PCBs – People exposed to high levels of PCBs can exhibit skin conditions, such as rashes and liver damage. Common symptoms include dermal and ocular lesions, irregular menstrual cycles and lowered immune responses. Other symptoms include fatigue, headaches, coughs, and unusual skin sores. PAHs – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified seven PAH compounds as probable human carcinogens: benz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene."
 Basis for controls and regulations , Pathogens ,"Pathogens are bacteria and viruses that can be found in water and cause diseases in humans. Pathogens found in contaminated runoff may include: Cryptosporidium parvum – Primary symptoms of C. parvum infection are diarrhoea. Other symptoms can include anorexia, nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain. Giardia lamblia – Symptoms of infection include diarrhea, malaise, excessive gas, steatorrhoea, epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, diminished interest in food, and weight loss. Salmonella – Symptoms are usually gastrointestinal. This can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea with mucus, headache, and fatigue."
 Basis for controls and regulations , Pathogens ,"Parasitic worms (helminths) – Conditions associated with intestinal helminth infection include intestinal obstruction, insomnia, vomiting, weakness, and stomach pains."
 Basis for controls and regulations , Environment ,The environment is impacted by nonpoint source pollution through the input of sediment and nutrients from multiple sources directly into the water system.
 Basis for controls and regulations , Toxic contaminants and chemicals ,"Toxic chemicals and contaminants, like motor oil, fuel, and industrial facility waste can enter the water system by storm water runoff. These chemicals, many of which can contain heavy metals, can enter the water system and coat the species present in the water. This can lead to death of the aquatic organisms which can cause increases in the amount of nutrients in the system from the decaying animals."
 Basis for controls and regulations , Sediment ,"Sediment or suspended sediment in the water is soil that would not normally be present in the water column. When the sediment is suspended up in the water column, it blocks out the sunlight which is needed by bottom dwelling plants. If these plants, called submerged aquatic vegetation, are deprived of sunlight for a significant amount of time, they will die. These plants are a significant source of food for many aquatic organisms as well as trap oxygen and sediment."
 Basis for controls and regulations , Sediment ,"When there is an excess of dying plants in an aquatic ecosystem, it can lead to eutophic or hypoxic conditions in the water body."
 Basis for controls and regulations , Nutrients ,"The primary nutrients found in water due to nonpoint source pollution are nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers. An influx of these nutrients can lead to eutrophication within the water. This is when there is an excess of nutrients in water, thus leading to an explosion in the growth of algae. The algae can cover the lake and block sunlight from reaching the organisms below, typically killing them. Some aspects of NPS water pollution are regulated at the federal, state, and local level, but to a lesser extent than point sources. The pollution persists and remains a significant problem in many watersheds."
 Basis for controls and regulations , Nutrients ,"NPS water pollution comes from numerous and diverse sources, and control measures are expensive to implement. State and local governments are generally responsible for implementing NPS regulations. Coordination among localities can be difficult, and, furthermore, localities often lack the incentive to rigorously enforce NPS regulations because their NPS pollution is exported downriver, where other towns and cities must deal with the consequences."
 Legal framework , Federal laws ,"There are two principal federal laws effecting NPS water pollution: the Clean Water Act and the Coastal Zone Management Act. In addition, EPA's ""Clean Water Action Plan"" (2009) outlines a strategy for enforcing CWA requirements, some of which are applicable to nonpoint sources."
 Legal framework , Clean Water Act ,"The Clean Water Act (CWA) was the first federal law designed to directly address water pollution. The CWA has been amended many times, but the 1972 amendments provide the core statutory basis for the regulation of point source water pollution and created the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program. The 1972 amendments were also the first instance where Congress acknowledged the problem of NPS water pollution by requiring the states to prepare area-wide water quality management plans under Section 208. Congress passed additional amendments to the CWA in 1987 that address NPS water pollution."
 Legal framework , Clean Water Act ,This section will chronologically address the parts of the CWA that regulate NPS water pollution.
 Legal framework , Defining NPS water pollution in the CWA ,"The definition of NPS water pollution is open to interpretation. However, federal regulation under the CWA provides a specific legal definition for the term. A ""nonpoint source"" is defined as any source of water pollution that is not a ""point source"" as defined in CWA section 502(14). That definition states: ""The term 'point source' means any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be discharged."
 Legal framework , Defining NPS water pollution in the CWA ,"This term does not include agricultural storm water discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture."" There are important differences between point source pollution and NPS pollution. There are many more nonpoint sources than there are point sources, and nonpoint sources are less discrete, or distinct, than point sources. Furthermore, nonpoint source discharges are not always easily observed, and monitoring nonpoint pollution can be costly. NPS pollution will vary over time and space, based on different weather and geographic conditions. These factors make nonpoint pollution more difficult to regulate than point sources."
 Legal framework , Section 208 ,"Section 208 was Congress' first attempt to address NPS water pollution, and it directed states and local governments to create management plans that identified future waste treatment needs and identify and control NPS water pollution. The section notes that any areawide management plan must discuss how to identify ""agriculturally and silviculturally related nonpoint sources of pollution,"" and ""runoff from manure disposal areas, and from land used for livestock and crop production."" Section 208 is in essence a federal funding mechanism for state programs that attempt to control NPS pollution, but its meager funding was completely used up by 1980."
 Legal framework , Section 208 ,Section 208 was widely considered a failure because it did little to actually reduce NPS pollution. It created a voluntary provision that directs states to study whether regulatory controls are needed. The law left decisions to the states about whether to regulate NPS water pollution. There was no process or mechanism to develop standards or enforce them.
 Legal framework , Section 319 ,"After section 208's failure to control NPS water pollution, in 1987 Congress passed the Water Quality Act which included a new section 319 to address the problem of nonpoint sources. This provision, also non-regulatory, authorizes EPA to fund demonstration programs and provide technical assistance to state and local governments. Some critics have argued that section 319 provides little improvement over section 208. The section requires states to identify water bodies that cannot meet water-quality standards without control of nonpoint sources. The states must then identify best management practices (BMPs) and measures for those impaired sources, along with an implementation plan."
 Legal framework , Section 319 ,"The EPA approves these plans, and if a state fails to develop a plan, the EPA must do so for the state. However, there are a number of problems with these provisions. Funding to develop the plans has been scarce. The section does not actually place limits on NPS pollution, and states are not even required implement the plans they create. Another problem with 319 (and 208) is that there is no enforcement mechanism In Natural Resources Defense Council v."
 Legal framework , Section 319 ,"EPA (1990), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that ""Section 319 does not require states to penalize nonpoint source polluters who fail to adopt best management practices; rather it provides for grants to encourage the adoption of such practices."""
 Legal framework , Section 404 ,"Section 404 of the CWA requires that a permit be obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the ""discharge of dredged and fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites."" The 404 permit process is frequently used to protect wetlands, which are essential to the control of nonpoint pollution because they slow the rate of surface water runoff and remove sediment and other pollutants before they reach lakes and streams."
 Legal framework , Section 404 ,"While these permitting procedures may result in decreased NPS water pollution to wetlands, a land developer may be able to choose to build a project at an alternate location and still cause the release of NPS water pollution."
 Legal framework , Total maximum daily loads ,"CWA section 303(d)(1)(C) requires states to identify waterbodies that do not meet water quality standards after application of the technology-based standards for point source pollution. States must then establish a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for those water bodies to bring them into compliance with water quality standards. The standards are submitted to EPA for approval. As TMDLs are looking at the total amount of loading, this by definition includes nonpoint sources, so if nonpoint sources are impairing a body of water, the TMDL would have to address a way to reduce those nonpoint sources."
 Legal framework , Total maximum daily loads ,TMDLs are required even if a body of water fails to meet quality standards entirely due to nonpoint sources.
 Legal framework , Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations ,"Depending on the number of animals at a particular site, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) may generate significant amounts of manure. One method to remove the manure is to apply it to land for fertilization. However, in an effort to dispose of manure at a reduced costs, some CAFOs have applied excess amounts of manure to land areas. The excess amounts of manure may then be washed away by rain into surface waters. This practice was a key feature in Waterkeeper Alliance et al. v. EPA (2005)."
 Legal framework , Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations ,"Based on that case, decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the EPA created its 2008 CAFO Rule. The rule states that the CWA specifically exempts agricultural storm water runoff from being considered a point source, but based on the court's decision in the Waterkeeper case, EPA may treat land applications of excessive amounts of manure as a point source. While in general agricultural storm water runoff from CAFOs is a nonpoint source, CAFOs may end up requiring an NPDES permit."
 Legal framework , Clean Water Action Plans ,"There have been two ""Clean Water Action Plans"" offered by federal authorities that would affect NPS water pollution. They are both executive orders, not legislation from Congress. The first was issued by President Bill Clinton in 1998. The second, and more recent strategy was issued by Obama Administration in 2009. Both plans provided funding and guidance to address NPS water pollution."
 Legal framework , Coastal Zone Management Act ,"The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) was passed in 1972 and provides for the management of the nation's coast lands and the Great Lakes. When Congress reauthorized the CZMA in 1990, it identified NPS water pollution as a significant factor in the degradation of coastal waters. To address NPS water pollution in coastal areas, the 1990 amendments to the CZMA created the Coastal Zone Enhancement Grants (CZEG) Program. The states must submit information on their programs to the Secretary of Commerce and the EPA Administrator, who are in charge of approving the plan."
 Legal framework , Coastal Zone Management Act ,"The plan is to be implemented in conjunction with the states NPS water pollution plan under section 319 of the CWA and through changes in the overall coastal zone management program. If a state does not submit an approved program, the state may lose a percentage of the grant money provided under the CZMA and under section 319 of the CWA. The EPA is also to provide some guidance to states in developing their NPS coastal management plans through the publication of national guidelines on management measures."
 Legal framework , Coastal Zone Management Act ,These management measures must be economically achievable for new and existing NPS water pollution and must reduce pollution to the greatest extent achievable through current BMPs.
 Legal framework , State & local laws ,"States have primary responsibility for implementing NPS water pollution regulations. Both the CZMA and the CWA direct the states to draft and implement NPS plans, and the federal government plays a limited role. As noted in the previous section on federal regulations, the CWA and CZMA provide financing for states to implement NPS programs, and those NPS programs have taken a variety of forms. The majority of state plans rely on education and technical assistance, including the development of BMPs, to reduce NPS water pollution. Local governments also have an important role to play in NPS regulation."
 Legal framework , State & local laws ,"Local municipality, water conservation districts and other entities with land management responsibility provide planning, zoning, and technical and informational assistance to control NPS pollution. While the approaches states and local governments have taken to regulating NPS water pollution are perhaps too numerous to count, a survey of a few state approaches can provide insight on common NPS implementation plans."
 Legal framework , Indiana ,"Indiana uses a common approach to address NPS pollution known as the watershed approach. A watershed includes ""the total geographic area that drains storm water (and pollutants) to a particular stream, lake, aquifer, or other water body."" The watershed approach to addressing NPS water pollution attempts to address all the relevant water bodies holistically in the context of their watershed while also considering all the potential sources of pollution within a watershed. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) was required under section 303(d) of the CWA to create a list of impaired waters for which TMDLs would be required."
 Legal framework , Indiana ,"IDEM's NPS and watershed efforts concentrate on these impaired water resources. Implementation of TMDLs is managed by local watershed organizations, and NPS pollution controls are only voluntary. Watershed groups use funding from IDEM to create incentive programs for the use of BMPs, as well as provide public information and education. Funding sources for NPS pollution regulation in Indiana include CWA 319(h) grants; CWA 205(j) grants; grants from the Environmental Quality Incentives Program of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008; and a wide variety of foundations and individual fundraising."
 Legal framework , Indiana ,Zoning ordinances may also be structured in a way that limits NPS water pollution.
 Legal framework , California ,"California's NPS plan requires coordination from 28 different state agencies, which reveals the institutional challenges that NPS regulation may encounter. The California State Water Resources Control Board's Division of Water Quality and the California Coastal Commission (CCC) designed California's NPS plan pursuant to the CWA and the Federal Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990. California's NPS plan for 1998–2013 states that California, like Indiana, uses a watershed management approach to controlling NPS pollution."
 Legal framework , California ,"The plan began by identifying roughly 1,500 water body-pollutant combinations that would require a TMDL under the CWA section 303(d).The plan takes a three tiered approach to implement management measures for NPS pollution. The first tier considers ""self-determined implementation of best management practices."" This essentially considers voluntary programs, grants, and education. California has a number of educational programs designed to help alert local policymakers to the problems associated with NPS pollution, including the California Water and Land Use Partnership and the Model Urban Runoff Program."
 Legal framework , California ,"Incentive programs under this tier include measure like financial assistance for local watershed stewardship projects through grants from the CWA section 319 and environmental quality incentives programs for implementation cost-sharing. The first tier is less stringent than tiers two or three. The second tier of the plan is called the ""regulatory-based encouragement of management practices."" The second tier essentially works by allowing polluters to adopt certain managements measures that discourage NPS pollution rather than go through various permitting procedures."
 Legal framework , California ,"Regional water quality control boards may work with landowners and resource managers to waive the adoption of waste discharge requirements (WDRs), a type of effluent limitation, if a polluter adopts certain BMPs. The third tier is called ""effluent limitations and enforcement."" The effluent limitations may be set at a level where the only realistic manner of compliance is the adoption of BMPs."
 Legal framework , California ,"These limitations are command and control requirements for some activities, including for example WDRs for commercial nurseries, WDRs for selenium for the San Joaquin River, permitted storm water programs, erosion control for Lake Tahoe, and WDRs for dairies.A number of these regulations are derived from California's Porter-Cologne Act, which established the State Water Resources Control Board, along with nine regional boards that are tasked with implementing the Porter Cologne Act. The Act created state water quality standards that the boards must enforce. WDRs are one direct regulation California government agencies use under the Act to regulate NPS pollution."
 Legal framework , California ,"California has a number of other pieces of legislation that address NPS pollution, like the California Coastal Act and the California Environmental Quality Act. There are five primary stakeholders involved in NPS water pollution regulation: government agencies, environmental advocacy groups, potentially regulated entities, and the public. Government stakeholders are government agencies responsible for regulating NPS pollution. In addition to scientific results, agencies are concerned with how new regulations may influence their funding. Environmental advocacy stakeholders are organizations that aim to solve environmental problems, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council. These groups focus on the involvement of concerned citizens."
 Legal framework , California ,"The potentially regulated entities are the industries that will be regulated under new regulation. The public is a key stakeholder group, and various measures have been taken to engage the public on NPS water pollution, including the publication of citizen handbooks on NPS water pollution and online information. Environmental regulations for nonpoint sources must be expressed in directives that are specifically understandable by the regulatory target and enforceable by subsequent government intervention. The legal section above noted a number of policy options that have been used for regulating NPS water pollution."
 Legal framework , California ,"Some of the options include: volunteerism, command and control regulations, incentive based instruments, design standards, emissions limits, product bans, trading systems, subsidies, liability rules, and other options."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Volunteerism ,"Volunteerism mainly depends on polluters' moral constraints and social pressure. Public education and information about nonpoint pollution provide control mechanism. This is a weak, but common, option for NPS regulation when compared to other regulatory options. It is weak because it doesn't require any action be taken; it relies on polluters taking action themselves."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Command and control ,"Command and control policies are direct government regulations. The CWA is designed with this kind of direct command and control regulation for point source pollution. However, command and control regulations through the CWA apply to nonpoint source pollution a lesser extent. TMDLs are one tool in the CWA that directly regulates NPS effluent. As noted earlier, the CWA requires state governments to set TMDLs based on both point source and NPS effluent. However, conventional command and control policies could potentially influence industry structure and cause political reluctance in the event that it could bankrupt businesses."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Economic incentives ,"Incentive based instruments include performance incentives, like taxes on nonpoint pollution sources; design incentives, like subsidies on inputs and control technology; market-based approaches, like trading and/or abatement allowances. Economic incentives are frequently used to control NPS pollution, and include things like the CWA section 319 and 208 grants. Below, different economic incentives are listed along with explanations and how they apply to NPS pollution."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Design standards or technology specifications ,"These types of regulations specify how a certain plant, piece of machinery, or pollution control apparatus should be designed. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have written numerous design standards on the assumption that a particular technology exists whose performance can meet the regulations. A regulatory target may prudently decide its safest course to compliance is to install that technology. Design-based standards are widely applied to agricultural nonpoint sources, including BMPs on cropland. For example, there can be a mandatory establishment of riparian buffer strips between the cropland and neighboring water bodies."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Design standards or technology specifications ,"There are also restrictions on where and at what rates agricultural chemicals can be applied to crops. Design based standards require an effective measurement approach, like BMPs, while performance standards limit pollutant discharges to a specified amount."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Performance standards or emission limits ,"Performance standards or emission limits are types of regulations that set an objective or performance level for the regulatory target to meet. What makes these regulatory approaches unique is that they do not specify how the polluter must meet the standard. These regulations can include emission limits that specify the rate, amount, and kinds of pollutants that may be emitted from a given source over a specific period. The EPA's various effluent limitations for water pollution under the CWA are simply a few of the many environmental regulations that are nominally performance standards."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Product bans and use limitations ,"These prohibit a product or activity or limit its use. Product bans and limitations apply to NPS pollution through restrictions on things like chemicals, pesticides, and food additives. For example, farmers were banned from using the insecticide DDT in 1972 for their crops because it was found to be harmful to humans and wildlife."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Marketable allowances and trading system ,"Marketable allowances are a regulatory approach that allows companies to buy and sell pollution rights. This type of regulation uses market forces to ensure that pollution is reduced in the least costly manner to the polluter. Under a marketable allowance system, there is a presumption that permits will be traded to those companies which have the highest pollution abatement costs. These companies would then sell their allowances to other companies for whom such reductions would be more expensive. Auctions to effectively allocate resources, like public pollution control expenses, could increase competition and maximize revenues in private markets for pollution control."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Marketable allowances and trading system ,This mechanism could also be used to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of government programs. This mechanism provides better market-based information to allocate resources effectively with lower cost. The societal goal is to reduce pollution rather than to avoid paying for unsuccessful pollution control projects. Auctions for public pollution control expenses could be a way to deal with some of the most intractable sources of pollution including nonpoint pollution sources.
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Marketable allowances and trading system ,"The government could accept bids based on units of cost per units of pollution reduced and it could pay based on proof of actual pollution reductions based on a performance measurement.An optimal economical trading ratio for tradable permits, such as through the NPDES program, can define allowable loading amounts for polluters with permits. The number of polluters then becomes the key factor for this instrument. Based on the stochastic nature of nonpoint pollution, NPDES permit system for point sources can not simply be used on nonpoint sources."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Marketable allowances and trading system ,"Although many literature reviews mention tradable permits between point sources and nonpoint sources, unfortunately, current economic literature provides little guidance as to how to set trading ratios. Important factors like environmental risk and relative contributions to ambient pollution are critical to designing the appropriate ratio."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Pollution taxes or emission charges ,"Typical policy remedies such as Pigovian taxes cannot address the issue of non-point source pollution. Such policies require direct monitoring of pollution at the individual polluter level. This is, by definition of pollution being non-point source, infeasible. The economics literature has many alternative policy remedies however. These alternative policies try to apply the polluter pays principle but basing the tax on what can be observed. Things that a tax can be based on include, the use of dirty inputs, a proxy for individual emissions, or some measure of ambient pollution level."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Pollution taxes or emission charges ,"In the case of agriculture, one basis for NPS controls would be to tax farmers based on the amount of erosion they cause. However, measuring erosion and topsoil is expensive. Another way is to impose special purpose district property taxes on farmland that does not adopt BMPs or employ methods to reduce nonpoint source pollution.Another option is to tax farmers based on the amount of fertilizer and pesticides they use. Taxes on pesticides, however, would be limited by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) which takes into account economic impacts."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Pollution taxes or emission charges ,"However, a tax on pesticides would only reduce one source of agricultural NPS pollution and would ignore other important sources, such as livestock waste runoff from Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). Research done by Segerson ""demonstrated that taxes-based approaches on ambient water quality can achieve an efficient level of nonpoint pollution, with a uniform tax appropriate for heterogeneous farmers only when marginal benefits of abating pollution are constant."" When marginal damages from pollution are uncertain, a cost-effectiveness approach is often the most useful framework. The most cost-effective policy is one that has the smallest deadweight loss in achieving certain policy goals."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Pollution taxes or emission charges ,"One case study in Salinas Valley in California shows a water-only tax at about $0.21/mm-ha would achieve a 20% reduction, cost roughly $138 in tax payment; a nitrogen-only tax at $0.76/kg associated with a tax bill of $79 could also achieve a 20% reduction."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Subsidies ,"Subsidies are the converse of taxes. Corporate investments beneficial to the environment can be encouraged by providing companies with public funds, tax breaks, or other benefits to subsidize such activities. In the past, subsidies frequently promoted environmentally destructive activities. Elimination of such subsidies can be a means to promote environmental protections. However, subsidy programs are not without problems. They are often difficult to revise or abandon, may result in a free-rider effect, and may have unintended effects that negate some benefits The federal government has provided a number of subsidies to state NPS programs."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Subsidies ,"The CZMA, for example, provides funds for state coastal NPS programs."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Deposit refund systems ,"A deposit-refund system for contaminants like pesticides, which is similar to current programs for beverage containers could potentially reduce uncontrolled disposal, over-use, and recycling for pesticides. For example, the retail dealer could pay a deposit when purchasing pesticides, and pass the deposit to consumers, who could receive a refund when he or she returned the container to dealers."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Liability rules and insurance requirements ,"Some statutes strengthen common law rules imposing liability for environmental damage. Regulations issued under other statutes are intended to increase the effectiveness of liability rules by requiring that facilities seeking permits to handle hazardous materials have sufficient insurance or other resources to pay for potential damage caused by their activities. Liability guides compensation when polluters are sued. Liability could be strict (pay for any damages), or negotiable with the victims. However, private lawsuits are a difficult way to resolve nonpoint source pollution because it is difficult to prove NPS pollution was the proximate cause of damages."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Liability rules and insurance requirements ,"The inability to trace nonpoint sources could greatly weaken the effectiveness of liability. Agriculture is a major source for nonpoint pollution sources, including nutrients, sediments, pesticides and salts, etc. Disaster insurance for agricultural sector could be necessary for preventing nonpoint pollution based on its characteristics. The uncertainty associate with nonpoint pollution may demand an ""insurance policy"" to protect water quality."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Information and education ,"A number of policies have been developed that are intended to inform regulators and private citizens as to how NPS effluent can be better controlled. One example is with the CZMA mentioned earlier, the EPA is required to provide states with a listing of BMPs for controlling NPS coastal pollution. BMPs are state-of-the-art methods to treat NPS pollution. There is no shortage of BMPs to reduce NPS pollution. For agriculture, examples of BMPs include: conservation easements, cover crops, drainage management, grid sampling, manure injection, manure staging, reduced tillage practices, rotational grazing, and two stage ditches."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Information and education ,"The obvious problem with educational and informational tools, however, is there is no guarantee they will be implemented."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Other potential policy instruments for nonpoint pollution ,"To evaluate these tools' potential, some economic, distributional and political characteristics should be considered: economic performance, administration and enforcement costs, flexibility, incentives for innovation and political feasibility. Challenge regulation or environmental contracting could also be applied. With challenge regulation, the government could establish a clear environmental performance target, while the regulated community could design and implement a program for achieving it. Environmental contracting involved an agreement between a government agency and a source to waive certain regulatory requirements in return for an enforceable commitment to achieve superior performances."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Other potential policy instruments for nonpoint pollution ,Nonpoint source controls are difficult to coordinate because they are usually administered by local rather than state government. Local governments do not have an incentive to adopt nonpoint source controls because their nonpoint pollution usually is exported elsewhere. Another problem is the pervasiveness of nonpoint pollution. A major strategy controls nonpoint pollution at the source by reducing surface runoff through the use of BMPs. BMPs are fragmented and difficult to coordinate because of the great variety in nonpoint sources and because they are administered by local governments.
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Other potential policy instruments for nonpoint pollution ,"Another obstacle to control nonpoint pollution is that the nonpoint source may be unable to internalize the cost of the control or pass it on to consumers. Besides, policy instruments and policy combination should have strong legal enforcement like liability to insure transparency in transaction and prevent failure in market based instruments. Characteristics of NPS and the differences from point source pollution indicated stricter and powerful control mechanism should be applied."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Other potential policy instruments for nonpoint pollution ,"Market-based approaches, design-based approaches, and command and control could be useful, and a policy tool combination or best suit tool depends on particular problem, local condition and policy goal, as well as costs and budget would be desired. The ultimate goal for controlling nonpoint pollution is to maximize environmental benefits, especially in some environmental sensitive areas, degraded areas, critical habitats for endangered species. The baseline for nonpoint pollution abatement should be attending acceptable water quality. Collaboration among agencies is necessary."
 Policy instruments and regulatory approaches , Other potential policy instruments for nonpoint pollution ,"Federal agencies involved in nonpoint pollution control include the Natural Resources Conservation Service, US Forest Service, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Bureau of Land Management and the Army Corps of Engineers. Effective management of NPS pollution requires a partnership among state, federal, local agencies as well as private interests and the public. Coordination among existing programs, especially governmental spending programs, should be performance objectives."

 Purpose ,,"The purpose of the Warren County PCB landfill, as the public knew it, was to bury 60,000 tons of PCB-contaminated soil that had been contaminated with toxic PCBs between June and August, 1978, by Robert J. Burns, a business associate with Robert ""Buck"" Ward of the Ward PCB Transformer Company of Raleigh, North Carolina. Burns and his sons deliberately dripped 31,000 gallons of PCB-contaminated oil along some 240 miles of highway shoulders in 14 counties. Burns of Jamestown, New York, was supposed to take the oil to a facility to be recycled."
 Purpose ,,"Allegedly, the rationale for Burns' crime was that he wanted to save money by circumventing new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations that would make waste disposal more transparent and costly. But he could have easily, discreetly, and illegally disposed of the PCB-contaminated oil in a matter of hours. Burns and Ward were sent to prison for a short time for their involvement in the crime. The Ward Transformer site would later go onto the EPA Superfund cleanup list and be the primary polluter of Lake Crabtree and the Neuse River basin in the vicinity of Raleigh, North Carolina."
 Purpose ,,"Contaminants from the Ward site have been detoxified, but the area around the site and surrounding creeks, lakes, and rivers have been permanently polluted. Soon after the ""midnight PCB dumpings,"" the state erected large warning signs along the roadsides, making the public feel as if the roadside PCBs posed an imminent public health threat. However, the Hunt administration let the PCBs remain for four years as they spread into the environment, while Warren County citizens opposed the PCB landfill."
 Purpose ,,"The Governor, the North Carolina General Assembly, and the EPA found they would have to make the political, legal, and regulatory preparations to forcibly bury the PCBs in Warren County. The Warren County PCB landfill was permitted as a ""dry-tomb"" toxic waste landfill by the EPA under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The EPA approved the ""dry-tomb"" PCB landfill which failed from the beginning because it was capped with nearly a million gallons of water in it."
 Purpose ,,"The site never operated as a commercial facility because residents forced the Governor to include in the deed that it was a one-time only toxic waste facility. The landfill was built with plastic liners, a clay cap, and PVC pipes which allowed for methane and toxic gas to be released from the landfill. Although state officials told citizens they planned to build the landfill with a perforated pipe leachate collection system under the landfill, a system critical to a functioning ""dry-tomb"" landfill, no such leachate collection system was ever installed."
 Purpose ,,"The nearly 1 million gallons of water that was capped in the ""dry-tomb"" landfill could not be pumped out, and citizens later learned from state rainfall and landfill monitoring data that tens of thousands of gallons of water had been entering and exiting the landfill for years. Within a few months of burying the PCBs, EPA found significant PCB air emissions at the landfill and 1/2 mile away, but citizens did not learn about this report for another 15 years. The 60,000 tons of PCB-contaminated soil were buried within about 7 feet of groundwater. Warren County's first independent scientist, Dr."
 Purpose ,,"Charles Mulchi, had predicted that the landfill would inevitably fail because of unsuitable soils and close proximity to groundwater. He had pointed out at a January 4, 1979, EPA public hearing that state scientists had misrepresented the depths of soil sample testing they had conducted at the site. At Mulchi's insistence, the state added a plastic top liner to the landfill. According to detoxification expert Dr."
 Purpose ,,"Joel Hirshhorn, who represented Warren County citizens as they pressed Governor Hunt and the North Carolina General Assembly for funding for a cleanup, the Warren county PCB landfill was an utter failure that should never have been approved by the EPA. Beginning with Governor Hunt's administration's December 20, 1978, announcement that ""public sentiment would not deter the state from burying the PCBs in Warren County,"" the PCB landfill was surrounded by controversy. The landfill was located in rural Warren County, which was primarily African American. Warren County has about 18,000 people living in the county."
 Purpose ,,"Sixty-nine percent of the residents are non-white, and twenty percent of the residents live below the federal poverty level. The county has been determined as a Tier I county for economic development. The residence of the poor and predominantly African-American Warren County, North Carolina opposed the development there of a landfill designed to contain large quantities of soil contaminated with PCBs. Although the coalition lost the battle to stop the landfill, the protesters obtained numerous concessions from the state over the years."
 Purpose ,,"The state claimed that the Warren County site was the best available site; however, the site selection process was not based on scientific criteria — soil permeability properties or the distance to groundwater — but on other, less tangible criteria, including the demographics of the county. EPA and state officials claimed they could compensate for improper soil qualities and the close proximity to groundwater with the engineering design of their ""state-of-the-art"", ""dry-tomb"", zero-percent discharge landfill. An article from 1996 said, “North Carolina’s PCB landfill in Warren County leaks about a half an inch of water a year”."
 Purpose ,,"State data on rainfall during 1996 and water levels inside the dump indicate 30,000 gallons of water flow into the site each year and 26,000 gallons flow out. During this time it is said that citizens and some members of the working group urge Governor Hunt to clean up the dump and detoxify the PCB contaminated soil. The PCBs came from dirt roads in the state where the chemical was dumped illegally in the 70s.After four years, Warren County citizens officially launched the environmental justice movement as they lay in front of 10,000 truckloads of contaminated PCB soil."
 Purpose ,,"During the six-week trucking opposition, with collective nonviolent direct action, which included over 550 arrests, Warren County citizens mounted what the Duke Chronicle described as ""the largest civil disobedience in the South since Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., marched through Alabama."" It was the first time in American history that citizens were jailed for trying to stop a landfill, from attempting to prevent pollution."
 Purpose ,,"In an editorial titled ""Dumping on the Poor,"" The Washington Post described Warren County's PCB protest movement as ""the marriage of environmentalism with civil rights,"" and in its 1994 Environmental Equity Draft, the EPA described the PCB protest movement as ""the watershed event that led to the environmental equity movement of the 1980's."" With public pressure mounting, Governor Hunt then pledged to Warren citizens that when technology became available, the state would detoxify the PCB landfill."
 Purpose ,,"The resulting controversy led to the coining of the phrase ""environmental racism"" and galvanized the environmental justice movement.Soon after, academics and scholars began research and case studies to provide further evidence linking poor in minority neighborhoods across the country with a higher level of environmental hazards. The Warren County protest led the commission of racial justice to produce ""Toxic Waste and Race"", the first national study to correlate waste facilities sites and demographic characteristics. Race was found to be the most potent variable in predicting where these facilities were located; more powerful than poverty, land values, and home ownership."
 Purpose ,,"In May, 1993, more than 10 years after the Governor promised to detoxify the PCB landfill when it became feasible, and soon after stopping a huge trash landfill to be located near the PCB landfill, citizens learned that there was ""an emergency"" at the PCB landfill because of nearly a million gallons of water in that landfill that threatened to breach the liner."

 Purpose ,,"In 1999, the North Carolina General Assembly promised about eight million dollars to go towards cleanup with another group would be willing to match it. The EPA was deemed a ""match"" and the cleanup project was able to move forward. In November 2000 an environmental engineering firm, Earth Tech, was hired to serve as the oversight contractor. In December 2000, public bids were taken for the site-detoxifying contract. The IT group was awarded the contract, with their bid of 13.5 million dollars. Phase I of the cleanup process began, and the contract was signed in March 2001."
 Purpose ,,"The IT group was bought by the Shaw Group, in May 2002, and changed their name to Shaw Environmental and Infrastructure. The equipment was sent to the landfill in May 2002, and an open house was held so community members could view the site before the start-up. The follow-up tests on the site were performed in 2002. The EPA demonstrated test onto the PCB Landfill in January 2003. Based on the test results, an interim operations permit was granted in March."
 Purpose ,,"The soil treatment was then completed in October 2003, and in total 81,600 tons of soil was treated for the landfill site. The soil which was treated was the soil that was on the roadside and the soil adjacent to it that had been in the landfill and had been cross-contaminated. The equipment at the site was decontaminated and removed from the site at the end of 2003. The final cost of the cleanup project of the landfill was 17.1 million dollars. (Much of this money paid for various costly studies and administrative costs."
 Purpose ,,It was not the price of the actual detoxification.) The Based Catalyzed Decomposition detoxification was completed in 2004. Decades after the initial incident the state of North Carolina was required to spend over $25 million to clean up and detoxify the Warren County PCBs landfill.

 History ,,"The Hudson Valley has long been considered the birthplace of the modern American environmental movement. In the 1960s, a small group of scientists, fishermen, and concerned citizens led by Robert H. Boyle, author of The Hudson River, A Natural and Unnatural History and a senior writer at Sports Illustrated, were determined to reverse the decline of the then-polluted Hudson River by confronting the polluters through advocacy and citizen law enforcement. In 1983, HRFA hired John Cronin.In 2000, eight of the 22 members of Riverkeeper's board resigned after Robert F. Kennedy Jr."
 History ,,"insisted on rehiring William Wegner, a scientist whom the organization's then-president, Boyle, had fired as soon as he had learned Wegner had been hired six months earlier. In 1995, Wegner had been convicted of smuggling rare bird eggs from Australia and had also pled guilty to tax evasion. Boyle and the board members who resigned believed it was not right for an environmental organization to hire someone convicted of environmental crimes, especially since critics would not hesitate to publicize that fact to gain a publicity advantage. Treasurer John Fry, who also resigned, felt it would hurt the organization's fundraising."
 History ,,"Boyle was also further displeased that Kennedy had made an employment decision, since that was solely his responsibility within the organization. Kennedy, who had hired Wegner to work for him personally after Boyle had fired him, said Wegner had done ""terrific work"" for Riverkeeper and no one, even those who had resigned over the hiring, disputed that. ""We all make mistakes in our lives,"" he told The New York Times. ""Where would any of us be if we didn't get a second chance?"" As of 2017 Wegner remains employed by Riverkeeper."
 History , Opposition to nuclear power ,"Riverkeeper has advocated for the closure of the Indian Point nuclear power plant. Riverkeeper argued that the power plant killed fish by taking in river water for cooling and that the power plant could cause ""apocalyptic damage"" if attacked by terrorists. Riverkeeper argued that the electricity provided by Indian Point could be fully replaced by renewable energy. After the closure, carbon emissions from electricity generation in New York state increased by 37% and the share of fossil fuel energy in the electric grid increased by 90%."
 History , Opposition to hydropower ,"In 2022, Riverkeeper called on New York to reject a $3 billion clean energy plan that would have supplied New York City with hydropower and lessened New York's reliance on fossil fuels. Riverkeeper opposed the hydropower plan, saying ""This is not emission-free power."" Riverkeeper's position was in stark contrast with many other environmental and clean-energy advocates who argued that the plan was needed to shift the region towards greener energy."
 History , Opposition to hydropower ,"Riverkeeper argued that construction of hydropower dams have adverse environment effects, but the hydropower station that New York was set to use had already been constructed which meant that most of the upfront environmental impact had already occurred.

 Background ,,"In August 1964, Velsicol Chemical Corporation acquired 242 acres (0.98 km2) of rural land in Hardeman County, Tennessee. Velsicol used the site as a landfill for by-products from the production of chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides at its Memphis, Tennessee, chemical manufacturing facility. Before Velsicol purchased the landfill site and commenced depositing chemicals into the ground, it neither conducted hydrogeological studies to assess the soil composition underneath the site, the water flow direction, and the location of the local water aquifer, nor drilled a monitoring well to detect and record any ongoing contamination."
 Background ,,"From October, 1964, to June, 1973, the defendant deposited a total of 300,000 55-gallon steel drums containing ultrahazardous liquid chemical waste and hundreds of fiber board cartons containing ultrahazardous dry chemical waste in the landfill. Shortly after Velsicol began its disposal operations at the landfill site, local residents and county, state, and federal authorities became concerned about the environmental impact of their activities. As a result of this concern, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), in 1967, prepared the first of several reports on the potential contamination effects of the chemicals deposited into the landfill up to that time."
 Background ,,"The 1967 report indicated that chlorinated hydrocarbons had migrated down into the subsoil and had contaminated portions of the surface and subsurface environment adjacent to the disposal site. While the chemicals had not reached the local water aquifer, the USGS concluded that both the local and contiguous ground water were in danger of contamination. State authorities increasingly became concerned about Velsicol's disposal of ultrahazardous chemicals at the site. In 1972, the state filed an administrative action to close the landfill because the chlorinated hydrocarbons buried at the site allegedly were contaminating irreparably the subsurface waters."
 Background ,,"The state ordered Velsicol to cease disposal of all toxic chemicals by August 21, 1972, and all other chemicals by June 1, 1973. In 1978, forty-two plaintiffs sued Velsicol in the Circuit Court of Hardeman County, Tennessee, for damages and an injunction. The complaint sought $1.5 billion in compensatory damages and $1 billion in punitive damages. Velsicol had the case moved to the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, seeking a diversity of citizens based on the amount of damages being sought. All but fifteen of the original forty-two plaintiffs then settled their claims."
 Background ,,"Plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended complaint for damages and an injunction and added forty-seven new plaintiffs to the original lawsuit. The complaint sought relief for involuntary exposure to certain chemical substances known to cause cancer, affect the central nervous system and permanently damage other organs of the human body, and for loss of value to their real property in the region affected by the chemicals. The district court found Velsicol liable to the plaintiffs on legal theories of strict liability, common law negligence, trespass, and nuisance."
 Background ,,"The court concluded that the defendant's hazardous chemicals, which escaped from its landfill and contaminated plaintiffs' well water, were the proximate cause of the representative plaintiffs' injuries. The district court awarded the five individuals compensatory damages totaling $5,273,492.50 for their respective injuries, plus prejudgment interest dating back to July, 1965, of $8,964,973.25. All damages, except for $48,492.50 to one plaintiff for property damage claims, were awarded for personal injuries. The district court also awarded $7,500,000 in punitive damages to the class as a whole."
 Background ,,"Velsicol appealed the decision to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on the basis that the District Court certified the case as a class action under Rule 23(b)(3). Velsicol argued that individual issues, such as proximate cause and damages, predominated over common issues, so that the District court erred in its classification. The Appeals Court ruled that as long as the defendant's liability can be determined on a class-wide basis because the cause of the disaster is a single course of conduct which is identical for each of the plaintiffs."
 Background ,,"The Appeals Court reversed the District court's decision to defer its award punitive damages prior to determining compensatory damages for the entire class of 128 individuals; and remanded the recomputation of punitive damages It was determined that spent hydrocarbons buried at the landfill disposal site included not only chlorobenzene, hexachlorobutadiene, hexachloroethane, hexachloronorbornadiene, naphthalene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, hexachlorocyclopentadiene, and benzene, but also the known carcinogens carbon tetrachloride and chloroform."
 Background ,,"The drums and cartons containing these chemicals were deposited in trenches that were 15 feet (4.6 m) deep and 12 to 15 feet (4.6 m) wide and covered with approximately 3 feet (0.91 m) of soil. Velsicol took no precautions to insure the drums from bursting and, invariably, some of the drums would leak their contents into the soil. Furthermore, the trenches were neither lined nor covered with any impermeable material to prevent the chemical waste from leaking into the soil."
 Background ,,"Velsicol eventually placed a clay cap over the landfill site in 1980 only after state authorities threatened a lawsuit over the imminent danger the landfill posed to the environment.

 History ,,"The Stream Protection Rule updated the regulations issued by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) to implement Title V of the 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), the focus of which were the conditions for issuing permits to begin a mining operation. The regulations had been issued in 1979, updated in 1983, and litigation over mountaintop removal mining required changes to the regulations, which were issued in 2008."
 History ,,"Environmental groups challenged the new rules in court and in 2014 a federal court struck them down, and the Obama administration began working on new rules.: 6 In a joint hearing in December 2015, by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and Subcommittee on the Interior, U.S. Representative Brenda Lawrence stated in the reasoning to the Stream Protection Rule that previous rules were not developed with current science and have failed to prevent environmental harm. Current evidence has linked coal mining with loss in stream water quality and ecosystem health."
 History ,,"State regulatory agencies have rarely enacted policy to regulate impact on streams outside of mining sites.In July 2015 as part of the development of the new rules, OSMRE published a draft Environmental Impact Statement about the new rules."

 History ,,"and became effective on January 19, 2017. Part of the work that led to the new rules was a collaboration with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service; the ESA requires federal agencies to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service to ensure their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered or threatened species, or adversely modify critical habitat. The Fish and Wildlife Service published its Programmatic Biological Opinion, and both agencies published a Memorandum of Understanding that described how OSMRE was implementing the findings of the Opinion, on the same day the new rules were published."
 History ,,"Following the law being implemented, the Stream Protection Rule aimed to create ""balance between environmental protection and the nation's need for coal as a source of energy."" To achieve this, the rule included improvements in the protection of water supplies, water quality, streams, fish and other wildlife, and other environmental issues that are harmed by surface coal mining; furthermore, the rule provided mine operators with more regulations that would help avoid water pollution as well as water treatment costs."
 History ,,"In addition to these guidelines, the rule also included eradicating water pollution outside of permit areas, requiring thorough data collection for mining operations, protection and restoration of streams, updated guidelines for protecting endangered species, and long-term treatment of unintentional water contamination. Expanding on permits, the rule also guarantees that science and technology are leveraged to analyze the potential harms of mining. It also ensured that lands that are harmed by mining operations can be restored to a condition comparable to its condition before the mining operation was introduced."
 History ,,"During the restoration process companies would be required to plant native trees and vegetation. 30% of the rule's provisions were revisions and organizational changes that aimed to help ""improve consistency, clarity, accuracy, and ease of use.""Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management, Hon."
 History ,,"Janice Schneider testified before a joint House committee hearing stating ""Every reclamation practice contained in the proposed rule has been successfully implemented by a mine operator somewhere in the country."" and that the rule was based on industry best practice.The Stream Protection Rule covered waterways near surface coal mining operations in order to avoid pollution of rivers and streams, and also called for the restoration of streams that had been damaged by dangerous, heavy metals like mercury and arsenic."
 History ,,"The Rule would have protected an estimated 6,000 miles of streams over the next two decades, by establishing that coal companies were in fact, not allowed to damage the ""hydrologic balance"" outside their permit area and enforcing a 100-foot buffer around streams to preserve native species. The Interior Department had also said that the rule would protect 52,000 acres of forests as a default of keeping coal mining debris away from nearby waters."
 History ,,"On January 11, 2017, a report for members and committees of Congress was published by the Congressional Research Service, entitled ""The Office of Surface Mining's Stream Protection Rule: An Overview."" The report described the history of law, regulation, and litigation that had led to the new rules. The report also summarized a report, Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Stream Protection Rule, that was prepared for the Interior Department's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement."
 History ,,"That draft regulatory impact analysis (RIA) outlined the costs of the new rules to the coal mining industry, and provided an overall cost-benefit analysis of the rules. The draft RIA found that ""added administrative costs resulting from the rule are expected to be small for industry, adding on average about $0.01 per ton of coal mined"", although cost in Appalachia would be expected to be up to $0.04 per ton. Cost for small operators were expected to be higher. The draft RIA cites SMCRA Section 507(c) to assist these operators."
 History ,,"The draft RIA expected administrative cost for government to range from $1,830 to $2,546 per mine depending on the region. The draft RIA found that under the proposed rule, coal production would ""decrease in aggregate by about 1.9 million tons annually, or approximately 0.2% compared with production expected under the baseline,"" reflecting mainly substitution of natural gas for coal by U.S."

 History ,,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had also claimed that the rule would decrease the number of coal-related jobs.When the Stream Protection Rule was published, it was immediately challenged in court by the Republican state attorneys general of several states, as well as the coal mining company Murray Energy."
 History ,,"The states challenging the bill were Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming, all of which are coal-mining states.When the new Congress met in 2017, controlled by Republicans in both houses, a coalition made up of 124 organizations, including Greenpeace, the National Women's Law Center, the Center for Biological Diversity and the AFL–CIO, sent an open letter urging Congress not to overturn the Rule.In early February 2017, Congress voted to use the Congressional Review Act to pass a ""resolution of disapproval"" to revoke the Stream Protection Rule."
 History ,,"The resolution to repeal the bill passed in the House by a 228–194 vote and in the Senate by a vote of 54–45, largely on party lines, with Republicans voting in favor and Democrats voting against. According to the Center for American Progress, the 27 representatives that sponsored or co-sponsored the review of the rules received nearly $500 million from mining interests in 2016. Trump signed H.J. Res 38 on February 16, 2017, overturning the Stream Protection Rule.When he signed the resolution repealing the rule, Trump predicted that striking down the rule would save thousands of U.S. mining-related jobs."
 History ,,"Republican Bill Johnson, the U.S. representative for Ohio's 6th congressional district and sponsor for the disapproval measure, stated, ""Make no mistake about it, this Obama administration rule is not designed to protect streams."

 Overview ,,"The original Trail smelter for the nearby Rossland mines, was founded by the American mining engineer F. Augustus Heinze (1869 – 1914) who had already built a smelter in Butte, Montana. In 1896, Heinze initially incorporated his smelting and mining company in the United States and then in Canada. Within a period of 4 years, Heinze owned the ""smelter, mining interests, railway lines, railway charters, and associated land grants."" Walter Hull Aldridge (b."
 Overview ,,"1867), an American mining and metallurgical engineer, took a position with the president of the Canadian Pacific Railroad (CPR), Sir William Van Horne, to negotiate a deal with Heinze. Under Aldridge's direction, the CPR's mining interests were incorporated under the name of the Consolidated Mining & Smelting Company, then known as the Consolidated or CM&S. At that time, Consolidated ""controlled many of British Columbia's largest lead, silver, gold and copper mines, as well as the large reduction works at Trail.""In 1910, CM&S anticipated the decline of its Rossland mines and purchased the lead-zinc ore-rich Sullivan Mine."
 Overview ,,"At that time, it was difficult to smelt ore from the Sullivan mine because of the presence of iron sulphide."

 Overview ,,"Damages were estimated at $350,000 by the International Joint Commission in 1927.In 1934, Cominco had initiated heavy water research at the smelter but it did not gain momentum until the outbreak of World War II. During the war, the Allies cooperated in researching nuclear fission with the goal of developing an atomic bomb. New research had revealed that heavy water could slow down the uranium neutron, making a chain reaction possible. Under the tenure of Selwyn G. Blaylock as Cominco's president, the smelter was upgraded as part of the Manhattan Project's heavy water production program, under code name the P-9 Project."
 Overview ,,"Princeton University physicist Hugh S. Taylor, who was in charge of United States Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) research on heavy water research, gave Cominco $20,000 towards the upgrade modifications. Cominco produced heavy water for the United States from 1942 until 1956.In the 1950s, a hydroelectric dam—the Waneta Dam—was built south of Trail on the Pend D’Oreille River, which provided inexpensive electricity to the smelter.For decades the smelter provided well-paying employment for people who had only a high school education."
 Overview ,,"Intergenerational families worked at the smelter and the company became Trail's ""economic and cultural centre.""In the spring of 2017, Teck Resources announced that they were considering a CA$1.2-billion deal to sell its Waneta Dam to BC Hydro. At the time, union members who work at the Teck were concerned about the smelter's future. Teck had expanded its operations worldwide and the Trail operations only contributed CA$92 million of Teck's CA$3.3-billion gross profit in 2017. Teck Resources Trail Smelter dispute"
