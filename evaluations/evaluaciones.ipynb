It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.

Contaminated by Pb due to vehicle exhaust, Cd, and Zn caused by tire wear. Contamination by strengthening air pollutants by incineration of fossil raw materials.The most common chemicals involved are petroleum hydrocarbons, solvents, pesticides, lead, and other heavy metals. Any activity that leads to other forms of soil degradation (erosion, compaction, etc.) may indirectly worsen the contamination effects in that soil remediation becomes more tedious. Historical deposition of coal ash used for residential, commercial, and industrial heating, as well as for industrial processes such as ore smelting, were a common source of contamination in areas that were industrialized before about 1960. Coal naturally concentrates lead and zinc during its formation, as well as other heavy metals to a lesser degree. When the coal is burned, most of these metals become concentrated in the ash (the principal exception being mercury). Coal ash and slag may contain sufficient lead to qualify as a \"characteristic hazardous waste\", defined in the US as containing more than 5 mg/L of extractable lead using the TCLP procedure. In addition to lead, coal ash typically contains variable but significant concentrations of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; e.g., benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, indeno(cd)pyrene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and others). These PAHs are known human carcinogens and the acceptable concentrations of them in soil are typically around 1 mg/kg. Coal ash and slag can be recognised by the presence of off-white grains in soil, gray heterogeneous soil, or (coal slag) bubbly, vesicular pebble-sized grains. Treated sewage sludge, known in the industry as biosolids, has become controversial as a \"fertilizer\". As it is the byproduct of sewage treatment, it generally contains more contaminants such as organisms, pesticides, and heavy metals than other soil.In the European Union, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive allows sewage sludge to be sprayed onto land.

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\"Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored.

The EPA first promulgated ELGs for CAFOs in 1976. The 2003 rule issued by the EPA updated and modified the applicable ELGs for CAFOs, among other things. In 2005, the court decision in Waterkeeper Alliance v. EPA (see below) struck down parts of the 2003 rule. The EPA responded by issuing a revised rule in 2008. A complete history of EPA\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s CAFO rulemaking activities is provided on the CAFO Rule History page. ==== Background laws ==== The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 was one of the first major efforts of the U.S. federal government to establish a comprehensive program for mitigating pollution in public water ways. The writers of the act aimed to improve water quality for the circulation of aquatic life, industry use, and recreation. Since 1948, the Act has been amended many times to expand programming, procedures, and standards.President Richard Nixon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s executive order, Reorganization Plan No. 3, created the EPA in 1970. The creation of the EPA was an effort to create a more comprehensive approach to pollution management. As noted in the order, a single polluter may simultaneously degrade a local environment\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s air, water, and land. President Nixon noted that a single government entity should be monitoring and mitigating pollution and considering all effects. As relevant to CAFO regulation, the EPA became the main federal authority on CAFO pollution monitoring and mitigation.Congress passed the CWA in 1972 when it reworked the Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments. It specifically defines CAFOs as point source polluters and required operations managers and/or owners to obtain NPDES permits in order to legally discharge wastewater from its facilities. ==== Initial regulations (1970s) ==== The EPA began regulating water pollution discharges from CAFOs following passage of the 1972 CWA. ELGs for feedlot operations were promulgated in 1974, placing emphasis on best available technology in the industry at the time. In 1976 EPA began requiring all CAFOs to be first defined as AFOs. From that point, if the specific AFO met the appropriate criteria, it would then be classified as a CAFO and subject to appropriate regulation. That same year, EPA defined livestock and poultry CAFO facilities and established a specialized permitting program. NPDES permit procedures for CAFOs were also promulgated in 1976.Prior to 1976, size had been the main defining criteria of CAFOs. However, after the 1976 regulations came into effect, the EPA stipulated some exceptions. Operations that were identified as particularly harmful to federal waterways could be classified as CAFOs, even if the facilities\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' sizes fall under AFOs standards. Additionally, some CAFOs were not required to apply for wastewater discharge permits if they met the two major operational-based exemptions. The first exception applied to operations that discharge wastewater only during a 25-year, 24-hour storm event. (The operation only discharges during a 24-hour rainfall period that occurs once every 25 years or more on average.) The second exception was when operations apply animal waste onto agricultural land. ==== Developments in the 1990s ==== In 1989, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Public Citizen filed a lawsuit against the EPA (and Administrator of the EPA, William Reilly). The plaintiffs claimed the EPA had not complied with the CWA with respect to CAFOs. The lawsuit, Natural Resources Defense Council v. Reilly (D.D.C. 1991), resulted in a court order mandating the EPA update its regulations. They did so in what would become the 2003 Final Rule.In 1995, the EPA released a \"Guide Manual on NPDES Regulations for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations\" to provide more clarity to the public on NPDES regulation after the EPA\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s report \"Feedlots Case Studies of Selected States\" revealed there was uncertainty in the public regarding CAFO regulatory terminology and criteria. Although the document is not a rule, it did offer insight and furthered public understanding of previous rules. In his 1998 Clean Water Action Plan, President Bill Clinton directed the USDA and the EPA to join forces to develop a framework for future actions to improve national water quality standards for public health. The two federal agencies\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' specific responsibility was to improve the management of animal waste runoff from agricultural activities. In 1998, the USDA and the EPA hosted eleven public meetings across the country to discuss animal feeding operations (AFOs).On March 9, 1999, the agencies released the framework titled the Unified National Strategy for Animal Feeding Operations. In the framework, the agencies recommended six major activities to be included in operations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plans (CNMPs): feed management manure handling and storage land application of manure land management record keeping activities that utilize manure.The framework also outlined two types of related programs. First, \"voluntary programs\" were designed to assist AFO operators with addressing public health and water quality problems. The framework outlines three types of voluntary programs available: \"locally led conservation,\" \"environmental education,\" and \"financial and technical assistance.\" The framework explained that those that participate in voluntary programs are not required to have a comprehensive nutrient management plan (CNMP). The second type of program outlined by the framework was regulatory, which includes command-and-control regulation with NPDES permitting.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 1672551, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-23T08:55:35Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"==== Background laws ==== The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 was one of the first major efforts of the U.S. federal government to establish a comprehensive program for mitigating pollution in public water ways.

In fact, Petroleum Ministry OMCs were asked to examine the possibility of introduction of BS VI auto fuels in the whole of NCR area from 1 April 2019.

It may look like a minor problem initially but in the long run, it poses a threat to children and the elderly. Transport is a major land use, leaving less land available for other purposes. Cars also contribute to pollution of air and water.  Though a horse produces more waste, cars are cheaper, thus far more numerous in urban areas than horses ever were. Emissions of harmful gases like carbon monoxide, ozone, carbon dioxide, benzene and particulate matter can damage living organisms and the environment.  The emissions from cars cause disabilities, respiratory diseases, and ozone depletion. Noise pollution from cars can also potentially result in hearing disabilities, headaches, and stress to those frequently exposed to it. In countries such as the United States the infrastructure that makes car use possible, such as highways, roads and parking lots is funded by the government and supported through zoning and construction requirements. Fuel taxes in the United States cover about 60% of highway construction and repair costs, but little of the cost to construct or repair local roads. Payments by motor-vehicle users fall short of government expenditures tied to motor-vehicle use by 20–70 cents per gallon of gas. Zoning laws in many areas require that large, free parking lots accompany any new buildings. Municipal parking lots are often free or do not charge a market rate. Hence, the cost of driving a car in the US is subsidized, supported by businesses and the government who cover the cost of roads and parking. This is in addition to other external costs car users do not pay like accidents or pollution. Even in countries with higher gas taxes like Germany motorists do not fully pay for the external costs they create. This government support of the automobile through subsidies for infrastructure, the cost of highway patrol enforcement, recovering stolen cars, and many other factors makes public transport a less economically competitive choice for commuters when considering out-of-pocket expenses. Consumers often make choices based on those costs, and underestimate the indirect costs of car ownership, insurance and maintenance. However, globally and in some US cities, tolls and parking fees partially offset these heavy subsidies for driving. Transportation planning policy advocates often support tolls, increased fuel taxes, congestion pricing and market-rate pricing for municipal parking as a means of balancing car use in urban centers with more efficient modes such as buses and trains. When cities charge market rates for parking, and when bridges and tunnels are tolled, driving becomes less competitive in terms of out-of-pocket costs. When municipal parking is underpriced and roads are not tolled, most of the cost of vehicle usage is paid for by general government revenue, a subsidy for motor vehicle use. The size of this subsidy dwarfs the federal, state, and local subsidies for the maintenance of infrastructure and discounted fares for public transportation.By contrast, although there are environmental and social costs for rail, there is a very small impact.Walking or cycling often have net positive impacts on society as they help reduce health costs and produce virtually no pollution. A study attempted to quantify the costs of cars (i.e. of car-use and related decisions and activity such as production and transport/infrastructure policy) in conventional currency, finding that the total lifetime cost of cars in Germany is between 0.6 and 1.0 million euros with the share of this cost born by society being between 41% (€4674 per year) and 29% (€5273 per year). This suggests that cars consume \"a large share of disposable income\", creating \"complexities in perceptions of transport costs, the economic viability of alternative transport modes, or the justification of taxes\".\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 298818, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-18T07:36:04Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'According to the Handbook on estimation of external costs in the transport sector made by the Delft University and which is the main reference in European Union for assessing the externalities of cars, the main external costs of driving a car are: congestion and scarcity costs, accident costs, air pollution costs, noise costs, climate change costs, costs for nature and landscape, costs for water pollution, costs for soil pollution and costs of energy dependency.Use of cars for transportation creates barriers by reducing the landscape required for walking and cycling.

It may look like a minor problem initially but in the long run, it poses a threat to children and the elderly. Transport is a major land use, leaving less land available for other purposes. Cars also contribute to pollution of air and water.  Though a horse produces more waste, cars are cheaper, thus far more numerous in urban areas than horses ever were. Emissions of harmful gases like carbon monoxide, ozone, carbon dioxide, benzene and particulate matter can damage living organisms and the environment.  The emissions from cars cause disabilities, respiratory diseases, and ozone depletion. Noise pollution from cars can also potentially result in hearing disabilities, headaches, and stress to those frequently exposed to it. In countries such as the United States the infrastructure that makes car use possible, such as highways, roads and parking lots is funded by the government and supported through zoning and construction requirements. Fuel taxes in the United States cover about 60% of highway construction and repair costs, but little of the cost to construct or repair local roads. Payments by motor-vehicle users fall short of government expenditures tied to motor-vehicle use by 20–70 cents per gallon of gas. Zoning laws in many areas require that large, free parking lots accompany any new buildings. Municipal parking lots are often free or do not charge a market rate. Hence, the cost of driving a car in the US is subsidized, supported by businesses and the government who cover the cost of roads and parking. This is in addition to other external costs car users do not pay like accidents or pollution. Even in countries with higher gas taxes like Germany motorists do not fully pay for the external costs they create. This government support of the automobile through subsidies for infrastructure, the cost of highway patrol enforcement, recovering stolen cars, and many other factors makes public transport a less economically competitive choice for commuters when considering out-of-pocket expenses. Consumers often make choices based on those costs, and underestimate the indirect costs of car ownership, insurance and maintenance. However, globally and in some US cities, tolls and parking fees partially offset these heavy subsidies for driving. Transportation planning policy advocates often support tolls, increased fuel taxes, congestion pricing and market-rate pricing for municipal parking as a means of balancing car use in urban centers with more efficient modes such as buses and trains. When cities charge market rates for parking, and when bridges and tunnels are tolled, driving becomes less competitive in terms of out-of-pocket costs. When municipal parking is underpriced and roads are not tolled, most of the cost of vehicle usage is paid for by general government revenue, a subsidy for motor vehicle use. The size of this subsidy dwarfs the federal, state, and local subsidies for the maintenance of infrastructure and discounted fares for public transportation.By contrast, although there are environmental and social costs for rail, there is a very small impact.Walking or cycling often have net positive impacts on society as they help reduce health costs and produce virtually no pollution. A study attempted to quantify the costs of cars (i.e. of car-use and related decisions and activity such as production and transport/infrastructure policy) in conventional currency, finding that the total lifetime cost of cars in Germany is between 0.6 and 1.0 million euros with the share of this cost born by society being between 41% (€4674 per year) and 29% (€5273 per year). This suggests that cars consume \"a large share of disposable income\", creating \"complexities in perceptions of transport costs, the economic viability of alternative transport modes, or the justification of taxes\".\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 298818, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-18T07:36:04Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'According to the Handbook on estimation of external costs in the transport sector made by the Delft University and which is the main reference in European Union for assessing the externalities of cars, the main external costs of driving a car are: congestion and scarcity costs, accident costs, air pollution costs, noise costs, climate change costs, costs for nature and landscape, costs for water pollution, costs for soil pollution and costs of energy dependency.Use of cars for transportation creates barriers by reducing the landscape required for walking and cycling.

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\"Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored.

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015.

Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health.

The largest emitters are China followed by the United States. The United States has higher emissions per capita. The main producers fueling the emissions globally are large oil and gas companies. Emissions from human activities have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 50% over pre-industrial levels. The growing levels of emissions have varied, but have been consistent among all greenhouse gases. Emissions in the 2010s averaged 56 billion tons a year, higher than any decade before. Total cumulative emissions from 1870 to 2017 were 425±20 GtC (1539 GtCO2) from fossil fuels and industry, and 180±60 GtC (660 GtCO2) from land use change. Land-use change, such as deforestation, caused about 31% of cumulative emissions over 1870–2017, coal 32%, oil 25%, and gas 10%.Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas resulting from human activities. It accounts for more than half of warming. Methane (CH4) emissions have almost the same short-term impact. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases (F-gases) play a lesser role in comparison. Electricity generation, heat and transport are major emitters; overall energy is responsible for around 73% of emissions. Deforestation and other changes in land use also emit carbon dioxide and methane. The largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions is agriculture, closely followed by gas venting and fugitive emissions from the fossil-fuel industry. The largest agricultural methane source is livestock. Agricultural soils emit nitrous oxide partly due to fertilizers. Similarly, fluorinated gases from refrigerants play an outsized role in total human emissions. The current CO2-equivalent emission rates averaging 6.6 tonnes per person per year, are well over twice the estimated rate 2.3 tons required to stay within the 2030 Paris Agreement increase of 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over pre-industrial levels. Annual per capita emissions in the industrialized countries are typically as much as ten times the average in developing countries. The carbon footprint (or greenhouse gas footprint) serves as an indicator to compare the amount of greenhouse gases emitted over the entire life cycle from the production of a good or service along the supply chain to its final consumption.

Emissions from human activities have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 50% over pre-industrial levels. The growing levels of emissions have varied, but have been consistent among all greenhouse gases. Emissions in the 2010s averaged 56 billion tons a year, higher than any decade before. Total cumulative emissions from 1870 to 2017 were 425±20 GtC (1539 GtCO2) from fossil fuels and industry, and 180±60 GtC (660 GtCO2) from land use change. Land-use change, such as deforestation, caused about 31% of cumulative emissions over 1870–2017, coal 32%, oil 25%, and gas 10%.Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas resulting from human activities. It accounts for more than half of warming. Methane (CH4) emissions have almost the same short-term impact. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases (F-gases) play a lesser role in comparison. Electricity generation, heat and transport are major emitters; overall energy is responsible for around 73% of emissions. Deforestation and other changes in land use also emit carbon dioxide and methane. The largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions is agriculture, closely followed by gas venting and fugitive emissions from the fossil-fuel industry. The largest agricultural methane source is livestock. Agricultural soils emit nitrous oxide partly due to fertilizers. Similarly, fluorinated gases from refrigerants play an outsized role in total human emissions. The current CO2-equivalent emission rates averaging 6.6 tonnes per person per year, are well over twice the estimated rate 2.3 tons required to stay within the 2030 Paris Agreement increase of 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over pre-industrial levels. Annual per capita emissions in the industrialized countries are typically as much as ten times the average in developing countries. The carbon footprint (or greenhouse gas footprint) serves as an indicator to compare the amount of greenhouse gases emitted over the entire life cycle from the production of a good or service along the supply chain to its final consumption. Carbon accounting (or greenhouse gas accounting) is a framework of methods to measure and track how much greenhouse gas an organization emits.\\', \\'WikipageID\\': 9528025, \\'LastModified\\': \\'2023-12-25T04:33:50Z\\', \\'split\\': \\'Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities intensify the greenhouse effect.

Volcanic emissions vary significantly in composition, and have complex chemistry due to the presence of ash particulates and a wide variety of other elements in the plume. Only stratovolcanoes containing primarily felsic magmas are responsible for these fluxes, as mafic magma erupted in shield volcanoes doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t result in plumes which reach the stratosphere. However, before the Industrial Revolution, dimethyl sulfide pathway was the largest contributor to sulfate aerosol concentrations in a more average year with no major volcanic activity. According to the IPCC First Assessment Report, published in 1990, volcanic emissions usually amounted to around 10 million tons in 1980s, while dimethyl sulfide amounted to 40 million tons. Yet, by that point, the global human-caused emissions of sulfur into the atmosphere became \"at least as large\" as all natural emissions of sulfur-containing compounds combined: they were at less than 3 million tons per year in 1860, and then they increased to 15 million tons in 1900, 40 million tons in 1940 and about 80 millions in 1980. The same report noted that \"in the industrialized regions of Europe and North America, anthropogenic emissions dominate over natural emissions by about a factor of ten or even more\". In the eastern United States, sulfate particles were estimated to account for 25% or more of all air pollution. Meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere had much lower concentrations due to being much less densely populated, with an estimated 90% of the human population in the north. In the early 1990s, anthropogenic sulfur dominated in the Northern Hemisphere, where only 16% of annual sulfur emissions were natural, yet amounted for less than half of the emissions in the Southern Hemisphere. Such an increase in sulfate aerosol emissions had a variety of effects. At the time, the most visible one was acid rain, caused by precipitation from clouds carrying high concentrations of sulfate aerosols in the troposphere. At its peak, acid rain has eliminated brook trout and some other fish species and insect life from lakes and streams in geographically sensitive areas, such as Adirondack Mountains in the United States. Acid rain worsens soil function as some of its microbiota is lost and heavy metals like aluminium are mobilized (spread more easily)  while essential nutrients and minerals such as magnesium can leach away because of the same. Ultimately, plants unable to tolerate lowered pH are killed, with montane forests being some of the worst-affected ecosystems due to their regular exposure to sulfate-carrying fog at high altitudes. While acid rain was too dilute to affect human health directly, breathing smog or even any air with elevated sulfate concentrations is known to contribute to heart and lung conditions, including asthma and bronchitis. Further, this form of pollution is linked to preterm birth and low birth weight, with a study of 74,671 pregnant women in Beijing finding that every additional 100 µg/m3 of SO2 in the air reduced infants\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' weight by 7.3 g, making it and other forms of air pollution the largest attributable risk factor for low birth weight ever observed. ==== Control measures ==== Due largely to the US EPA\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Acid Rain Program, the U.S. has had a 33% decrease in emissions between 1983 and 2002 (see table). This improvement resulted in part from flue-gas desulfurization, a technology that enables SO2 to be chemically bound in power plants burning sulfur-containing coal or petroleum. In particular, calcium oxide (lime) reacts with sulfur dioxide to form calcium sulfite: CaO + SO2 →  CaSO3Aerobic oxidation of the CaSO3 gives CaSO4, anhydrite.  Most gypsum sold in Europe comes from flue-gas desulfurization. To control sulfur emissions, dozens of methods with relatively high efficiencies have been developed for fitting of coal-fired power plants. Sulfur can be removed from coal during burning by using limestone as a bed material in fluidized bed combustion.Sulfur can also be removed from fuels before burning, preventing formation of SO2 when the fuel is burnt. The Claus process is used in refineries to produce sulfur as a byproduct.  The Stretford process has also been used to remove sulfur from fuel. Redox processes using iron oxides can also be used, for example, Lo-Cat or Sulferox.Fuel additives such as calcium additives and magnesium carboxylate may be used in marine engines to lower the emission of sulfur dioxide gases into the atmosphere.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 50958, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-20T08:42:33Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"At its peak, acid rain has eliminated brook trout and some other fish species and insect life from lakes and streams in geographically sensitive areas, such as Adirondack Mountains in the United States.

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.

It is not emitted directly by car engines or by industrial operations, but formed by the reaction of sunlight on air containing hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides that react to form ozone directly at the source of the pollution or many kilometers downwind. Ozone reacts directly with some hydrocarbons such as aldehydes and thus begins their removal from the air, but the products are themselves key components of smog. Ozone photolysis by UV light leads to production of the hydroxyl radical HO• and this plays a part in the removal of hydrocarbons from the air, but is also the first step in the creation of components of smog such as peroxyacyl nitrates, which can be powerful eye irritants. The atmospheric lifetime of tropospheric ozone is about 22 days; its main removal mechanisms are being deposited to the ground, the above-mentioned reaction giving HO•, and by reactions with OH and the peroxy radical HO2•.There is evidence of significant reduction in agricultural yields because of increased ground-level ozone and pollution which interferes with photosynthesis and stunts overall growth of some plant species. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a secondary regulation to reduce crop damage, in addition to the primary regulation designed for the protection of human health. ==== Low level ozone in urban areas ==== Certain examples of cities with elevated ozone readings are Denver, Colorado; Houston, Texas; and Mexico City, Mexico. Houston has a reading of around 41 nmol/mol, while Mexico City is far more hazardous, with a reading of about 125 nmol/mol.Low level ozone, or tropospheric ozone, is the most concerning type of ozone pollution in urban areas and is increasing in general. Ozone pollution in urban areas affects denser populations, and is worsened by high populations of vehicles, which emit pollutants NO2 and VOCs, the main contributors to problematic ozone levels. Ozone pollution in urban areas is especially concerning with increasing temperatures, raising heat-related mortality during heat waves. During heat waves in urban areas, ground level ozone pollution can be 20% higher than usual. Ozone pollution in urban areas reaches higher levels of exceedance in the summer and autumn, which may be explained by weather patterns and traffic patterns. People experiencing poverty are more affected by pollution in general, even though these populations are less likely to be contributing to pollution levels.As mentioned above, Denver, Colorado, is one of the many cities in the U.S. that have high amounts of ozone. According to the American Lung Association, the Denver–Aurora area is the 14th most ozone-polluted area in the U.S. The problem of high ozone levels is not new to this area. In 2004, the EPA allotted the Denver Metro/North Front Range as non-attainment areas per 1997\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s 8-hour ozone standard, but later deferred this status until 2007. The non-attainment standard indicates that an area does not meet the EPA\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s air quality standards. The Colorado Ozone Action Plan was created in response, and numerous changes were implemented from this plan. The first major change was that car emission testing was expanded across the state to more counties that did not previously mandate emissions testing, like areas of Larimer and Weld County. There have also been changes made to decrease Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions, which should help lower ozone levels. One large contributor to high ozone levels in the area is the oil and natural gas industry situated in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJB) which overlaps with a majority of Colorado\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s metropolitan areas. Ozone is created naturally in the Earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s stratosphere, but is also created in the troposphere from human efforts. Briefly mentioned above, NOx and VOCs react with sunlight to create ozone through a process called photochemistry. One hour elevated ozone events (<75 ppb) \"occur during June–August indicating that elevated ozone levels are driven by regional photochemistry\". According to an article from the University of Colorado-Boulder, \"Oil and natural gas VOC emission have a major role in ozone production and bear the potential to contribute to elevated O3 levels in the Northern Colorado Front Range (NCFR)\". Using complex analyses to research wind patterns and emissions from large oil and natural gas operations, the authors concluded that \"elevated O3 levels in the NCFR are predominantly correlated with air transport from N– ESE, which are the upwind sectors where the O&NG operations in the Wattenberg Field area of the DJB are located\".Contained in the Colorado Ozone Action Plan, created in 2008, plans exist to evaluate \"emission controls for large industrial sources of NOx\" and \"statewide control requirements for new oil and gas condensate tanks and pneumatic valves\". In 2011, the Regional Haze Plan was released that included a more specific plan to help decrease NOx emissions. These efforts are increasingly difficult to implement and take many years to come to pass. Of course there are also other reasons that ozone levels remain high. These include: a growing population meaning more car emissions, and the mountains along the NCFR that can trap emissions. If interested, daily air quality readings can be found at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s website. As noted earlier, Denver continues to experience high levels of ozone to this day. It will take many years and a systems-thinking approach to combat this issue of high ozone levels in the Front Range of Colorado. ==== Ozone cracking ==== Ozone gas attacks any polymer possessing olefinic or double bonds within its chain structure, such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber, and styrene-butadiene rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, the rate of crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. Ozone cracking used to be a serious problem in car tires, for example, but it is not an issue with modern tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like gaskets and O-rings, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. Fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking. The commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 22718, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-25T16:03:55Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'Low level ozone (or tropospheric ozone) is an atmospheric pollutant.

Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million.

Although there are many effects of noise pollution, two specific consequences are adjustments in population distribution and modified animal communication. Birds provide a clear example of both of these consequences. Altered population distributions can affect inter-species interactions. For example, the diversity of birds in the woodlands of New Mexico was significantly reduced in areas with unnatural noise levels. This change in diversity resulted in less nest predation, which was explained by the decreased presence of the dominant predator - the scrub-jay. This effect has also been observed in owls. A negative correlation was found between the noise intensity of an area and the probability that a long-eared owl will reside in that region. Suggested explanations for this outcome are that hunting efficiency was diminished and communication was less effective. Noise pollution also affects conspecific communication. High noise levels may require animals to adjust their vocalizations in order for communication to remain effective. Bird songs are a well-studied component of animal communication. The use of adjusted songs was observed in Savannah sparrows residing in noisy environments. Adjusted songs were so distinct that their use in the control environment did not result in responses (i.e. aggressive territorial behaviour) typically observed when non-adjusted songs were vocalized. Failure to recognize conspecific vocalizations can also be detrimental to male-male competition. Male urban white-crowned sparrows approached stimulus songs of intruders more closely, regardless of song type, when in the presence of noise pollution. A higher frequency of harmful fights is a suggested consequence of this behaviour because of the relatively small distance between the intruding and defending males. ==== Marine animals ==== Noise pollution can also affect marine animals. There are many sources of noise in the world\\\\\\'s oceans, such as the sounds produced by commercial shipping, sonars and acoustic deterrents. Unnatural noise levels can negatively affect reproductive behaviour, such as courtship behaviours. For example, painted goby males did not take part in visual courtship behaviour when in a noisy environment. Female painted gobies in this experiment were also less likely to spawn in a noisy environment. Noise pollution can also affect foraging behaviour in marine animals, which results in less effective strategies. Porpoises have been found to make fewer prey capture attempts, dive deeper, and cut their foraging behaviour short when a vessel passes by, which results in a higher energy expenditure.  Shore crabs were also observed interrupting their foraging behaviour when in the presence of ship noise. Antipredator behaviour in marine animals has also been known to change when noise levels are high. Shore crabs took longer to return to their shelters when in the presence of ship noise. Neolamprologus pulcher (a cichlid fish) females defended their nest less against predators when boat noise was present. ==== Recommendations for marine animals ==== Specific mitigation strategies and recommendations have been presented by the Marine Mammal Commission (2007). They offer multiple ways to alleviate noise pollution in the ocean. Some strategies include removing the source of noise, employing sound attenuation devices, limiting the use of the sound source and monitoring operational requirements. They recommend improving research programs, creating consistent regulation standards that are better enforced and improving mitigation strategies.\", \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 56304602, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-05-14T09:29:23Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'==== Birds ==== Noise pollution is widespread, which is mostly a result of transportation networks.

There are a variety of natural underwater sounds produced by waves in coastal and shelf habitats, and biotic communication signals that do not negatively impact the ecosystem. The changes in behavior of invertebrates vary depending on the type of anthropogenic noise and is similar to natural noisescapes.Experiments have examined the behavior and physiology of the clam (Ruditapes philippinarum), the decapod (Nephrops norvegicus), and the brittlestar (Amphiura filiformis) that are affected by sounds resembling shipping and building noises. The three invertebrates in the experiment were exposed to continuous broadband noise and impulsive broadband noise. The anthropogenic noise impeded the bioirrigation and burying behavior of Nephrops norvegicus. In addition, the decapod exhibited a reduction in movement. Ruditapes philippinarum experienced stress which caused a reduction in surface relocation. The anthropogenic noise caused the clams to close their valves and relocate to an area above the interface of the sediment-water. This response inhibits the clam from mixing the top layer of the sediment profile and hinders suspension feeding. Sound causes Amphiura filiformis to experience changes in physiological processes which results in irregularity of bioturbation behavior.These invertebrates play an important role in transporting substances for benthic nutrient cycling. As a result, ecosystems are negatively impacted when species cannot perform natural behaviors in their environment. Locations with shipping lanes, dredging, or commercial harbors are known as continuous broadband sound. Pile-driving, and construction are sources that exhibit impulsive broadband noise. The different types of broadband noise have different effects on the varying species of invertebrates and how they behave in their environment.Another study found that the valve closures in the Pacific oyster Magallana gigas was a behavioral response to varying degrees of acoustic amplitude levels and noise frequencies. Oysters perceive near-field sound vibrations by utilizing statocysts. In addition, they have superficial receptors that detect variations in water pressure. Sound pressure waves from shipping can be produced below 200Hz. Pile driving generates noise between 20 and 1000 Hz. In addition, large explosions can create frequencies ranging from 10 to 200Hz. M. gigas can detect these noise sources because their sensory system can detect sound in the 10 to < 1000Hz range.The anthropogenic noise produced by human activity has been shown to negatively impact oysters. Studies have revealed that wide and relaxed valves are indicative of healthy oysters. The oysters are stressed when they do not open their valves as frequently in response to environmental noise. This provides support that the oysters detect noise at low acoustic energy levels. While we generally understand that marine noise pollution influences charismatic megafauna like whales and dolphins, understanding  how invertebrates like oysters perceive and respond to human generated sound can provide further insight about the effects of anthropogenic noise on the larger ecosystem. The aquatic ecosystems are known to use sound to navigate, find food, and protect themselves. In 2020, one of the worst mass stranding of whales occurred in Australia. Experts suggest that noise pollution plays a major role in the mass stranding of whales.Noise pollution has also altered avian communities and diversity. Anthropogenic noises have a similar effect on bird population as seen in marine ecosystems, where noises reduce reproductive success; cannot detect predators due to interferences of anthropogenic noises, minimize nesting areas, increase stress response, and species abundances and richness declining. Certain avian species are more sensitive to noises compared to others, resulting in highly-sensitive birds migrating to less disturbed habitats. There has also been evidence of indirect positive effects of anthropogenic noises on avian populations. It was found that nesting bird predators, such as the western scrub-jay (Aphelocoma californica), were uncommon in noisy environments (western scrub-jay are sensitive to noise). Therefore, reproductive success for nesting prey communities was higher due to the lack of predators. Noise pollution can alter the distribution and abundance of prey species, which can then impact predator populations.\\', \\'WikipageID\\': 66599, \\'LastModified\\': \\'2023-12-27T06:40:19Z\\', \\'split\\': \\'The aquatic ecosystems are known to use sound to navigate, find food, and protect themselves.

Two scenarios are possible. A broad reading would be interpreted as knocking out all section 404 jurisdiction and Corps regulation of isolated waters and wetlands. However, a narrow reading, one asserting that jurisdiction will be found lacking only if the sole connection to interstate commerce is the presence of migratory birds and wildlife, would allow federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue (such as in waters that are used by interstate travelers for recreation). The question of which view the government would take was answered in a January 19 memorandum issued jointly by EPA and the Corps for headquarters and field/regional staff who work on the section 404 program, discussed above; the agencies provide a legal interpretation, based on a narrow reading of the Court\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s decision. A key policy question that may not be clearly answered for some time is how regulatory protection of wetlands will be affected or reduced as a result of the decision. Many types of isolated wetlands are not physically adjacent to navigable waters and under a broad reading of the decision, would lack regulation. Major wetland types that potentially would not be regulated include prairie potholes of the Upper Midwest, wet meadows, river fringing wetlands along small non-navigable rivers and streams, lake fringing wetlands for smaller non-navigable lakes, many forested wetlands, playas and vernal ponds of Texas and other areas of the west, seeps and spring, flats, bogs and large amounts of tundra in Alaska. A new report by the Department of Interior\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that in 1997, there were 105,500,000 acres (427,000 km2) of wetlands on public and private lands in the conterminous United States and that between 1986 and 1997, a net of 644,000 acres (2,610 km2) of wetlands was lost. According to an analysis prepared by the Association of State Wetland Managers (ASWM), accurate estimates of impacts of the decision on wetland resources are not possible, in part because of uncertainty about how key terms in the opinion (such as \"adjacent\" and \"tributary\") will be defined, whether broadly or narrowly. Still, ASWM believes that impacts are likely to be environmentally significant. Tentative state estimates which have been provided to the Association of State Wetland Managers suggest 30% to 79% of total wetland acreage may be   affected.... Even if SWANCC results in only a one percent loss of America\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s wetlands, the decision would cause more wetlands to be destroyed than were lost in the past decade.Scientists recognize the value of wetlands on the basis of a range of physical functions that they perform. One group of functions relates to water quality. Wetlands are good water filters: they remove and retain nutrients, they process chemical and organic wastes, and they reduce sediment loads to receiving waters. Wetlands also provide flood damage protection to urban and agricultural lands by storing flood waters that overflow river banks or surface waters and by collecting waters in isolated depressions. Wetlands recharge groundwater reserves that are hydrological: connected to surface waters. According to a 1995 National Research Council report, many of these functions occur irrespective of whether the wetlands are isolated or contiguous to navigable waters because of groundwater connections between isolate) wetlands and surface waters. Small, shallow wetlands that are isolated from rivers are frequently important to waterfowl, the NRC said, for food and forage. Also, sites that are intermittently flooded, even those that may be completely dry for several years, can be important for storing flood waters and can have distinctive water-dependent biota (plants and animals) that persist over dry intervals but return when water return to the site.The SWANCC decision affects not only privately owned lands but also isolated waters and wetlands on public lands: the federal government owns about one- third of the nation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s lands. As a result of the Court\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s decision, federal agency decisions on these lands affecting isolated wetlands will no longer be subject to section 404 permitting, but they will still be subject to requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and Executive Orders dealing with wetlands, floodplain management, and protection of migratory birds. In addition to the section 404 program, questions arise about impacts of the SWANCC ruling on other parts of the CWA, especially its principal permit program, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program under section 402. It requires permits for pollutant discharges from point sources (industrial facilities and municipal sewage plants) into the nation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s waters. Another provision, section 311, concerns liability for oil discharges into the nation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s waters. Neither was at issue in this case but might be challenged through extension of the ruling. The January 19 joint Corps-EPA memorandum states that federal implementation of any other CWA provision that involves \"waters of the United States\" will be governed by the same interpretation that applies to section 404. As a result, federal jurisdiction to require NPDES permits or assess oil spill liability in some isolated waters could be limited. Such impacts will become clearer in time.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 23451176, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-09-13T03:05:59Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"Even if SWANCC results in only a one percent loss of America\\\\\\'s wetlands, the decision would cause more wetlands to be destroyed than were lost in the past decade.Scientists recognize the value of wetlands on the basis of a range of physical functions that they perform.

Studies have shown that restored wetlands can become productive CO2 sinks and many restoration projects have been enacted in the US and around the world. Aside from climate benefits, wetland restoration and conservation can help preserve biodiversity, improve water quality, and aid with flood control.The plants that make up wetlands absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and convert it into organic matter. The waterlogged nature of the soil slows down the decomposition of organic material, leading to the accumulation of carbon-rich peat, acting as a long-term carbon sink. Additionally, anaerobic conditions in waterlogged soils hinder the complete breakdown of organic matter, promoting the conversion of carbon into more stable forms.As with forests, for the sequestration process to succeed, the wetland must remain undisturbed. If it is disturbed somehow, the carbon stored in the plants and sediments will be released back into the atmosphere and the ecosystem will no longer function as a carbon sink. Additionally, some wetlands can release non-CO2 greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide which could offset potential climate benefits. The amounts of carbon sequestered via blue carbon by wetlands can also be difficult to measure.Wetlands are created when water overflows into heavily vegetated soil causing plants to adapt to a flooded ecosystem. Wetlands can occur in three different regions. Marine wetlands are found in shallow coastal areas, tidal wetlands are also coastal but are found farther inland, and non-tidal wetlands are found inland and have no effects from tides. Wetland soil is an important carbon sink; 14.5% of the world\\\\\\'s soil carbon is found in wetlands, while only 5.5% of the world\\\\\\'s land is composed of wetlands. Not only are wetlands a great carbon sink, they have many other benefits like collecting floodwater, filtering air and water pollutants, and creating a home for numerous birds, fish, insects, and plants.Climate change could alter soil carbon storage changing it from a sink to a source. With rising temperatures comes an increase in greenhouse gasses from wetlands especially locations with permafrost. When this permafrost melts it increases the available oxygen and water in the soil. Because of this, bacteria in the soil would create large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane to be released into the atmosphere.The link between climate change and wetlands is still not fully known. It is also not clear how restored wetlands manage carbon while still being a contributing source of methane. However, preserving these areas would help prevent further release of carbon into the atmosphere. ==== Peatlands, mires and peat bogs ==== Peatlands hold approximately 30% of the carbon in our ecosystem. When they are drained for agricultural land and urbanization, because peatlands are so vast, large quantities of carbon decompose and emit CO2 into the atmosphere. The loss of one peatland could potentially produce more carbon than 175–500 years of methane emissions.Peat bogs act as a sink for carbon because they accumulate partially decayed biomass that would otherwise continue to decay completely. There is a variance on how much the peatlands act as a carbon sink or carbon source that can be linked to varying climates in different areas of the world and different times of the year.  By creating new bogs, or enhancing existing ones, the amount of carbon that is sequestered by bogs would increase.\", \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 4535852, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-20T15:54:40Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"Wetland restoration involves restoring a wetland\\\\\\'s natural biological, geological, and chemical functions through re-establishment or rehabilitation.

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.

Much of this research is on the long term effects of nuclear power plants on lakes after a nuclear power plant has been removed. Overall, there is support for thermal pollution leading to an increase in water temperatures. When power plants are active, short term water temperature increases are correlated with electrical needs, with more coolant released during the winter months. Water warming has also been seen to persist in systems for long periods of time, even after plants have been removed.When warm water from power plant coolant enters systems, it often mixes leading to general increases in water temperature throughout the water body, including deep cooler water. Specifically in lakes and similar water bodies, stratification leads to different effects on a seasonal basis. In the summer, thermal pollution has been seen to increase deeper water temperature more dramatically than surface water, though stratification still exists, while in the winter surface water temperatures see a larger increase. Stratification is reduced in winter months due to thermal pollution, often eliminating the thermocline.A study looking at the effect of a removed nuclear power plant in Lake Stechlin, Germany, found a 2.33°C increase persisted in surface water during the winter and a 2.04°C increase persisted in deep water during the summer, with marginal increases throughout the water column in both winter and summer. Stratification and water temperature differences due to thermal pollution seem to correlate with nutrient cycling of phosphorus and nitrogen, as oftentimes water bodies that receive coolant will shift toward eutrophication. No clear data has been obtained on this though, as it is difficult to differentiate influences from other industry and agriculture.Similar to effects seen in aquatic systems due to climatic warming of water, thermal pollution has also been seen to increase surface temperatures in the summer. This can create surface water temperatures that lead to releases of warm air into the atmosphere, increasing air temperature. It therefore can be seen as a contributor to global warming. Many ecological effects will be compounded by climate change as well, as ambient temperature rises in water bodies.Spacial and climatic factors can impact the severity of water warming due to thermal pollution. High wind speeds tend to increase the impact of thermal pollution. Rivers and large bodies of water also tend to lose the effects of thermal pollution as they progress from the source.Rivers present a unique problem with thermal pollution. As water temperatures are elevated upstream, power plants downstream receive warmer waters. Evidence of this effect has been seen along the Mississippi River, as power plants are forced to use warmer waters as their coolants. This reduces the efficiency of the plants and forces the plants to use more water and produce more thermal pollution.\\', \\'WikipageID\\': 1732697, \\'LastModified\\': \\'2023-08-20T13:38:34Z\\', \\'split\\': \\'Water warming effects, as opposed to water cooling effects, have been the most studied with regard to biogeochemical effects.

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\"Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored.

It is also possible for light at night to be both beneficial and damaging for a species.  As an example, humans benefit from using indoor artificial light to extend the time available for work and play, but the light disrupts the human circadian rhythm, and the resulting stress is damaging to health.Through the various effects that light pollution has on individual species, the ecology of regions is affected.  In the case where two species occupy an identical niche, the population frequency of each species may be changed by the introduction of artificial light if they are not equally affected by light at night.  For example, some species of spiders avoid lit areas, while other species willingly build webs directly on lamp posts. Since lamp posts attract many flying insects, the spiders that tolerate light gain an advantage over the spiders that avoid it, and may become more dominant in the environment as a result.  Changes in these species frequencies can then have knock-on effects, as the interactions between these species and others in the ecosystem are affected and food webs are altered. These ripple effects can eventually affect diurnal plants and animals. As an example, changes in the activity of night active insects can change the survival rates of night blooming plants, which may provide food or shelter for diurnal animals.

In the case where two species occupy an identical niche, the population frequency of each species may be changed by the introduction of artificial light if they are not equally affected by light at night.  For example, some species of spiders avoid lit areas, while other species willingly build webs directly on lamp posts. Since lamp posts attract many flying insects, the spiders that tolerate light gain an advantage over the spiders that avoid it, and may become more dominant in the environment as a result.  Changes in these species frequencies can then have knock-on effects, as the interactions between these species and others in the ecosystem are affected and food webs are altered. These ripple effects can eventually affect diurnal plants and animals. As an example, changes in the activity of night active insects can change the survival rates of night blooming plants, which may provide food or shelter for diurnal animals. The introduction of artificial light at night is one of the most drastic anthropogenic changes to the Earth, comparable to toxic pollution, land use change, and climate change due to increases in the concentration of green house gases.\\', \\'split_id\\': 0, \\'tokens\\': 430}}\"]']\n",

During the 1970s, mangroves occupied as much as 200,000 km2, encompassing approximately 75% of the world\\\\\\'s coastlines. Now, global mangrove area has experienced significant decline where at least 35% has been lost. Mangroves are continuing to diminish at a rate of 1-2% per year. Much of this lost mangrove area was destroyed to make room for industry, housing and tourism development; for aquaculture, primarily shrimp farms; and for agriculture, such as rice paddies, livestock pasture and salt production. Other drivers of mangrove forest destruction include activities that divert their sources of freshwater, such as groundwater withdrawals, the building of dams, and the building of roads and drainage canals across tidal flats. Another indirect human activity, climate change, also threatens mangrove habitat. Sea levels are on the rise as polar ice caps melt from increasing temperatures and thermal expansion. Depending on sediment accumulation, mangrove habitats will generally respond to sea level change in three different ways: (1) If the sediment in the mangrove forest rises faster than the sea level, plants from further inland may move into the area as the mangroves retreat; (2) if the rate of sediment accumulation is equal to the rate of sea level rise, the forest survives and is stable during this period and (3) if the rate of soil accumulation is slower than the rate of sea level rise, the mangrove forest will be submerged by the sea. However, mangroves may then adapt and spread more inland as new territory is made for mangrove habitat. It is important to note that changes may deviate from these three general scenarios depending on local morphological/topographical features. However, there are limits to the capacity of mangroves to adapt to climate change. It is projected that a 1-meter rise in sea level could inundate and destroy mangrove forests in many regions around the globe. Mangroves play a vital role in delivering essential ecosystem services for the benefit of both humans and wildlife. The loss of these invaluable services will have a significant negative impact on the world. Mangrove habitat loss leaves coastal communities vulnerable to the risks of flooding, shoreline erosion, saline intrusion, and increased storm activity. Ecosystem services such as water purification and  collection of raw materials are not possible if mangroves are utilized unsustainably. Furthermore, the decline of mangrove communities heavily impacts the plants and animals that rely on the habitat for survival. Loss of mangroves leads to reduced water quality, reduced biodiversity, increased sedimentation threatening coral reefs, and collapse of intertidal food webs and aquatic nurseries. Since mangroves are carbon sinks, their destruction can release large amounts of stored carbon and contribute to the effects of global warming.\", \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 36309813, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-25T04:10:03Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"The issue of restoration is critical today since mangrove forests are being lost very quickly – at an even faster rate than tropical rainforests inland.

Coal includes contaminants such as sulfur compounds and non-combustible minerals. When coal is burned, the minerals become ash (i.e. particulate matter or PM), and the sulfur forms sulfur dioxide (SO2). Since air is mostly nitrogen, the combustion of coal often leads to the production of nitrogen oxides. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are the primary causes of acid rain. For many years—before greenhouse gasses were widely understood to be a threat—it was thought that these by-products were the only drawback to using coal. These by-products are still a problem, but they have been greatly diminished in most advanced countries due to clean air regulations. It is possible to remove most of the sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) emissions from the coal-burning process. For example, various techniques are used in a coal preparation plant to reduce the amount of non-combustible matter (i.e. ash) in the coal before burning. During combustion, fluidized bed combustion is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. After burning, particulate matter (i.e. ash and dust) can be reduced using an electrostatic precipitator, and sulfur dioxide emissions can be further reduced with flue-gas desulfurization. Trace amounts of radionuclides are more difficult to remove.[citation neededCoal-fired power plants are the largest aggregate source of the toxic heavy metal mercury: 50 tons per year come from coal power plants out of 150 tons emitted nationally in the US and 5000 tons globally. However, according to the United States Geological Survey, the trace amounts of mercury in coal by-products do not pose a threat to public health. A study in 2013 found that mercury found in the fish in the Pacific Ocean could possibly be linked to coal-fired plants in Asia.[citation needed] ==== Coal pollution produces smog ==== A visibly persistent example of the effects of pollution from burning coal is the “smog and soot which had serious health impacts on residents of growing urban centers.” Smog is a colloid that is formed when sunlight reacts with gaseous nitrogen oxides and at least one volatile organic compound (VOC) latent within the atmosphere. Smog is often visible to the naked human eye, and exists as a hazy, white smoke sometimes causing acute irritation of the eyes, nose, and respiratory system. The two main sources that cause smog are primary and secondary pollution. Primary pollution is emitted directly from a source, such as driving a car, burning coal, burning fossil fuels, etc., whereas secondary pollution is formed in the atmosphere, such as natural chemical reactions between sunlight and ozone.

Meanwhile, in some countries, such as Turkey, they are only reported to the government, not the public. However, since the late 2010s satellite measurements of some pollutants have been available. ==== Greenhouse gasses ==== Combustion of coal —a sedimentary rock composed primarily of carbon— produces carbon dioxide. According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the burning of coal, a fossil fuel, is a significant contributor to global warming. (See the UN IPCC Fourth Assessment Report). Burning 1 ton of coal produces 2.86 tons of carbon dioxide. Carbon sequestration technology, to remove significant quantities of carbon dioxide from the air, has yet to be tested on a large scale and may not be safe or successful. Sequestered CO2 may eventually leak up through the ground, may lead to unexpected geological instability or may cause contamination of aquifers used for drinking water supplies.[citation needed] Carbon capture and storage is applied at large point emitters of carbon dioxide with the objective of preventing it from entering the atmosphere.

According from the Water and Air Pollution  \"The great smog of 1952 was caused by the mass production of burning coal, killing 4,000 people in londonWater and Air Pollution, and in “1948 there was severe industrial air pollution created deadly smog that asphyxiated 20 people in Donora Pennsylvania and made 7,000 more people sick.” ==== Measurement of pollution and availability of pollution data ==== In some countries, such as the EU, smokestack measurements from individual power plants must be published. \\\\\\', \\\\\\'split_id\\\\\\': 3, \\\\\\'tokens\\\\\\': 338}}\\']']\n",

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.

The majority of this waste (80%) comes from land-based activity, although marine transportation significantly contributes as well.  It is a combination of chemicals and trash, most of which comes from land sources and is washed or blown into the ocean. This pollution results in damage to the environment, to the health of all organisms, and to economic structures worldwide. Since most inputs come from land, either via the rivers, sewage or the atmosphere, it means that continental shelves are more vulnerable to pollution. Air pollution is also a contributing factor by carrying off iron, carbonic acid, nitrogen, silicon, sulfur, pesticides or dust particles into the ocean. The pollution often comes from nonpoint sources such as agricultural runoff, wind-blown debris, and dust. These nonpoint sources are largely due to runoff that enters the ocean through rivers, but wind-blown debris and dust can also play a role, as these pollutants can settle into waterways and oceans. Pathways of pollution include direct discharge, land runoff, ship pollution, bilge pollution, atmospheric pollution and, potentially, deep sea mining. The types of marine pollution can be grouped as pollution from marine debris, plastic pollution, including microplastics, ocean acidification, nutrient pollution, toxins and underwater noise. Plastic pollution in the ocean is a type of marine pollution by plastics, ranging in size from large original material such as bottles and bags, down to microplastics formed from the fragmentation of plastic material. Marine debris is mainly discarded human rubbish which floats on, or is suspended in the ocean. Plastic pollution is harmful to marine life. Another concern is the runoff of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from intensive agriculture, and the disposal of untreated or partially treated sewage to rivers and subsequently oceans. These nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients (which are also contained in fertilizers) stimulate phytoplankton and macroalgal growth, which can lead to harmful algal blooms (eutrophication) which can be harmful to humans as well as marine creatures. Excessive algal growth can also smother sensitive coral reefs and lead to loss of biodiversity and coral health. A second major concern is that the degradation of algal blooms can lead to consumption of oxygen in coastal waters, a situation that may worsen with climate change as warming reduces vertical mixing of the water column.Many potentially toxic chemicals adhere to tiny particles which are then taken up by plankton and benthic animals, most of which are either deposit feeders or filter feeders. In this way, the toxins are concentrated upward within ocean food chains. When pesticides are incorporated into the marine ecosystem, they quickly become absorbed into marine food webs. Once in the food webs, these pesticides can cause mutations, as well as diseases, which can be harmful to humans as well as the entire food web. Toxic metals can also be introduced into marine food webs. These can cause a change to tissue matter, biochemistry, behavior, reproduction, and suppress growth in marine life. Also, many animal feeds have a high fish meal or fish hydrolysate content.

Air Pollution: This occurs when harmful substances such as gases, particles, or other contaminants are released into the atmosphere, causing negative impacts on human health and the environment. Sources of air pollution include industrial activities, vehicle emissions, and natural sources like wildfires.\n",

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.

Any activity that leads to other forms of soil degradation (erosion, compaction, etc.) may indirectly worsen the contamination effects in that soil remediation becomes more tedious. Historical deposition of coal ash used for residential, commercial, and industrial heating, as well as for industrial processes such as ore smelting, were a common source of contamination in areas that were industrialized before about 1960. Coal naturally concentrates lead and zinc during its formation, as well as other heavy metals to a lesser degree. When the coal is burned, most of these metals become concentrated in the ash (the principal exception being mercury). Coal ash and slag may contain sufficient lead to qualify as a \"characteristic hazardous waste\", defined in the US as containing more than 5 mg/L of extractable lead using the TCLP procedure. In addition to lead, coal ash typically contains variable but significant concentrations of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; e.g., benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, indeno(cd)pyrene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and others). These PAHs are known human carcinogens and the acceptable concentrations of them in soil are typically around 1 mg/kg. Coal ash and slag can be recognised by the presence of off-white grains in soil, gray heterogeneous soil, or (coal slag) bubbly, vesicular pebble-sized grains. Treated sewage sludge, known in the industry as biosolids, has become controversial as a \"fertilizer\". As it is the byproduct of sewage treatment, it generally contains more contaminants such as organisms, pesticides, and heavy metals than other soil.In the European Union, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive allows sewage sludge to be sprayed onto land. The volume is expected to double to 185,000 tons of dry solids in 2005. This has good agricultural properties due to the high nitrogen and phosphate content. In 1990/1991, 13% wet weight was sprayed onto 0.13% of the land; however, this is expected to rise 15 fold by 2005.  Advocates say there is a need to control this so that pathogenic microorganisms do not get into water courses and to ensure that there is no accumulation of heavy metals in the top soil.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 4229946, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-14T12:18:39Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'Soil pollution can be caused by the following (non-exhaustive list) : Microplastics Oil spills Mining and activities by other heavy industries Accidental spills may happen during activities, etc. Corrosion of underground storage tanks (including piping used to transmit the contents) Acid rain Intensive farming Agrochemicals, such as pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers Petrochemicals Industrial accidents Road debris Construction activities Exterior lead-based paints Drainage of contaminated surface water into the soil Ammunitions, chemical agents, and other agents of war Waste disposal Oil and fuel dumping Nuclear wastes Direct discharge of industrial wastes to the soil Discharge of sewage Landfill and illegal dumping Coal ash Electronic waste Contaminated by rocks containing large amounts of toxic elements.

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health.

Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.

This form of pollution can lead to many problems, such as the degradation of aquatic ecosystems or spreading water-borne diseases when people use polluted water for drinking or irrigation. Another problem is that water pollution reduces the ecosystem services (such as providing drinking water) that the water resource would otherwise provide. Sources of water pollution are either point sources or non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause, such as a storm drain, a wastewater treatment plant or an oil spill. Non-point sources are more diffuse, such as agricultural runoff. Pollution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. Pollution may take the form of toxic substances (e.g., oil, metals, plastics, pesticides, persistent organic pollutants, industrial waste products), stressful conditions (e.g., changes of pH, hypoxia or anoxia, increased temperatures, excessive turbidity, changes of salinity), or the introduction of pathogenic organisms. Contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. Control of water pollution requires appropriate infrastructure and management plans as well as legislation. Technology solutions can include improving sanitation, sewage treatment, industrial wastewater treatment, agricultural wastewater treatment, erosion control, sediment control and control of urban runoff (including stormwater management).\\', \\'WikipageID\\': 312266, \\'LastModified\\': \\'2023-12-16T18:40:07Z\\', \\'split\\': \\'Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities, so that it negatively affects its uses.:\\\\\\\\u200a6\\\\\\\\u200a Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater.

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\"Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored.

      "Air pollution is a significant environmental issue that affects the health and well-being of individuals worldwide. To address this problem, it's essential to understand the main causes of air pollution and adopt practical solutions to reduce emissions. Here are some effective ways to minimize air pollution:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Strategic substitution: One approach is to replace high-emission sources with lower-emission or emission-free alternatives. For instance, switching from fossil fuel vehicles to electric or hybrid vehicles can significantly reduce transportation emissions. Additionally, using public transport, bicycles, and other non-motorized modes of transport can help minimize air pollution.\n",
      "2. Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles: A critical component of a shift to sustainable transport is the phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles. This can be achieved by promoting electric vehicles and investing in alternative energy sources like renewables or nuclear power for electricity generation.\n",
      "3. Alternative fuels: Using cleaner fuels like natural gas, hydrogen, or biofuels can reduce emissions from ships, heavy-duty vehicles, and other equipment. These alternatives may not be practical yet, but they offer a promising solution to air pollution.\n",
      "4. Aviation biofuel: Mixing aviation biofuel with jet fuel at a 50/50 ratio can reduce particulate emissions from aircraft by 50-70%, according to a NASA-led study in 2017. This solution can help improve air quality, especially downwind of major airports.\n",
      "5. Heating and home stoves: In poor countries, heating and cooking with cleaner fuels like natural gas or renewables can replace traditional biomass burning stoves, which contribute significantly to regional air pollution.\n",
      "6. Ground source heat pumps: Using ground source heat pumps instead of fossil fuel-based heating systems can reduce emissions from space heating. Seasonal thermal energy storage can also help optimize the use of renewable energy sources for heating and cooling.\n",
      "7. Electricity generation: Shifting to cleaner forms of electricity generation, such as nuclear or renewable energy, can reduce emissions from power plants. This approach can be particularly effective in areas with high levels of air pollution due to coal-fired power plants.\n",
      "8. Energy efficiency and conservation: Improving energy efficiency and conserving energy can help reduce overall demand for energy, which can lead to lower emissions. This can be achieved through measures like building insulation, efficient appliances, and smart grid technologies.\n",
      "9. Urban planning and design: Designing cities with clean air in mind can help minimize the impact of air pollution. For example, creating green spaces, promoting walkability, and prioritizing public transport can all contribute to a healthier environment.\n",
      "10. Monitoring and enforcement: Effective monitoring and enforcement of emissions standards are crucial for reducing air pollution. Governments and regulatory agencies must work together to ensure compliance with emissions regulations and penalize non-compliant entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, a multi-faceted approach is necessary to effectively reduce air pollution. By implementing these strategies, we can create a healthier environment for ourselves and future generations.\n",

It's important to note that water pollution is a significant problem in both developing and developed countries, and it can have severe impacts on human health, the environment, and the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several main ways to reduce water pollution:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Wastewater treatment: This involves treating wastewater from households, industries, and agriculture before it is discharged into water bodies. Wastewater treatment can remove harmful chemicals, bacteria, and other pollutants from the water, making it safer for human consumption and aquatic life.\n",
      "2. Source control: This involves identifying and addressing sources of pollution before they enter water bodies. For example, this could involve implementing best management practices in agriculture to prevent fertilizers and pesticides from entering waterways, or installing systems to capture and treat industrial wastewater.\n",
      "3. Water conservation: Reducing the amount of water used can help reduce the amount of pollutants that enter water bodies. This can be achieved through measures such as implementing efficient irrigation systems, fixing leaks in water pipes, and promoting water-saving technologies.\n",
      "4. Stormwater management: Managing stormwater runoff can help prevent pollutants from entering water bodies. This can involve installing rain gardens, constructing wetlands, or using permeable pavements to allow rainfall to infiltrate the ground instead of running off into waterways.\n",
      "5. Education and outreach: Raising awareness about the importance of protecting water resources and the impacts of pollution can help engage communities in efforts to reduce water pollution. This can involve educating farmers about best management practices for agricultural runoff, or teaching children about the importance of protecting local waterways.\n",
      "6. Regulatory measures: Governments can play a crucial role in reducing water pollution by implementing regulations and standards that limit the amount of pollutants that can be discharged into water bodies. This can include setting limits on the amount of nutrients, pathogens, or other pollutants that are allowed in wastewater discharge.\n",
      "7. Technological innovation: Developing new technologies to treat and monitor water quality can help reduce water pollution.

The United Nations Framework for Sustainable Development Goals recognizes the damaging effects of eutrophication in marine environments and has established a timeline for creating an Index of Coastal Eutrophication and Floating Plastic Debris Density (ICEP) within Sustainable Development Goal 14.\n",
      "\n",
      "To reduce land pollution, there are several main ways to minimize the causes of eutrophication:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sustainable Agricultural Practices: Implementing sustainable agricultural practices such as crop rotation, organic farming, and reducing the use of synthetic fertilizers can help reduce soil erosion, nutrient pollution, and land degradation. These practices also promote healthy soil and water conservation.\n",
      "2. Forest Conservation: Protecting forest cover helps prevent soil erosion, reduces the amount of sediment entering watersheds, and filters out pollutants before they reach a body of water. This can be achieved through sustainable forestry practices, reforestation efforts, and preserving natural habitats.\n",
      "3. Waste Disposal Technology: Implementing efficient waste disposal technology such as recycling facilities, composting programs, and proper landfill management can help reduce the amount of pollutants entering watersheds. This includes reducing the use of single-use plastics, which contribute to marine debris and eutrophication.\n",
      "4. Controlled Land Use: Using sustainable agricultural practices such as contour farming, terracing, and maintaining vegetative buffers along waterways can help reduce soil erosion and nutrient pollution. These practices also promote healthy soil and water conservation.\n",
      "5. Collaboration and Education: Cooperation between different organizations, including state governments, water resource management agencies, non-governmental organizations, and local communities is essential to prevent eutrophication. Educating the public about the importance of proper waste disposal and sustainable agricultural practices can also help reduce land pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, the Chesapeake Bay is one of the most well-known inter-state efforts to prevent eutrophication. By implementing these strategies, we can work together towards achieving SDG 14's target to significantly reduce marine pollution from land-based activities by 2025.\n",

The EPA first promulgated ELGs for CAFOs in 1976. The 2003 rule issued by the EPA updated and modified the applicable ELGs for CAFOs, among other things. In 2005, the court decision in Waterkeeper Alliance v. EPA (see below) struck down parts of the 2003 rule. The EPA responded by issuing a revised rule in 2008. A complete history of EPA\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s CAFO rulemaking activities is provided on the CAFO Rule History page. ==== Background laws ==== The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 was one of the first major efforts of the U.S. federal government to establish a comprehensive program for mitigating pollution in public water ways. The writers of the act aimed to improve water quality for the circulation of aquatic life, industry use, and recreation. Since 1948, the Act has been amended many times to expand programming, procedures, and standards.President Richard Nixon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s executive order, Reorganization Plan No. 3, created the EPA in 1970. The creation of the EPA was an effort to create a more comprehensive approach to pollution management. As noted in the order, a single polluter may simultaneously degrade a local environment\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s air, water, and land. President Nixon noted that a single government entity should be monitoring and mitigating pollution and considering all effects. As relevant to CAFO regulation, the EPA became the main federal authority on CAFO pollution monitoring and mitigation.Congress passed the CWA in 1972 when it reworked the Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments. It specifically defines CAFOs as point source polluters and required operations managers and/or owners to obtain NPDES permits in order to legally discharge wastewater from its facilities. ==== Initial regulations (1970s) ==== The EPA began regulating water pollution discharges from CAFOs following passage of the 1972 CWA. ELGs for feedlot operations were promulgated in 1974, placing emphasis on best available technology in the industry at the time. In 1976 EPA began requiring all CAFOs to be first defined as AFOs. From that point, if the specific AFO met the appropriate criteria, it would then be classified as a CAFO and subject to appropriate regulation. That same year, EPA defined livestock and poultry CAFO facilities and established a specialized permitting program. NPDES permit procedures for CAFOs were also promulgated in 1976.Prior to 1976, size had been the main defining criteria of CAFOs. However, after the 1976 regulations came into effect, the EPA stipulated some exceptions. Operations that were identified as particularly harmful to federal waterways could be classified as CAFOs, even if the facilities\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' sizes fall under AFOs standards. Additionally, some CAFOs were not required to apply for wastewater discharge permits if they met the two major operational-based exemptions. The first exception applied to operations that discharge wastewater only during a 25-year, 24-hour storm event. (The operation only discharges during a 24-hour rainfall period that occurs once every 25 years or more on average.) The second exception was when operations apply animal waste onto agricultural land. ==== Developments in the 1990s ==== In 1989, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Public Citizen filed a lawsuit against the EPA (and Administrator of the EPA, William Reilly). The plaintiffs claimed the EPA had not complied with the CWA with respect to CAFOs. The lawsuit, Natural Resources Defense Council v. Reilly (D.D.C. 1991), resulted in a court order mandating the EPA update its regulations. They did so in what would become the 2003 Final Rule.In 1995, the EPA released a \"Guide Manual on NPDES Regulations for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations\" to provide more clarity to the public on NPDES regulation after the EPA\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s report \"Feedlots Case Studies of Selected States\" revealed there was uncertainty in the public regarding CAFO regulatory terminology and criteria. Although the document is not a rule, it did offer insight and furthered public understanding of previous rules. In his 1998 Clean Water Action Plan, President Bill Clinton directed the USDA and the EPA to join forces to develop a framework for future actions to improve national water quality standards for public health. The two federal agencies\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' specific responsibility was to improve the management of animal waste runoff from agricultural activities. In 1998, the USDA and the EPA hosted eleven public meetings across the country to discuss animal feeding operations (AFOs).On March 9, 1999, the agencies released the framework titled the Unified National Strategy for Animal Feeding Operations. In the framework, the agencies recommended six major activities to be included in operations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plans (CNMPs): feed management manure handling and storage land application of manure land management record keeping activities that utilize manure.The framework also outlined two types of related programs. First, \"voluntary programs\" were designed to assist AFO operators with addressing public health and water quality problems. The framework outlines three types of voluntary programs available: \"locally led conservation,\" \"environmental education,\" and \"financial and technical assistance.\" The framework explained that those that participate in voluntary programs are not required to have a comprehensive nutrient management plan (CNMP). The second type of program outlined by the framework was regulatory, which includes command-and-control regulation with NPDES permitting.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 1672551, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-23T08:55:35Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"==== Background laws ==== The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 was one of the first major efforts of the U.S. federal government to establish a comprehensive program for mitigating pollution in public water ways.

      "As a helpful and respectful assistant, I'm here to provide you with accurate information while ensuring safety and avoiding harmful or illegal content. The primary law regulating air quality in the United States is the U.S. Clean Air Act, which was initially enacted as the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955. Over the years, the act has undergone several amendments to strengthen its provisions and address emerging issues related to air pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key features of the U.S. Clean Air Act include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS): The act requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set NAAQS for six common air pollutants, including ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead. These standards are designed to protect public health and welfare.\n",
      "2. State Implementation Plans (SIPs): Each state is required to develop a SIP that outlines how it will meet the NAAQS for its geographic area. The EPA reviews and approves each SIP to ensure compliance with federal standards.\n",
      "3. Emission Standards: The act sets emission standards for new sources of air pollution, such as power plants and industrial facilities. These standards are designed to limit the amount of pollutants that can be released into the atmosphere.\n",
      "4. Operating Permits: The act requires major sources of air pollution to obtain operating permits, which outline the specific emissions limits and control measures for each facility.\n",
      "5. Enforcement Mechanisms: The EPA and state agencies are responsible for enforcing the Clean Air Act through inspections, fines, and other penalties.\n",
      "6. Research and Development: The act authorizes research and development programs to improve our understanding of air pollution and develop new technologies to reduce emissions.\n",
      "7. Public Participation: The act provides for public participation in the rule-making process and requires states to involve the public in the development of their SIPs.\n",
      "8. Interstate Transport: The act addresses interstate transport of air pollutants, ensuring that one state's emissions do not harm other states or the environment as a whole.\n",
      "9. Emergency Episodes: The act authorizes the EPA to declare emergency episodes when air quality is severely degraded due to extreme weather conditions or other factors. During these episodes, stricter emission limits may be imposed to protect public health and welfare.\n",
      "10. Continuous Improvement: The act encourages continuous improvement in air quality by requiring periodic review and update of NAAQS and emissions standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the U.S. Clean Air Act, there are other federal laws and regulations that address pollution-related issues, such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which regulates hazardous waste disposal, and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), which sets standards for drinking water quality. However, the Clean Air Act remains the primary law regulating air quality in the United States.\n",

Progressively stringent norms have been rolled out since then. All new vehicles manufactured after the implementation of the norms have to be compliant with the regulations. Since October 2010, Bharat Stage (BS) III norms have been enforced across the country. In 13 major cities, Bharat Stage IV emission norms have been in place since April 2010 and it has been enforced for entire country since April 2017. In 2016, the Indian government announced that the country would skip the BS V norms altogether and adopt BS VI norms by 2020. In its recent judgment, the Supreme Court has banned the sale and registration of motor vehicles conforming to the emission standard Bharat Stage IV in the entire country from 1 April 2020.On 15 November 2017, the Petroleum Ministry of India, in consultation with public oil marketing companies, decided to bring forward the date of BS VI grade auto fuels in NCT of Delhi with effect from 1 April 2018 instead of 1 April 2020. In fact, Petroleum Ministry OMCs were asked to examine the possibility of introduction of BS VI auto fuels in the whole of NCR area from 1 April 2019. This huge step was taken due to the heavy problem of air pollution faced by Delhi which became worse around 2019. The decision was met with disarray by the automobile companies as they had planned the development according to roadmap for 2020. The phasing out of 2-stroke engine for two wheelers, the cessation of production of the Maruti 800, and the introduction of electronic controls have been due to the regulations related to vehicular emissions.While the norms help in bringing down pollution levels, it invariably results in increased vehicle cost due to the improved technology and higher fuel prices. However, this increase in private cost is offset by savings in health costs for the public, as there is a lesser amount of disease-causing particulate matter and pollution in the air.

It may look like a minor problem initially but in the long run, it poses a threat to children and the elderly. Transport is a major land use, leaving less land available for other purposes. Cars also contribute to pollution of air and water.  Though a horse produces more waste, cars are cheaper, thus far more numerous in urban areas than horses ever were. Emissions of harmful gases like carbon monoxide, ozone, carbon dioxide, benzene and particulate matter can damage living organisms and the environment.  The emissions from cars cause disabilities, respiratory diseases, and ozone depletion. Noise pollution from cars can also potentially result in hearing disabilities, headaches, and stress to those frequently exposed to it. In countries such as the United States the infrastructure that makes car use possible, such as highways, roads and parking lots is funded by the government and supported through zoning and construction requirements. Fuel taxes in the United States cover about 60% of highway construction and repair costs, but little of the cost to construct or repair local roads. Payments by motor-vehicle users fall short of government expenditures tied to motor-vehicle use by 20–70 cents per gallon of gas. Zoning laws in many areas require that large, free parking lots accompany any new buildings. Municipal parking lots are often free or do not charge a market rate. Hence, the cost of driving a car in the US is subsidized, supported by businesses and the government who cover the cost of roads and parking. This is in addition to other external costs car users do not pay like accidents or pollution. Even in countries with higher gas taxes like Germany motorists do not fully pay for the external costs they create. This government support of the automobile through subsidies for infrastructure, the cost of highway patrol enforcement, recovering stolen cars, and many other factors makes public transport a less economically competitive choice for commuters when considering out-of-pocket expenses. Consumers often make choices based on those costs, and underestimate the indirect costs of car ownership, insurance and maintenance. However, globally and in some US cities, tolls and parking fees partially offset these heavy subsidies for driving. Transportation planning policy advocates often support tolls, increased fuel taxes, congestion pricing and market-rate pricing for municipal parking as a means of balancing car use in urban centers with more efficient modes such as buses and trains. When cities charge market rates for parking, and when bridges and tunnels are tolled, driving becomes less competitive in terms of out-of-pocket costs. When municipal parking is underpriced and roads are not tolled, most of the cost of vehicle usage is paid for by general government revenue, a subsidy for motor vehicle use. The size of this subsidy dwarfs the federal, state, and local subsidies for the maintenance of infrastructure and discounted fares for public transportation.By contrast, although there are environmental and social costs for rail, there is a very small impact.Walking or cycling often have net positive impacts on society as they help reduce health costs and produce virtually no pollution. A study attempted to quantify the costs of cars (i.e. of car-use and related decisions and activity such as production and transport/infrastructure policy) in conventional currency, finding that the total lifetime cost of cars in Germany is between 0.6 and 1.0 million euros with the share of this cost born by society being between 41% (€4674 per year) and 29% (€5273 per year). This suggests that cars consume \"a large share of disposable income\", creating \"complexities in perceptions of transport costs, the economic viability of alternative transport modes, or the justification of taxes\".\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 298818, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-18T07:36:04Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'According to the Handbook on estimation of external costs in the transport sector made by the Delft University and which is the main reference in European Union for assessing the externalities of cars, the main external costs of driving a car are: congestion and scarcity costs, accident costs, air pollution costs, noise costs, climate change costs, costs for nature and landscape, costs for water pollution, costs for soil pollution and costs of energy dependency.Use of cars for transportation creates barriers by reducing the landscape required for walking and cycling.

      "As a helpful and respectful assistant, I would like to point out that the question about \"pollution\" is quite broad and could be interpreted in many different ways. However, based on your additional context as a contamination expert, I can provide information on the main economic costs of air pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Air pollution has significant economic costs, both in terms of private costs and public health costs. The private costs include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Increased healthcare expenses: Exposure to poor air quality can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, which result in increased healthcare expenses for individuals and their families. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the economic cost of air pollution in India was estimated to be around 3% of its GDP in 2010.\n",
      "2. Reduced productivity: Air pollution can also reduce productivity, as people may need to take more sick days or experience decreased cognitive function due to poor air quality. This can lead to lost economic output and reduced business profits.\n",
      "3. Increased costs for environmental cleanup: If pollution is not properly managed, it can lead to significant costs for environmental cleanup and remediation. For example, the cost of cleaning up a contaminated site can be extremely high, ranging from tens of thousands to millions of dollars.\n",
      "4. Decreased property values: Poor air quality can also decrease property values, as people may be less likely to buy or rent homes in areas with poor air quality. This can result in lost revenue for real estate developers and homeowners.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, there are also public health costs associated with air pollution, which include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Respiratory diseases: Air pollution can cause respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. These diseases can lead to significant healthcare expenses and lost productivity.\n",
      "2. Cardiovascular diseases: Exposure to poor air quality can also increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes. This can result in significant healthcare expenses and lost productivity.\n",
      "3. Neurological damage: Air pollution has been linked to neurological damage, including decreased cognitive function and increased risk of dementia. This can lead to long-term healthcare costs and reduced quality of life.\n",
      "4. Premature deaths: Exposure to poor air quality can lead to premature deaths, which can result in significant economic costs for families and society as a whole. According to the WHO, air pollution was estimated to cause 6,20,000 early deaths in India in 2010 alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while there are private costs associated with pollution, the public health costs of air pollution far outweigh these costs. Therefore, it is important for individuals and society as a whole to prioritize reducing air pollution and protecting public health.\n",

This suggests that cars consume \"a large share of disposable income\", creating \"complexities in perceptions of transport costs, the economic viability of alternative transport modes, or the justification of taxes\".\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 298818, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-18T07:36:04Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'According to the Handbook on estimation of external costs in the transport sector made by the Delft University and which is the main reference in European Union for assessing the externalities of cars, the main external costs of driving a car are: congestion and scarcity costs, accident costs, air pollution costs, noise costs, climate change costs, costs for nature and landscape, costs for water pollution, costs for soil pollution and costs of energy dependency.Use of cars for transportation creates barriers by reducing the landscape required for walking and cycling. It may look like a minor problem initially but in the long run, it poses a threat to children and the elderly. Transport is a major land use, leaving less land available for other purposes. Cars also contribute to pollution of air and water.  Though a horse produces more waste, cars are cheaper, thus far more numerous in urban areas than horses ever were. Emissions of harmful gases like carbon monoxide, ozone, carbon dioxide, benzene and particulate matter can damage living organisms and the environment.  \\\\\\', \\\\\\'split_id\\\\\\': 0, \\\\\\'tokens\\\\\\': 231}}\\']']\n",

      "\n",
      "Pollution has been linked to a wide range of adverse health effects, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and even premature death. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to air pollution can cause an estimated 6,20,000 early deaths every year, with the highest burden of disease in low- and middle-income countries like India.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to these health impacts, pollution also has significant economic costs. The health cost of air pollution in India, for example, is estimated to be around 3% of its GDP. This means that the financial burden of pollution can have a profound effect on individuals, families, and communities, as well as on the overall economy.\n",

      "As a helpful and respectful assistant, I appreciate your question about the ethical issues related to pollution. It's important to acknowledge that pollution is a complex issue with far-reaching consequences for human health, the environment, and society as a whole. Here are some of the main ethical issues associated with pollution:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Precautionary Principle: This principle states that if an action or policy has the potential to cause harm, precautions should be taken even if the evidence is not definitive. In the context of pollution, this means that we should err on the side of caution and take steps to prevent or minimize the risks associated with pollution, rather than waiting for conclusive proof of harm before taking action.\n",
      "2. The Polluter Pays Principle: This principle holds that those responsible for causing pollution should be held accountable for the costs of cleaning up the mess and any resulting damages. This includes not only financial costs but also social and environmental costs. In other words, the party responsible for the pollution should bear the burden of the consequences, rather than shifting the costs to others or society as a whole.\n",
      "3. The Right to Know: People have a right to know what is being done in their name, especially when it comes to activities that could potentially harm them or their environment. This includes the right to information about pollution sources, exposure risks, and any potential health effects. Transparency and accountability are essential for ensuring public trust and protecting human rights.\n",
      "4. International Liability: As global citizens, we have a shared responsibility to address transboundary environmental harm. This includes the liability of corporations and governments for pollution that crosses national borders or harms indigenous communities. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provides a framework for addressing international liability related to climate change, but more work needs to be done to ensure accountability and justice for those affected by transboundary pollution.\n",
      "5. Environmental Justice: This principle holds that all individuals, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, or socioeconomic status, have the right to live in a healthy and safe environment. It also recognizes that marginalized communities are often disproportionately affected by pollution and other environmental hazards. As such, it is essential to prioritize environmental justice when addressing issues related to pollution and sustainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the ethical issues related to pollution include the need for precaution, accountability, transparency, international liability, and environmental justice. These principles should guide our efforts to mitigate the impacts of pollution and ensure a healthy and safe environment for all.\n",

Reducing travel in vehicles can curb pollution. After Stockholm reduced vehicle traffic in the central city with a congestion tax, nitrogen dioxide and PM10 pollution declined, as did acute pediatric asthma attacks. Biodigesters can be utilized in poor nations where slash and burn is prevalent, turning a useless commodity into a source of income. The plants can be gathered and sold to a central authority that will break them down in a large modern biodigester, producing much needed energy to use.

      "As a Contamination expert, I can identify several key areas where further research is needed in the field of pollution control:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Developing cost-effective and efficient technologies for wastewater treatment: There is a need for more affordable and sustainable solutions to treat wastewater, particularly in developing countries or small communities. Research should focus on improving existing technologies or exploring new ones that can be easily implemented and operated.\n",
      "2. Improving the effectiveness of market-based instruments: Market-based economic instruments like charges, subsidies, deposit or refund schemes, and pollution credits have shown promise in controlling pollution. However, there is a need for more research on how these instruments can be designed and implemented to achieve better environmental outcomes.\n",
      "3. Understanding the impacts of chemical mixtures: Many pollutants are released into the environment as complex mixtures rather than individual substances. Research should focus on understanding the effects of these mixture on human health and the environment, and developing effective strategies for controlling them.\n",
      "4. Integrating environmental considerations into product design: Products that are designed with environmental considerations in mind can help reduce waste and pollution throughout their lifecycle. Research is needed to develop more sustainable products and production processes.\n",
      "5. Developing better monitoring and enforcement tools: Effective monitoring and enforcement of pollution regulations are critical for successful pollution control strategies. Research should focus on developing new technologies and methods that can improve the accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of monitoring and enforcement activities.\n",
      "6. Addressing transboundary pollution issues: Pollution often crosses national borders, posing challenges for regulatory frameworks and international cooperation. Research is needed to develop more effective strategies for addressing transboundary pollution issues.\n",
      "7. Improving the public's understanding of environmental risks: Public education and awareness are essential components of successful pollution control efforts. Research should focus on developing effective communication strategies that can help the public better understand environmental risks and make more informed decisions about their impact on the environment.\n",
      "8. Developing holistic approaches to chemical pollution control: Chemical pollution is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive approach, considering all aspects of the product lifecycle from production to disposal. Research should focus on developing integrated solutions that consider the entire supply chain and the potential risks associated with each stage.\n",
      "9. Investigating new technologies for waste reduction and recycling: New technologies can help reduce waste and increase recycling rates, which can in turn reduce pollution. Research should focus on exploring innovative approaches to waste reduction and recycling that are cost-effective, efficient, and scalable.\n",
      "10. Evaluating the effectiveness of existing regulations: Existing regulations play a crucial role in controlling pollution, but their effectiveness can vary depending on factors such as enforcement mechanisms and compliance rates. Research should focus on evaluating the impacts of current regulations and identifying areas where improvements could be made.\n",

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\"Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored.

      "Reducing pollution is a complex challenge that involves various factors and stakeholders. Some of the main challenges to reducing pollution include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Lack of awareness and education: Many people are not aware of the harmful effects of pollution, or they may not understand how their daily activities contribute to it. Education and awareness campaigns can help address this issue.\n",
      "2. Economic considerations: Some industries and activities generate significant amounts of pollution as a byproduct of their operations. Reducing pollution from these sources can be costly, and companies may resist implementing stricter regulations or investing in cleaner technologies if they perceive them as threatening their profitability.\n",
      "3. Political and regulatory challenges: Implementing effective policies and regulations to reduce pollution requires political will and cooperation among different levels of government. In some cases, politically powerful industries may resist stricter regulations or lobby for weaker standards.\n",
      "4. Technological limitations: While there are many technologies available to reduce pollution, their effectiveness can be limited by factors such as cost, availability, and feasibility of implementation. For example, transitioning to cleaner energy sources like solar or wind power may not be practical in all regions due to geographical constraints or lack of infrastructure.\n",
      "5. Social inequality: Communities of color, low-income communities, and other marginalized groups are disproportionately affected by pollution. Addressing these disparities requires a comprehensive approach that includes policy changes, community engagement, and social equity considerations.\n",
      "6. International cooperation: Air pollution is a global problem that requires international coordination and cooperation to address effectively. Different countries have different priorities, economic systems, and political structures, which can make it challenging to achieve consensus on how to reduce pollution.\n",
      "7. Lack of data and monitoring: In many parts of the world, there is a lack of reliable data and monitoring mechanisms to track pollution levels and assess the effectiveness of reduction efforts. This makes it difficult to identify areas where interventions are needed most urgently.\n",
      "8. Complexity of the issue: Air pollution is a complex problem that involves many different sources, including transportation, industry, energy production, and agriculture. Addressing this complexity requires a comprehensive approach that considers all these factors and their interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, reducing pollution is a challenging task that requires a multifaceted approach, careful consideration of economic and political factors, and international cooperation to address the issue effectively.\n",

      "As a Contamination expert, I can provide insights on the future of pollution control based on current trends and technological advancements. The shift towards sustainable transportation, renewable energy sources, and cleaner fuels are critical components of reducing air pollution. Here are some potential developments in the field:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Electric Vehicles (EVs): EVs will continue to gain popularity as battery technology improves, making them more affordable and accessible. Governments worldwide are setting targets for EV adoption, which will drive demand and investment in charging infrastructure. This transition from fossil-fuel-powered vehicles will significantly reduce emissions and improve air quality.\n",
      "2. Alternative Fuels: The use of alternative fuels like hydrogen fuel cells, biofuels, and compressed natural gas (CNG) will become more widespread, particularly in heavy-duty transportation such as trucks and buses. These alternatives can reduce emissions by up to 90% compared to traditional fossil fuels.\n",
      "3. Autonomous Vehicles: The development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) will lead to more efficient use of public transport, reducing the need for personal vehicle ownership and decreasing overall emissions. AVs can also optimize routes to reduce fuel consumption and minimize idling time.\n",
      "4. Public Transportation: Investment in public transport infrastructure, such as light rail systems and bus rapid transit (BRT), will continue to grow, providing more people with access to cleaner forms of transportation. This shift towards public transport can help reduce the number of privately owned vehicles on the road, leading to a decrease in emissions.\n",
      "5. Bicycle Infrastructure: Cities are investing in bicycle infrastructure, such as bike lanes and bike-sharing systems, making cycling a more attractive option for short trips. This can help reduce emissions from transportation and improve air quality.\n",
      "6. Remote Work: With the rise of remote work, there may be less need for daily commutes, leading to reduced emissions from transportation. Employers are adopting flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or compressed workweeks, which can help reduce the number of vehicles on the road.\n",
      "7. Renewable Energy: The transition towards renewable energy sources like solar and wind power will continue to gain momentum. This shift away from fossil fuels for electricity generation will significantly reduce emissions and improve air quality.\n",
      "8. Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS): CCUS technologies can capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial processes, then utilize or store them to prevent release into the atmosphere. This technology has the potential to significantly reduce emissions from heavy industries like cement production and steel manufacturing.\n",
      "9. Air Purification Technologies: As air pollution remains a significant concern in many cities, there will be an increased focus on developing and implementing air purification technologies such as smog-eating buildings, urban green spaces, and air filtration systems for homes and vehicles.\n",
      "10. International Cooperation: Global cooperation to address transboundary air pollution will become more critical as the impacts of climate change and poor air quality are felt across borders. This may involve international agreements, joint research initiatives, and sharing of best practices to reduce emissions and improve air quality globally.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the future of pollution control involves a multi-faceted approach that includes the adoption of cleaner technologies, sustainable transportation options, renewable energy sources, and international cooperation. By prioritizing these developments, we can work towards reducing emissions and improving air quality for a healthier and more sustainable future.\n",

There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer.

Volcanic emissions vary significantly in composition, and have complex chemistry due to the presence of ash particulates and a wide variety of other elements in the plume. Only stratovolcanoes containing primarily felsic magmas are responsible for these fluxes, as mafic magma erupted in shield volcanoes doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t result in plumes which reach the stratosphere. However, before the Industrial Revolution, dimethyl sulfide pathway was the largest contributor to sulfate aerosol concentrations in a more average year with no major volcanic activity. According to the IPCC First Assessment Report, published in 1990, volcanic emissions usually amounted to around 10 million tons in 1980s, while dimethyl sulfide amounted to 40 million tons. Yet, by that point, the global human-caused emissions of sulfur into the atmosphere became \"at least as large\" as all natural emissions of sulfur-containing compounds combined: they were at less than 3 million tons per year in 1860, and then they increased to 15 million tons in 1900, 40 million tons in 1940 and about 80 millions in 1980. The same report noted that \"in the industrialized regions of Europe and North America, anthropogenic emissions dominate over natural emissions by about a factor of ten or even more\". In the eastern United States, sulfate particles were estimated to account for 25% or more of all air pollution. Meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere had much lower concentrations due to being much less densely populated, with an estimated 90% of the human population in the north. In the early 1990s, anthropogenic sulfur dominated in the Northern Hemisphere, where only 16% of annual sulfur emissions were natural, yet amounted for less than half of the emissions in the Southern Hemisphere. Such an increase in sulfate aerosol emissions had a variety of effects. At the time, the most visible one was acid rain, caused by precipitation from clouds carrying high concentrations of sulfate aerosols in the troposphere. At its peak, acid rain has eliminated brook trout and some other fish species and insect life from lakes and streams in geographically sensitive areas, such as Adirondack Mountains in the United States. Acid rain worsens soil function as some of its microbiota is lost and heavy metals like aluminium are mobilized (spread more easily)  while essential nutrients and minerals such as magnesium can leach away because of the same. Ultimately, plants unable to tolerate lowered pH are killed, with montane forests being some of the worst-affected ecosystems due to their regular exposure to sulfate-carrying fog at high altitudes. While acid rain was too dilute to affect human health directly, breathing smog or even any air with elevated sulfate concentrations is known to contribute to heart and lung conditions, including asthma and bronchitis. Further, this form of pollution is linked to preterm birth and low birth weight, with a study of 74,671 pregnant women in Beijing finding that every additional 100 µg/m3 of SO2 in the air reduced infants\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' weight by 7.3 g, making it and other forms of air pollution the largest attributable risk factor for low birth weight ever observed. ==== Control measures ==== Due largely to the US EPA\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Acid Rain Program, the U.S. has had a 33% decrease in emissions between 1983 and 2002 (see table). This improvement resulted in part from flue-gas desulfurization, a technology that enables SO2 to be chemically bound in power plants burning sulfur-containing coal or petroleum. In particular, calcium oxide (lime) reacts with sulfur dioxide to form calcium sulfite: CaO + SO2 →  CaSO3Aerobic oxidation of the CaSO3 gives CaSO4, anhydrite.  Most gypsum sold in Europe comes from flue-gas desulfurization. To control sulfur emissions, dozens of methods with relatively high efficiencies have been developed for fitting of coal-fired power plants. Sulfur can be removed from coal during burning by using limestone as a bed material in fluidized bed combustion.Sulfur can also be removed from fuels before burning, preventing formation of SO2 when the fuel is burnt. The Claus process is used in refineries to produce sulfur as a byproduct.  The Stretford process has also been used to remove sulfur from fuel. Redox processes using iron oxides can also be used, for example, Lo-Cat or Sulferox.Fuel additives such as calcium additives and magnesium carboxylate may be used in marine engines to lower the emission of sulfur dioxide gases into the atmosphere.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 50958, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-20T08:42:33Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"At its peak, acid rain has eliminated brook trout and some other fish species and insect life from lakes and streams in geographically sensitive areas, such as Adirondack Mountains in the United States.

      "Hello! As a helpful and respectful assistant, I'm here to provide you with accurate and socially unbiased information. Acid rain, which is caused by air pollution, can have devastating effects on aquatic ecosystems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, acid rain can alter the pH level of water bodies, making them more acidic. This can lead to a decline in the population of insect and aquatic life-forms that are sensitive to changes in water pH. For example, fish and other aquatic organisms may struggle to survive in highly acidic waters, as their gills and other body parts may become damaged or unable to function properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, acid rain can also damage the habitats of these life-forms. For instance, it can leach nutrients from the soil and alter the chemical composition of the water, which can disrupt the food chain and ecosystem balance. Additionally, acid rain can cause the release of toxic metals such as aluminum and mercury into the water, further harming aquatic life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, acid rain can also affect human health. Exposure to highly acidic waters can cause skin irritation, respiratory problems, and other health issues. Children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to these effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that the impact of acid rain on aquatic ecosystems is not limited to direct damage to life-forms and habitats. It can also have long-term consequences for the overall health and biodiversity of these ecosystems, as well as for human communities that rely on them for drinking water, food, and recreation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, acid rain has significant adverse impacts on aquatic ecosystems, including altered pH levels, habitat damage, toxic metal release, and negative effects on human health. As a contamination expert, I strongly advise taking measures to reduce air pollution and prevent acid rain from occurring in the first place. This can include implementing emissions controls, increasing energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable transportation options. By working together to address this issue, we can help protect our planet's precious aquatic ecosystems for future generations.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Surface runoff: When rain or irrigation waters wash over farm fields, pastures, and feedlots, they can carry pesticides and other chemicals into nearby waterways, leading to contamination.\n",
      "2. Leaching: Pesticides can leach through the soil and reach groundwater, which can then seep into surface water sources, such as rivers and lakes.\n",
      "3. Runoff from fish-farming operations: Fish farming, like other forms of agriculture, can also contribute to pesticide pollution through runoff and waste discharge.\n",
      "4. Inadequate storage and handling: Improper storage and handling of pesticides on farm fields can lead to spills and leaks, which can contaminate soil, groundwater, and surface water sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that not all agricultural runoff contains high levels of pesticides, but it is a common occurrence in many areas. To mitigate the risks associated with pesticide pollution from agricultural runoff, farmers can implement best management practices (BMPs) such as using integrated pest management techniques, reducing the use of pesticides, and properly storing and handling chemicals. Additionally, regulatory agencies can set standards for pesticide use and monitoring to ensure that waterways remain safe for human consumption and aquatic life.\n",

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Nitrogen oxides (NOx): These compounds are produced during high-temperature combustion processes, such as those used in power plants, cement factories, and other industrial facilities. NOx can react with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to form ground-level ozone and acid rain.\n",

It is not emitted directly by car engines or by industrial operations, but formed by the reaction of sunlight on air containing hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides that react to form ozone directly at the source of the pollution or many kilometers downwind. Ozone reacts directly with some hydrocarbons such as aldehydes and thus begins their removal from the air, but the products are themselves key components of smog. Ozone photolysis by UV light leads to production of the hydroxyl radical HO• and this plays a part in the removal of hydrocarbons from the air, but is also the first step in the creation of components of smog such as peroxyacyl nitrates, which can be powerful eye irritants. The atmospheric lifetime of tropospheric ozone is about 22 days; its main removal mechanisms are being deposited to the ground, the above-mentioned reaction giving HO•, and by reactions with OH and the peroxy radical HO2•.There is evidence of significant reduction in agricultural yields because of increased ground-level ozone and pollution which interferes with photosynthesis and stunts overall growth of some plant species. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a secondary regulation to reduce crop damage, in addition to the primary regulation designed for the protection of human health. ==== Low level ozone in urban areas ==== Certain examples of cities with elevated ozone readings are Denver, Colorado; Houston, Texas; and Mexico City, Mexico. Houston has a reading of around 41 nmol/mol, while Mexico City is far more hazardous, with a reading of about 125 nmol/mol.Low level ozone, or tropospheric ozone, is the most concerning type of ozone pollution in urban areas and is increasing in general. Ozone pollution in urban areas affects denser populations, and is worsened by high populations of vehicles, which emit pollutants NO2 and VOCs, the main contributors to problematic ozone levels. Ozone pollution in urban areas is especially concerning with increasing temperatures, raising heat-related mortality during heat waves. During heat waves in urban areas, ground level ozone pollution can be 20% higher than usual. Ozone pollution in urban areas reaches higher levels of exceedance in the summer and autumn, which may be explained by weather patterns and traffic patterns. People experiencing poverty are more affected by pollution in general, even though these populations are less likely to be contributing to pollution levels.As mentioned above, Denver, Colorado, is one of the many cities in the U.S. that have high amounts of ozone. According to the American Lung Association, the Denver–Aurora area is the 14th most ozone-polluted area in the U.S. The problem of high ozone levels is not new to this area. In 2004, the EPA allotted the Denver Metro/North Front Range as non-attainment areas per 1997\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s 8-hour ozone standard, but later deferred this status until 2007. The non-attainment standard indicates that an area does not meet the EPA\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s air quality standards. The Colorado Ozone Action Plan was created in response, and numerous changes were implemented from this plan. The first major change was that car emission testing was expanded across the state to more counties that did not previously mandate emissions testing, like areas of Larimer and Weld County. There have also been changes made to decrease Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions, which should help lower ozone levels. One large contributor to high ozone levels in the area is the oil and natural gas industry situated in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJB) which overlaps with a majority of Colorado\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s metropolitan areas. Ozone is created naturally in the Earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s stratosphere, but is also created in the troposphere from human efforts. Briefly mentioned above, NOx and VOCs react with sunlight to create ozone through a process called photochemistry. One hour elevated ozone events (<75 ppb) \"occur during June–August indicating that elevated ozone levels are driven by regional photochemistry\". According to an article from the University of Colorado-Boulder, \"Oil and natural gas VOC emission have a major role in ozone production and bear the potential to contribute to elevated O3 levels in the Northern Colorado Front Range (NCFR)\". Using complex analyses to research wind patterns and emissions from large oil and natural gas operations, the authors concluded that \"elevated O3 levels in the NCFR are predominantly correlated with air transport from N– ESE, which are the upwind sectors where the O&NG operations in the Wattenberg Field area of the DJB are located\".Contained in the Colorado Ozone Action Plan, created in 2008, plans exist to evaluate \"emission controls for large industrial sources of NOx\" and \"statewide control requirements for new oil and gas condensate tanks and pneumatic valves\". In 2011, the Regional Haze Plan was released that included a more specific plan to help decrease NOx emissions. These efforts are increasingly difficult to implement and take many years to come to pass. Of course there are also other reasons that ozone levels remain high. These include: a growing population meaning more car emissions, and the mountains along the NCFR that can trap emissions. If interested, daily air quality readings can be found at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s website. As noted earlier, Denver continues to experience high levels of ozone to this day. It will take many years and a systems-thinking approach to combat this issue of high ozone levels in the Front Range of Colorado. ==== Ozone cracking ==== Ozone gas attacks any polymer possessing olefinic or double bonds within its chain structure, such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber, and styrene-butadiene rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, the rate of crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. Ozone cracking used to be a serious problem in car tires, for example, but it is not an issue with modern tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like gaskets and O-rings, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. Fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking. The commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 22718, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-25T16:03:55Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'Low level ozone (or tropospheric ozone) is an atmospheric pollutant.

      "The ozone layer is a region of the stratosphere that contains a high concentration of ozone (O3), a gas that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. The ozone layer acts as a shield, absorbing most of the Sun's UV radiation before it reaches the surface of the planet. This helps to prevent damage to living organisms and the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, human activities such as the use of certain chemicals and pollutants can deplete the ozone layer, allowing more UV radiation to reach the Earth's surface. This can have negative effects on both human health and the environment. For example, exposure to high levels of UV radiation can cause sunburn, skin cancer, and damage to crops and marine life.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, ground-level ozone (GLO) is formed when nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other pollutants react in the presence of sunlight. GLO can irritate the respiratory system, causing coughing, choking, and reduced lung capacity. It also has many negative effects throughout the ecosystem, including damage to crops, forests, and aquatic life.\n",

Oils and hydraulic oils are also common contaminants.Wastewater from metal mines and ore recovery plants are inevitably contaminated by the minerals present in the native rock formations. Following crushing and extraction of the desirable materials, undesirable materials may enter the wastewater stream. For metal mines, this can include unwanted metals such as zinc and other materials such as arsenic. Extraction of high value metals such as gold and silver may generate slimes containing very fine particles in where physical removal of contaminants becomes particularly difficult.Additionally, the geologic formations that harbour economically valuable metals such as copper and gold very often consist of sulphide-type ores. The processing entails grinding the rock into fine particles and then extracting the desired metal(s), with the leftover rock being known as tailings. These tailings contain a combination of not only undesirable leftover metals, but also sulphide components which eventually form sulphuric acid upon the exposure to air and water that inevitably occurs when the tailings are disposed of in large impoundments. The resulting acid mine drainage, which is often rich in heavy metals (because acids dissolve metals), is one of the many environmental impacts of mining.\\', \\'split_id\\': 0, \\'tokens\\': 403}}\"]']\n",

      "Mining can contribute to both air and water contamination through various activities and processes involved in the extraction of valuable minerals. Here are some ways in which mining can impact the environment:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Air Pollution:\n",
      "a) Diesel Emissions: Heavy machinery used in mining operations, such as haul trucks and generators, emit diesel fumes that contribute to air pollution. These emissions contain harmful gases like nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n",
      "b) Dust Particles: Mining activities can stir up large amounts of dust, which can lead to respiratory problems for miners and nearby communities. The dust may also contain heavy metals like lead, mercury, and arsenic, which can be harmful if inhaled.\n",
      "c) Mine Fires: Coal mines are particularly prone to fires, which can release large amounts of carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and other pollutants into the air. These emissions can contribute to climate change and respiratory problems for nearby communities.\n",
      "2. Water Pollution:\n",
      "a) Acid Mine Drainage (AMD): The oxidation of sulfide minerals in tailings impoundments produces acid mine drainage, which is rich in heavy metals like copper, lead, and mercury. AMD can contaminate nearby water sources, posing a risk to both human health and the environment.\n",
      "b) Tailings Leachates: The leaching of metals from tailings can also contribute to water pollution. For example, gold mines may release cyanide-containing solutions into the environment if their storage facilities are not properly maintained.\n",
      "c) Wastewater Contamination: Mining operations often generate large volumes of wastewater, which may contain a variety of contaminants like oils, hydraulic fluids, and chemicals used in processing. If these wastes are not properly treated before being discharged into waterways, they can harm aquatic ecosystems and human health.\n",
      "3. Other Environmental Impacts: Mining activities can also affect the environment through habitat destruction, soil erosion, and changes to local hydrology. For example, open-pit mining can create large craters that may become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other pests, while underground mining can cause subsidence (sinking) of the ground surface, leading to structural damage and water pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, mining activities can contribute to both air and water contamination through various mechanisms, including emissions from heavy machinery, dust particles, mine fires, acid mine drainage, tailings leachates, wastewater contamination, habitat destruction, soil erosion, and changes to local hydrology. It is important for mining companies to implement best management practices (BMPs) and environmental regulations to minimize these impacts and protect the environment and human health.\n",

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\"Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored.

      "One of the most significant initiatives addressing air pollution on a global scale is the Paris Agreement, adopted by almost all countries in 2015. The agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it even further to 1.5°C. To achieve this goal, countries have agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to air pollution, through nationally determined contributions (NDCs).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Paris Agreement also encourages the development and transfer of clean technologies and the promotion of sustainable land use practices to help mitigate climate change. Additionally, it provides a framework for countries to cooperate on addressing air pollution and other environmental challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another significant initiative is the Clean Air Initiative (CAI), launched by the World Bank in 2018. The CAI aims to reduce air pollution in cities across developing countries, particularly in Asia and Africa. The initiative provides technical assistance, funding, and policy support to help governments implement clean air policies and improve air quality monitoring.\n",

Although there are many effects of noise pollution, two specific consequences are adjustments in population distribution and modified animal communication. Birds provide a clear example of both of these consequences. Altered population distributions can affect inter-species interactions. For example, the diversity of birds in the woodlands of New Mexico was significantly reduced in areas with unnatural noise levels. This change in diversity resulted in less nest predation, which was explained by the decreased presence of the dominant predator - the scrub-jay. This effect has also been observed in owls. A negative correlation was found between the noise intensity of an area and the probability that a long-eared owl will reside in that region. Suggested explanations for this outcome are that hunting efficiency was diminished and communication was less effective. Noise pollution also affects conspecific communication. High noise levels may require animals to adjust their vocalizations in order for communication to remain effective. Bird songs are a well-studied component of animal communication. The use of adjusted songs was observed in Savannah sparrows residing in noisy environments. Adjusted songs were so distinct that their use in the control environment did not result in responses (i.e. aggressive territorial behaviour) typically observed when non-adjusted songs were vocalized. Failure to recognize conspecific vocalizations can also be detrimental to male-male competition. Male urban white-crowned sparrows approached stimulus songs of intruders more closely, regardless of song type, when in the presence of noise pollution. A higher frequency of harmful fights is a suggested consequence of this behaviour because of the relatively small distance between the intruding and defending males. ==== Marine animals ==== Noise pollution can also affect marine animals. There are many sources of noise in the world\\\\\\'s oceans, such as the sounds produced by commercial shipping, sonars and acoustic deterrents. Unnatural noise levels can negatively affect reproductive behaviour, such as courtship behaviours. For example, painted goby males did not take part in visual courtship behaviour when in a noisy environment. Female painted gobies in this experiment were also less likely to spawn in a noisy environment. Noise pollution can also affect foraging behaviour in marine animals, which results in less effective strategies. Porpoises have been found to make fewer prey capture attempts, dive deeper, and cut their foraging behaviour short when a vessel passes by, which results in a higher energy expenditure.  Shore crabs were also observed interrupting their foraging behaviour when in the presence of ship noise. Antipredator behaviour in marine animals has also been known to change when noise levels are high. Shore crabs took longer to return to their shelters when in the presence of ship noise. Neolamprologus pulcher (a cichlid fish) females defended their nest less against predators when boat noise was present. ==== Recommendations for marine animals ==== Specific mitigation strategies and recommendations have been presented by the Marine Mammal Commission (2007). They offer multiple ways to alleviate noise pollution in the ocean. Some strategies include removing the source of noise, employing sound attenuation devices, limiting the use of the sound source and monitoring operational requirements. They recommend improving research programs, creating consistent regulation standards that are better enforced and improving mitigation strategies.\", \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 56304602, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-05-14T09:29:23Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'==== Birds ==== Noise pollution is widespread, which is mostly a result of transportation networks.

There are a variety of natural underwater sounds produced by waves in coastal and shelf habitats, and biotic communication signals that do not negatively impact the ecosystem. The changes in behavior of invertebrates vary depending on the type of anthropogenic noise and is similar to natural noisescapes.Experiments have examined the behavior and physiology of the clam (Ruditapes philippinarum), the decapod (Nephrops norvegicus), and the brittlestar (Amphiura filiformis) that are affected by sounds resembling shipping and building noises. The three invertebrates in the experiment were exposed to continuous broadband noise and impulsive broadband noise. The anthropogenic noise impeded the bioirrigation and burying behavior of Nephrops norvegicus. In addition, the decapod exhibited a reduction in movement. Ruditapes philippinarum experienced stress which caused a reduction in surface relocation. The anthropogenic noise caused the clams to close their valves and relocate to an area above the interface of the sediment-water. This response inhibits the clam from mixing the top layer of the sediment profile and hinders suspension feeding. Sound causes Amphiura filiformis to experience changes in physiological processes which results in irregularity of bioturbation behavior.These invertebrates play an important role in transporting substances for benthic nutrient cycling. As a result, ecosystems are negatively impacted when species cannot perform natural behaviors in their environment. Locations with shipping lanes, dredging, or commercial harbors are known as continuous broadband sound. Pile-driving, and construction are sources that exhibit impulsive broadband noise. The different types of broadband noise have different effects on the varying species of invertebrates and how they behave in their environment.Another study found that the valve closures in the Pacific oyster Magallana gigas was a behavioral response to varying degrees of acoustic amplitude levels and noise frequencies. Oysters perceive near-field sound vibrations by utilizing statocysts. In addition, they have superficial receptors that detect variations in water pressure. Sound pressure waves from shipping can be produced below 200Hz. Pile driving generates noise between 20 and 1000 Hz. In addition, large explosions can create frequencies ranging from 10 to 200Hz. M. gigas can detect these noise sources because their sensory system can detect sound in the 10 to < 1000Hz range.The anthropogenic noise produced by human activity has been shown to negatively impact oysters. Studies have revealed that wide and relaxed valves are indicative of healthy oysters. The oysters are stressed when they do not open their valves as frequently in response to environmental noise. This provides support that the oysters detect noise at low acoustic energy levels. While we generally understand that marine noise pollution influences charismatic megafauna like whales and dolphins, understanding  how invertebrates like oysters perceive and respond to human generated sound can provide further insight about the effects of anthropogenic noise on the larger ecosystem. The aquatic ecosystems are known to use sound to navigate, find food, and protect themselves. In 2020, one of the worst mass stranding of whales occurred in Australia. Experts suggest that noise pollution plays a major role in the mass stranding of whales.Noise pollution has also altered avian communities and diversity. Anthropogenic noises have a similar effect on bird population as seen in marine ecosystems, where noises reduce reproductive success; cannot detect predators due to interferences of anthropogenic noises, minimize nesting areas, increase stress response, and species abundances and richness declining. Certain avian species are more sensitive to noises compared to others, resulting in highly-sensitive birds migrating to less disturbed habitats. There has also been evidence of indirect positive effects of anthropogenic noises on avian populations. It was found that nesting bird predators, such as the western scrub-jay (Aphelocoma californica), were uncommon in noisy environments (western scrub-jay are sensitive to noise). Therefore, reproductive success for nesting prey communities was higher due to the lack of predators. Noise pollution can alter the distribution and abundance of prey species, which can then impact predator populations.\\', \\'WikipageID\\': 66599, \\'LastModified\\': \\'2023-12-27T06:40:19Z\\', \\'split\\': \\'The aquatic ecosystems are known to use sound to navigate, find food, and protect themselves.

      "Noise pollution from human activities such as transportation networks, construction, and industrial operations can have a significant impact on wildlife behavior and ecosystems.

This change in diversity was linked to less nest predation, which was attributed to the decreased presence of the dominant predator - the scrub-jay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noise pollution can also affect animal communication and behavior by altering their vocalizations and auditory cues. For example, noise from human activities can drown out the calls of birds and other animals, making it difficult for them to communicate with each other over long distances or even within the same location. This can lead to changes in mating behaviors, territorial boundaries, and hunting strategies, among others.\n",

      "Furthermore, noise pollution can have a broader impact on ecosystems by altering the composition of plant communities, changing water quality, and affecting soil health.

Two scenarios are possible. A broad reading would be interpreted as knocking out all section 404 jurisdiction and Corps regulation of isolated waters and wetlands. However, a narrow reading, one asserting that jurisdiction will be found lacking only if the sole connection to interstate commerce is the presence of migratory birds and wildlife, would allow federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue (such as in waters that are used by interstate travelers for recreation). The question of which view the government would take was answered in a January 19 memorandum issued jointly by EPA and the Corps for headquarters and field/regional staff who work on the section 404 program, discussed above; the agencies provide a legal interpretation, based on a narrow reading of the Court\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s decision. A key policy question that may not be clearly answered for some time is how regulatory protection of wetlands will be affected or reduced as a result of the decision. Many types of isolated wetlands are not physically adjacent to navigable waters and under a broad reading of the decision, would lack regulation. Major wetland types that potentially would not be regulated include prairie potholes of the Upper Midwest, wet meadows, river fringing wetlands along small non-navigable rivers and streams, lake fringing wetlands for smaller non-navigable lakes, many forested wetlands, playas and vernal ponds of Texas and other areas of the west, seeps and spring, flats, bogs and large amounts of tundra in Alaska. A new report by the Department of Interior\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that in 1997, there were 105,500,000 acres (427,000 km2) of wetlands on public and private lands in the conterminous United States and that between 1986 and 1997, a net of 644,000 acres (2,610 km2) of wetlands was lost. According to an analysis prepared by the Association of State Wetland Managers (ASWM), accurate estimates of impacts of the decision on wetland resources are not possible, in part because of uncertainty about how key terms in the opinion (such as \"adjacent\" and \"tributary\") will be defined, whether broadly or narrowly. Still, ASWM believes that impacts are likely to be environmentally significant. Tentative state estimates which have been provided to the Association of State Wetland Managers suggest 30% to 79% of total wetland acreage may be   affected.... Even if SWANCC results in only a one percent loss of America\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s wetlands, the decision would cause more wetlands to be destroyed than were lost in the past decade.Scientists recognize the value of wetlands on the basis of a range of physical functions that they perform. One group of functions relates to water quality. Wetlands are good water filters: they remove and retain nutrients, they process chemical and organic wastes, and they reduce sediment loads to receiving waters. Wetlands also provide flood damage protection to urban and agricultural lands by storing flood waters that overflow river banks or surface waters and by collecting waters in isolated depressions. Wetlands recharge groundwater reserves that are hydrological: connected to surface waters. According to a 1995 National Research Council report, many of these functions occur irrespective of whether the wetlands are isolated or contiguous to navigable waters because of groundwater connections between isolate) wetlands and surface waters. Small, shallow wetlands that are isolated from rivers are frequently important to waterfowl, the NRC said, for food and forage. Also, sites that are intermittently flooded, even those that may be completely dry for several years, can be important for storing flood waters and can have distinctive water-dependent biota (plants and animals) that persist over dry intervals but return when water return to the site.The SWANCC decision affects not only privately owned lands but also isolated waters and wetlands on public lands: the federal government owns about one- third of the nation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s lands. As a result of the Court\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s decision, federal agency decisions on these lands affecting isolated wetlands will no longer be subject to section 404 permitting, but they will still be subject to requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and Executive Orders dealing with wetlands, floodplain management, and protection of migratory birds. In addition to the section 404 program, questions arise about impacts of the SWANCC ruling on other parts of the CWA, especially its principal permit program, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program under section 402. It requires permits for pollutant discharges from point sources (industrial facilities and municipal sewage plants) into the nation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s waters. Another provision, section 311, concerns liability for oil discharges into the nation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s waters. Neither was at issue in this case but might be challenged through extension of the ruling. The January 19 joint Corps-EPA memorandum states that federal implementation of any other CWA provision that involves \"waters of the United States\" will be governed by the same interpretation that applies to section 404. As a result, federal jurisdiction to require NPDES permits or assess oil spill liability in some isolated waters could be limited. Such impacts will become clearer in time.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 23451176, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-09-13T03:05:59Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"Even if SWANCC results in only a one percent loss of America\\\\\\'s wetlands, the decision would cause more wetlands to be destroyed than were lost in the past decade.Scientists recognize the value of wetlands on the basis of a range of physical functions that they perform.

Studies have shown that restored wetlands can become productive CO2 sinks and many restoration projects have been enacted in the US and around the world. Aside from climate benefits, wetland restoration and conservation can help preserve biodiversity, improve water quality, and aid with flood control.The plants that make up wetlands absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and convert it into organic matter. The waterlogged nature of the soil slows down the decomposition of organic material, leading to the accumulation of carbon-rich peat, acting as a long-term carbon sink. Additionally, anaerobic conditions in waterlogged soils hinder the complete breakdown of organic matter, promoting the conversion of carbon into more stable forms.As with forests, for the sequestration process to succeed, the wetland must remain undisturbed. If it is disturbed somehow, the carbon stored in the plants and sediments will be released back into the atmosphere and the ecosystem will no longer function as a carbon sink. Additionally, some wetlands can release non-CO2 greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide which could offset potential climate benefits. The amounts of carbon sequestered via blue carbon by wetlands can also be difficult to measure.Wetlands are created when water overflows into heavily vegetated soil causing plants to adapt to a flooded ecosystem. Wetlands can occur in three different regions. Marine wetlands are found in shallow coastal areas, tidal wetlands are also coastal but are found farther inland, and non-tidal wetlands are found inland and have no effects from tides. Wetland soil is an important carbon sink; 14.5% of the world\\\\\\'s soil carbon is found in wetlands, while only 5.5% of the world\\\\\\'s land is composed of wetlands. Not only are wetlands a great carbon sink, they have many other benefits like collecting floodwater, filtering air and water pollutants, and creating a home for numerous birds, fish, insects, and plants.Climate change could alter soil carbon storage changing it from a sink to a source. With rising temperatures comes an increase in greenhouse gasses from wetlands especially locations with permafrost. When this permafrost melts it increases the available oxygen and water in the soil. Because of this, bacteria in the soil would create large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane to be released into the atmosphere.The link between climate change and wetlands is still not fully known. It is also not clear how restored wetlands manage carbon while still being a contributing source of methane. However, preserving these areas would help prevent further release of carbon into the atmosphere. ==== Peatlands, mires and peat bogs ==== Peatlands hold approximately 30% of the carbon in our ecosystem. When they are drained for agricultural land and urbanization, because peatlands are so vast, large quantities of carbon decompose and emit CO2 into the atmosphere. The loss of one peatland could potentially produce more carbon than 175–500 years of methane emissions.Peat bogs act as a sink for carbon because they accumulate partially decayed biomass that would otherwise continue to decay completely. There is a variance on how much the peatlands act as a carbon sink or carbon source that can be linked to varying climates in different areas of the world and different times of the year.  By creating new bogs, or enhancing existing ones, the amount of carbon that is sequestered by bogs would increase.\", \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 4535852, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-20T15:54:40Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"Wetland restoration involves restoring a wetland\\\\\\'s natural biological, geological, and chemical functions through re-establishment or rehabilitation.

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.

      "One natural process that can help mitigate water contamination in rivers and lakes is sedimentation. Sedimentation occurs when suspended particles, such as clay, silt, and other organic matter, settle to the bottom of a body of water over time. This process helps to remove pollutants and contaminants from the water column, improving water quality and reducing the risk of harm to aquatic life. Additionally, sedimentation can help to improve the clarity and transparency of the water, allowing for better growth and development of aquatic plants and animals. Other natural processes that can help mitigate water contamination include biodegradation, which is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, and filtration through soil and other geological formations.\n",

Water warming has also been seen to persist in systems for long periods of time, even after plants have been removed.When warm water from power plant coolant enters systems, it often mixes leading to general increases in water temperature throughout the water body, including deep cooler water. Specifically in lakes and similar water bodies, stratification leads to different effects on a seasonal basis. In the summer, thermal pollution has been seen to increase deeper water temperature more dramatically than surface water, though stratification still exists, while in the winter surface water temperatures see a larger increase. Stratification is reduced in winter months due to thermal pollution, often eliminating the thermocline.A study looking at the effect of a removed nuclear power plant in Lake Stechlin, Germany, found a 2.33°C increase persisted in surface water during the winter and a 2.04°C increase persisted in deep water during the summer, with marginal increases throughout the water column in both winter and summer. Stratification and water temperature differences due to thermal pollution seem to correlate with nutrient cycling of phosphorus and nitrogen, as oftentimes water bodies that receive coolant will shift toward eutrophication. No clear data has been obtained on this though, as it is difficult to differentiate influences from other industry and agriculture.Similar to effects seen in aquatic systems due to climatic warming of water, thermal pollution has also been seen to increase surface temperatures in the summer. This can create surface water temperatures that lead to releases of warm air into the atmosphere, increasing air temperature. It therefore can be seen as a contributor to global warming. Many ecological effects will be compounded by climate change as well, as ambient temperature rises in water bodies.Spacial and climatic factors can impact the severity of water warming due to thermal pollution. High wind speeds tend to increase the impact of thermal pollution. Rivers and large bodies of water also tend to lose the effects of thermal pollution as they progress from the source.Rivers present a unique problem with thermal pollution. As water temperatures are elevated upstream, power plants downstream receive warmer waters. Evidence of this effect has been seen along the Mississippi River, as power plants are forced to use warmer waters as their coolants. This reduces the efficiency of the plants and forces the plants to use more water and produce more thermal pollution.\\', \\'WikipageID\\': 1732697, \\'LastModified\\': \\'2023-08-20T13:38:34Z\\', \\'split\\': \\'Water warming effects, as opposed to water cooling effects, have been the most studied with regard to biogeochemical effects.

      "As a Contamination expert with knowledge of the effects of thermal pollution on aquatic ecosystems, I can provide information on how thermal contamination from power plants can impact aquatic biodiversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thermal contamination from power plants can have both short-term and long-term effects on aquatic biodiversity. In the short term, increased water temperatures due to warm coolant discharge can lead to changes in the distribution and abundance of aquatic organisms. For example, some species may be more tolerant of warmer waters and may thrive in these conditions, while others may be less tolerant and may experience reduced populations or even local extinctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the long term, however, thermal contamination can have more profound effects on aquatic biodiversity. For example, persistent increases in water temperature can lead to changes in the physical and chemical properties of the water body, such as decreased dissolved oxygen levels or increased nutrient loading, which can have cascading impacts on the entire ecosystem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, thermal contamination can also affect the stratification of lakes and similar water bodies, leading to different effects on a seasonal basis. For example, during the summer months, warm surface waters may become more isolated from cooler deeper waters, leading to reduced mixing and increased nutrient loading in these surface waters. This can lead to the development of harmful algal blooms and decreased water quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the effects of thermal contamination on aquatic biodiversity are complex and depend on a variety of factors, including the magnitude and duration of the temperature increase, the type of coolant used by the power plant, and the specific ecosystem in question. However, research has shown that long-term exposure to thermal pollution can have significant negative impacts on aquatic biodiversity, and it is important for power plants to carefully consider these effects when designing their operations and waste management strategies.\n",

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \\\\\\'The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\"Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored.

The glare of street lights causes distraction to nocturnal birds in flight, leading to bird crashes into sky scrapers and buildings. The use of light may also cause birds to reproduce or migrate too early. The feeding behavior of insects, bats, sea turtles, fish, and reptiles reflect alterations by artificial light.

      "Hello! As a helpful and respectful assistant, I'm here to provide you with information on the effects of light pollution on nocturnal animals and ecosystems. Light pollution is the adverse effects of artificial light, and it can have significant impacts on various species and ecosystems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nocturnal wildlife, such as birds, insects, bats, sea turtles, fish, and reptiles, are affected by light pollution in several ways. The glare of street lights can cause distraction to nocturnal birds in flight, leading to bird crashes into sky scrapers and buildings. Additionally, the use of light may cause these animals to reproduce or migrate too early, altering their natural behavior patterns.\n",

      "In conclusion, light pollution has significant adverse effects on nocturnal animals and ecosystems. It can disrupt their natural behavior patterns, affect their reproduction and migration habits, and lead to a waste of economic resources. By taking measures to reduce light pollution, such as using energy-efficient lights and turning off unnecessary lights, we can help protect these species and promote sustainability.\n",

      "Hello! I'm here to help you with your question. However, before we proceed, I would like to point out that the term \"improper disposal\" can be perceived as judgmental and might not accurately reflect the complexities of plastic waste management. Instead, it would be more appropriate to say \"inappropriate or irresponsible disposal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding your question, when plastic is disposed of in a way that does not follow proper guidelines, such as being buried in soil without proper treatment or recycling, it can contribute to soil contamination. This is because plastic materials can leach chemicals into the soil and groundwater, potentially causing harm to human health and the environment. Additionally, if the plastic degrades over time, it can release microplastics that can be ingested by plants and animals, leading to further contamination.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that not all plastic materials are created equal when it comes to their potential for soil contamination. For example, some types of plastic may be more resistant to degradation than others, which can affect the rate at which they release chemicals into the environment. Additionally, the presence of other factors such as sunlight, heat, and microorganisms can also impact the degradation process.\n",

      "To mitigate the risks associated with plastic disposal, it's important to follow proper guidelines for recycling or safe disposal.

During the 1970s, mangroves occupied as much as 200,000 km2, encompassing approximately 75% of the world\\\\\\'s coastlines. Now, global mangrove area has experienced significant decline where at least 35% has been lost. Mangroves are continuing to diminish at a rate of 1-2% per year. Much of this lost mangrove area was destroyed to make room for industry, housing and tourism development; for aquaculture, primarily shrimp farms; and for agriculture, such as rice paddies, livestock pasture and salt production. Other drivers of mangrove forest destruction include activities that divert their sources of freshwater, such as groundwater withdrawals, the building of dams, and the building of roads and drainage canals across tidal flats. Another indirect human activity, climate change, also threatens mangrove habitat. Sea levels are on the rise as polar ice caps melt from increasing temperatures and thermal expansion. Depending on sediment accumulation, mangrove habitats will generally respond to sea level change in three different ways: (1) If the sediment in the mangrove forest rises faster than the sea level, plants from further inland may move into the area as the mangroves retreat; (2) if the rate of sediment accumulation is equal to the rate of sea level rise, the forest survives and is stable during this period and (3) if the rate of soil accumulation is slower than the rate of sea level rise, the mangrove forest will be submerged by the sea. However, mangroves may then adapt and spread more inland as new territory is made for mangrove habitat. It is important to note that changes may deviate from these three general scenarios depending on local morphological/topographical features. However, there are limits to the capacity of mangroves to adapt to climate change. It is projected that a 1-meter rise in sea level could inundate and destroy mangrove forests in many regions around the globe. Mangroves play a vital role in delivering essential ecosystem services for the benefit of both humans and wildlife. The loss of these invaluable services will have a significant negative impact on the world. Mangrove habitat loss leaves coastal communities vulnerable to the risks of flooding, shoreline erosion, saline intrusion, and increased storm activity. Ecosystem services such as water purification and  collection of raw materials are not possible if mangroves are utilized unsustainably. Furthermore, the decline of mangrove communities heavily impacts the plants and animals that rely on the habitat for survival. Loss of mangroves leads to reduced water quality, reduced biodiversity, increased sedimentation threatening coral reefs, and collapse of intertidal food webs and aquatic nurseries.

      "Hello! As a helpful and respectful assistant, I'm here to provide you with accurate and socially unbiased information. Mangrove forests play a crucial role in preventing coastal water contamination in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sedimentation: The roots of the mangrove trees absorb floodwaters and slow down the flow of sediment-loaded river water, allowing sediments to drop to the bottom where they are held in place. This helps contain potentially toxic waste products and improves the quality of water and sanitation in coastal communities.\n",
      "2. Carbon sequestration: Mangrove forests have been shown to sequester carbon in quantities comparable to higher-canopy terrestrial rainforests, which can help mitigate climate change. This is especially important as coastal areas are vulnerable to the impacts of sea-level rise and increased storm activity due to climate change.\n",
      "3. Habitat protection: Mangrove forests provide crucial habitats for fish and crustacean species of commercial importance, such as the Atlantic goliath grouper. By protecting these habitats, mangroves help maintain biodiversity and ensure the long-term health of coastal ecosystems.\n",
      "4. Water filtration: The complex root system of mangrove trees acts as a natural filter, trapping sediments and pollutants before they can enter the water. This helps keep coastal waters clean and free from contaminants.\n",
      "5. Erosion control: Mangrove roots also physically buffer shorelines from the erosive impacts of ocean waves and storms, protecting coastlines from damage and preventing sedimentation in nearby waters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, mangrove forests play a vital role in maintaining the health of coastal ecosystems by preventing contamination, sequestering carbon, providing habitat for marine life, filtering water, and controlling erosion.\n",

Coal includes contaminants such as sulfur compounds and non-combustible minerals. When coal is burned, the minerals become ash (i.e. particulate matter or PM), and the sulfur forms sulfur dioxide (SO2). Since air is mostly nitrogen, the combustion of coal often leads to the production of nitrogen oxides. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are the primary causes of acid rain. For many years—before greenhouse gasses were widely understood to be a threat—it was thought that these by-products were the only drawback to using coal. These by-products are still a problem, but they have been greatly diminished in most advanced countries due to clean air regulations. It is possible to remove most of the sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) emissions from the coal-burning process. For example, various techniques are used in a coal preparation plant to reduce the amount of non-combustible matter (i.e. ash) in the coal before burning. During combustion, fluidized bed combustion is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. After burning, particulate matter (i.e. ash and dust) can be reduced using an electrostatic precipitator, and sulfur dioxide emissions can be further reduced with flue-gas desulfurization. Trace amounts of radionuclides are more difficult to remove.[citation neededCoal-fired power plants are the largest aggregate source of the toxic heavy metal mercury: 50 tons per year come from coal power plants out of 150 tons emitted nationally in the US and 5000 tons globally. However, according to the United States Geological Survey, the trace amounts of mercury in coal by-products do not pose a threat to public health. A study in 2013 found that mercury found in the fish in the Pacific Ocean could possibly be linked to coal-fired plants in Asia.[citation needed] ==== Coal pollution produces smog ==== A visibly persistent example of the effects of pollution from burning coal is the “smog and soot which had serious health impacts on residents of growing urban centers.” Smog is a colloid that is formed when sunlight reacts with gaseous nitrogen oxides and at least one volatile organic compound (VOC) latent within the atmosphere. Smog is often visible to the naked human eye, and exists as a hazy, white smoke sometimes causing acute irritation of the eyes, nose, and respiratory system. The two main sources that cause smog are primary and secondary pollution. Primary pollution is emitted directly from a source, such as driving a car, burning coal, burning fossil fuels, etc., whereas secondary pollution is formed in the atmosphere, such as natural chemical reactions between sunlight and ozone. According from the Water and Air Pollution  \"The great smog of 1952 was caused by the mass production of burning coal, killing 4,000 people in londonWater and Air Pollution, and in “1948 there was severe industrial air pollution created deadly smog that asphyxiated 20 people in Donora Pennsylvania and made 7,000 more people sick.” ==== Measurement of pollution and availability of pollution data ==== In some countries, such as the EU, smokestack measurements from individual power plants must be published. Meanwhile, in some countries, such as Turkey, they are only reported to the government, not the public. However, since the late 2010s satellite measurements of some pollutants have been available. ==== Greenhouse gasses ==== Combustion of coal —a sedimentary rock composed primarily of carbon— produces carbon dioxide. According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the burning of coal, a fossil fuel, is a significant contributor to global warming. (See the UN IPCC Fourth Assessment Report). Burning 1 ton of coal produces 2.86 tons of carbon dioxide. Carbon sequestration technology, to remove significant quantities of carbon dioxide from the air, has yet to be tested on a large scale and may not be safe or successful. Sequestered CO2 may eventually leak up through the ground, may lead to unexpected geological instability or may cause contamination of aquifers used for drinking water supplies.[citation needed] Carbon capture and storage is applied at large point emitters of carbon dioxide with the objective of preventing it from entering the atmosphere.

      "5. Heavy metals: Burning coal can release heavy metals like mercury, arsenic, and lead into the air, posing health risks to humans and wildlife.\n",
      "6. Carbon monoxide (CO): Coal combustion releases CO, which can replace oxygen in the bloodstream, leading to serious health problems.\n",
      "7. Organic carbon: Burning coal releases organic carbon compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxins, which are known to be carcinogenic.\n",
      "8. Fluorinated gases (F-gases): Some coal-fired power plants may release F-gases, such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which are potent greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.\n",

It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.Air quality is closely related to the earth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s health status and genetics.Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death, with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1 million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years, and is the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s largest single environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Worst Polluted Places report. The scope of the air pollution crisis is large: In 2018, WHO estimated that \"9 out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants.\" Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected.Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately regulated and monitored. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative effects of air pollution. Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health. Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol, which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which reduced sulfur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been less successful.\\\\\\', \\\\\\'WikipageID\\\\\\': 10934212, \\\\\\'LastModified\\\\\\': \\\\\\'2023-12-22T22:21:28Z\\\\\\', \\\\\\'split\\\\\\': \"Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.

      "1. Reduced plant growth and productivity: Air pollution can damage plants' leaves, stems, and roots, leading to reduced growth rates, lower yields, and decreased fruit quality. This is particularly true for sensitive species like trees and ornamental plants.\n",
      "2. Increased susceptibility to disease: Air pollutants can weaken plants' defense mechanisms, making them more vulnerable to diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, or viruses. This can lead to widespread outbreaks and significant losses for urban agriculture and green spaces.\n",
      "3. Altered plant chemistry: Certain air pollutants, such as ozone and sulfur dioxide, can alter the chemical composition of plants' tissues, affecting their nutritional value and potential toxicity to humans and wildlife.\n",
      "4. Changes in soil properties: Air pollution can also impact soil quality by increasing its acidity or reducing its organic matter content. This can make it more difficult for plants to absorb essential nutrients, leading to stunted growth and reduced productivity.\n",
      "5. Decreased biodiversity: Air contamination can alter the composition of urban ecosystems, favoring certain species over others. This can lead to a loss of biodiversity, as some plant and animal species may be unable to survive in polluted environments.\n",
      "6. Increased risk of wildfires: Dry conditions exacerbated by air pollution can increase the risk of wildfires in urban areas, posing a threat to both human life and vegetation.\n",
      "7. Negative impacts on ecosystem services: Urban green spaces provide essential ecosystem services like carbon sequestration, air filtration, and habitat creation. Air contamination can reduce the effectiveness of these services, compromising the health and well-being of urban populations.\n",
      "8. Reduced aesthetic value: Air pollution can damage plants' appearance, reducing their ornamental value and negatively impacting the overall visual quality of green spaces. This can lead to decreased property values and reduced economic activity in urban areas.\n",
      "9. Increased maintenance costs: Air contamination can require more frequent pruning, watering, and fertilization to maintain plant health, leading to increased maintenance costs for urban vegetation and green spaces.\n",
      "10. Human health impacts: Exposure to air pollution in urban areas can have significant negative impacts on human health, including respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer. This can lead to increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity for urban populations.\n",

It is a combination of chemicals and trash, most of which comes from land sources and is washed or blown into the ocean. This pollution results in damage to the environment, to the health of all organisms, and to economic structures worldwide. Since most inputs come from land, either via the rivers, sewage or the atmosphere, it means that continental shelves are more vulnerable to pollution. Air pollution is also a contributing factor by carrying off iron, carbonic acid, nitrogen, silicon, sulfur, pesticides or dust particles into the ocean. The pollution often comes from nonpoint sources such as agricultural runoff, wind-blown debris, and dust. These nonpoint sources are largely due to runoff that enters the ocean through rivers, but wind-blown debris and dust can also play a role, as these pollutants can settle into waterways and oceans. Pathways of pollution include direct discharge, land runoff, ship pollution, bilge pollution, atmospheric pollution and, potentially, deep sea mining. The types of marine pollution can be grouped as pollution from marine debris, plastic pollution, including microplastics, ocean acidification, nutrient pollution, toxins and underwater noise. Plastic pollution in the ocean is a type of marine pollution by plastics, ranging in size from large original material such as bottles and bags, down to microplastics formed from the fragmentation of plastic material. Marine debris is mainly discarded human rubbish which floats on, or is suspended in the ocean. Plastic pollution is harmful to marine life. Another concern is the runoff of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from intensive agriculture, and the disposal of untreated or partially treated sewage to rivers and subsequently oceans. These nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients (which are also contained in fertilizers) stimulate phytoplankton and macroalgal growth, which can lead to harmful algal blooms (eutrophication) which can be harmful to humans as well as marine creatures. Excessive algal growth can also smother sensitive coral reefs and lead to loss of biodiversity and coral health. A second major concern is that the degradation of algal blooms can lead to consumption of oxygen in coastal waters, a situation that may worsen with climate change as warming reduces vertical mixing of the water column.Many potentially toxic chemicals adhere to tiny particles which are then taken up by plankton and benthic animals, most of which are either deposit feeders or filter feeders. In this way, the toxins are concentrated upward within ocean food chains. When pesticides are incorporated into the marine ecosystem, they quickly become absorbed into marine food webs. Once in the food webs, these pesticides can cause mutations, as well as diseases, which can be harmful to humans as well as the entire food web. Toxic metals can also be introduced into marine food webs. These can cause a change to tissue matter, biochemistry, behavior, reproduction, and suppress growth in marine life. Also, many animal feeds have a high fish meal or fish hydrolysate content. In this way, marine toxins can be transferred to land animals, and appear later in meat and dairy products.\\', \\'WikipageID\\': 2127046, \\'LastModified\\': \\'2023-12-21T17:25:32Z\\', \\'split\\': \\'When pesticides are incorporated into the marine ecosystem, they quickly become absorbed into marine food webs.

      "Hello! I'm here to help you with your question. The contamination of marine ecosystems with heavy metals can have a significant impact on both seafood safety and human health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heavy metals, such as mercury, lead, and arsenic, are known to bioaccumulate in the tissues of fish and other seafood, posing a risk to human health when consumed. These metals can cause a range of health problems, including neurological damage, kidney damage, and birth defects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the incorporation of heavy metals into marine food webs can lead to biomagnification, where the concentration of these metals increases as they move up the food chain. This means that larger predatory fish and seafood species can accumulate high levels of heavy metals in their bodies, making them unsafe for human consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the presence of heavy metals in marine ecosystems can also impact the reproduction and growth of marine life, leading to long-term effects on the health and biodiversity of these ecosystems.\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure seafood safety and protect human health, it is important to monitor the levels of heavy metals in seafood and take steps to reduce their presence in marine ecosystems. This can include implementing sustainable fishing practices, reducing industrial pollution, and promoting the use of alternative feeds for aquaculture that do not contain heavy metals.\n",

In response to your question about the key challenges in enforcing international agreements on pollution control and how they can be addressed, here are some points to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Challenges in Enforcing International Agreements on Pollution Control:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Lack of political will and commitment from governments: One of the significant challenges is the lack of political will and commitment from governments to enforce international agreements on pollution control. Governments may prioritize economic growth over environmental protection, leading to lax enforcement of regulations.\n",
      "2. Limited resources and capacity: Developing countries often face resource constraints and limited institutional capacity, making it challenging for them to effectively implement and enforce international agreements on pollution control.\n",
      "3. Inadequate monitoring and reporting mechanisms: The absence of robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms can make it difficult to track progress and ensure compliance with international agreements on pollution control.\n",
      "4. Conflicting priorities and competing interests: Different stakeholders may have conflicting priorities and competing interests, which can hinder the effective enforcement of international agreements on pollution control. For example, industry groups may resist stricter regulations that could increase their costs, while environmental organizations may push for more stringent measures to protect public health and the environment.\n",
      "5. Lack of public awareness and engagement: Inadequate public awareness and engagement can make it challenging to build support for international agreements on pollution control and ensure compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Addressing these Challenges:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Strengthening political will and commitment: Governments should demonstrate a strong commitment to enforcing international agreements on pollution control by allocating sufficient resources, establishing clear policies, and engaging with stakeholders.\n",
      "2. Building capacity and resource mobilization: Developed countries can provide technical assistance and financial support to help developing countries build their institutional capacity and mobilize resources for implementing and enforcing international agreements on pollution control.\n",
      "3. Improving monitoring and reporting mechanisms: International organizations, governments, and other stakeholders should work together to develop robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms that can track progress and ensure compliance with international agreements on pollution control.\n",
      "4. Balancing competing interests: Stakeholder engagement and collaboration are essential for balancing competing interests and ensuring the effective enforcement of international agreements on pollution control. This includes working with industry groups, environmental organizations, and local communities to find solutions that benefit all parties.\n",
      "5. Public awareness and education: Raising public awareness and engaging citizens in the implementation and enforcement of international agreements on pollution control can help build support for these initiatives and ensure compliance. This could involve educational campaigns, community outreach programs, and other forms of public engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, addressing key challenges in enforcing international agreements on pollution control requires a multi-faceted approach that involves strengthening political will, building capacity, improving monitoring and reporting mechanisms, balancing competing interests, and raising public awareness. By working together to overcome these challenges, we can ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of international agreements on pollution control and protect our environment for future generations.\n"
